      "[u'Met-tRNAfMet from Escherichia coli is utilized efficiently as an elongator tRNA during protein synthesis in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate since it rapidly incorporates its methionyl residue into the same tryptic peptides of rabbit globin as the endogenous Met-tRNAmMet.', u'Therefore, it must lack the structural characteristics that prevent the eukaryotic initiator tRNA from entering elongation.', u'In contrast, E. coli Met-tRNAfMet appears to initiate very poorly since, unlike reticulocyte Met-tRNAiMet, it forms no detectable 43 S preinitiation complexes, and only a very small fraction of the methionine it contributes to polyribosomal peptidyl-tRNA is found at the N terminus.', u'The bacterial fMet-tRNAfMet, which cannot elongate, is utilized for polypeptide chain initiation at a much lower level than the formylated Met-tRNAiMet from eukaryotes.', u'The ability of E. coli Met-tRNAfMet to be used as an elongator and fMet-tRNAfMet as an initiator in the reticulocyte lysate may be considerably underestimated because of the rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of these initiator tRNAs in the lysate.', u'The enzyme hydrolyzes fMet-tRNAfMet and Met-tRNAfMet from E. coli in a strictly Mg2+-dependent manner but not the corresponding species from yeast or rabbit reticulocytes.', u'It also hydrolyzes yeast N-acetyl-Phe-tRNAPhe and reticulocyte peptidyl-tRNA, showing that this enzyme--like the eukaryotic protein synthetic machinery--does not readily distinguish the bacterial tRNAfMet from eukaryotic elongator tRNA.']\n",

      "Intra- and extra-synaptosomal activity of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and -B (MAO-B), dopamine (DA) and its main metabolites were examined to clarify the mechanism of action(s) of p-hydroxyamphetamine (p-OHA) in animal behaviour mediated by central dopaminergic systems.\n",
      "Intrasynaptosomal DA was oxidized by MAO-A and MAO-B and this oxidation is inhibited by p-OHA.\n",
      "The inhibition is due to two effects: 1) uptake of DA is inhibited by p-OHA, and 2) p-OHA also inhibits intrasynaptosomal oxidation of DA by MAO-A and MAO-B.\n",
      "The inhibition of oxidation by MAO-A is predominant.\n",
      "Administration (ICV) of 80 and 160 micrograms p-OHA to mice, doses that cause various behavioural, significantly reduced striatal DA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels, but greatly increased 3-methoxytyramine, without significantly changing homovanillic acid (HVA).\n",
      "The release of DA and blockade of DA uptake into dopaminergic neurons by p-OHA, together with preferential inhibition of the DA metabolizing enzyme, MAO-A, may contribute to p-OHA-induced behaviour mediated by the central dopaminergic systems.\n",
      "The product of beta-lactamase activity (a penicilloic acid in the case of a penicillin) is stoichiometrically oxidized by iodine.\n",
      "Hence, the beta-lactamase activity can be measured as decolorization of the blue starch-iodine complex.\n",
      "Since the decolorization is a slow process, the rate of decolorization gave an underestimate of the rate of penicillin hydrolysis until a steady state was obtained after 15 to 20 min.\n",
      "If the reaction mixture (3 ml) contained no more than 0.001 unit of enzyme, a correct determination of beta-lactamase activity was obtained from the microiodometric method described.\n",
      "The method is sensitive and some applications are mentioned.\n",
      "Modern medical technology has made available a complex array of testing methods for drugs of abuse.\n",
      "The gathering of the best information from these methods demands that the clinician be familiar with the different testing protocols.\n",
      "In this, the third article in a monthly series, the authors discuss the more common and useful tests and describe their use for optimal results.\n",
      "The mean defect index of Flammer and the mean deviation index of Heijl have been compared based on a study of 169 glaucomatous visual fields.\n",
      "It is shown that in the cases studied the differences between the two indices are negligible for Octopus G1 program results and that they may thus be used interchangeably.\n",
      "Administration of a single oral dose of 60 mg/kg O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate (OOS-Me), a malathion impurity, resulted in a substantial increase in the amounts of amino acids along with a change in the nature of proteins excreted in the urine of treated rats.\n",
      "In contrast to control rats, a small increase in albumin and a small decrease in alpha 1-globulin were observed.\n",
      "However, alpha2-, beta- and gamma 1-globulin, which were not detected in the urine of control rats, were found in substantial amounts in the urine of OOS-Me-treated rats.\n",
      "These findings, coupled with observed increases in urinary glucose levels and consistent specific gravity readings of 1.01 even though treated rats were experiencing oliguria, provide evidence for OOS-Me-induced kidney tubule damage.\n",
      "Based on evidence that 50% of herpes simplex 1 DNA is transcribed in HEp-2 cells in the absence of protein synthesis we examined the order and rates of synthesis of viral polypeptides in infected cells after reversal of cycloheximide- or puromycin-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis.\n",
      "These experiments showed that viral polypeptides formed three sequentially synthesized, coordinately regulated groups designated alpha, beta, and gamma.\n",
      "Specifically: (i) The alpha group, containing one minor structural and several nonstructural polypeptides, was synthesized at highest rates from 3 to 4 h postinfection in untreated cells and at diminishing rates thereafter.\n",
      "The beta group, also containing minor structural and nonstructural polypeptides, was synthesized at highest rates from 5 to 7 h and at decreasing rates thereafter.\n",
      "The gamma group containing major structural polypeptides was synthesized at increasing rates until at least 12 h postinfection.\n",
      "(ii) The synthesis of alpha polypeptides did not require prior infected cell protein synthesis.\n",
      "In contrast, the synthesis of beta polypeptides required both prior alpha polypeptide synthesis as well as new RNA synthesis, since the addition of actinomycin D immediately after removal of cycloheximide precluded beta polypeptide synthesis.\n",
      "The function supplied by the alpha polypeptides was stable since interruption of protein synthesis after alpha polypeptide synthesis began and before beta polypeptides were made did not prevent the immediate synthesis of beta polypeptides once the drug was withdrawn.\n",
      "The requirement of gamma polypeptide synthesis for prior synthesis of beta polypeptides seemed to be similar to that of beta polypeptides for prior synthesis of the alpha group.\n",
      "(iii) The rates of synthesis of alpha polypeptides were highest immediately after removal of cycloheximide and declined thereafter concomitant with the initiation of beta polypeptide synthesis; this decline in alpha polypeptide synthesis was less rapid in the presence of actinomycin D which prevented the appearance of beta and gamma polypeptides.\n",
      "The decrease in rates of synthesis of beta polypeptides normally occurring after 7 h postinfection was also less rapid in the presence of actinomycin D than in its absence, whereas ongoing synthesis of gamma polypeptides at this time was rapidly reduced by actinomycin D. (iv) Inhibitors of DNA synthesis (cytosine arabinoside or hydroxyurea) did not prevent the synthesis of alpha, beta, or gamma polypeptides, but did reduce the amounts of gamma polypeptides made.\n",
      "The drinking behavior and alcohol-induced facial flushing of 1646 Japanese men (50.9% flushers and 48.0% nonflushers) were analyzed from questionnaires completed by their wives.\n",
      "The results indicate a relationship between flushing and various indices of sensitivity to alcohol and low rates of alcohol-related problems.\n",
      "It is proposed that alcohol-induced flushing acts as an inhibitory factor against excessive alcohol use and consequent problems due to drinking.\n",
      "Two cases with significant eating disturbances are described.\n",
      "Both possess several characteristic symptoms of anorexia but lack a primary drive for thinness or body image disturbances.\n",
      "Similarly, neither engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating which is typical of bulimia.\n",
      "The authors propose the differential diagnoses of atypical eating disorder rather than conversion disorder as a more descriptive and accurate diagnostic label.\n",
      "Studies are reported pertaining to platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG) and IgM (PAIgM) in patients with thrombocytopenias considered possibly immune-mediated on clinical grounds.\n",
      "Approximately 14 percent of all patients with these disorders had elevated PAIgM but normal levels of PAIgG.\n",
      "Of patients with classic autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there was a trend toward more frequently normal levels of PAIgG in chronic ITP compared with patients with acute ITP, but this was not statistically significant.\n",
      "Patients with acute ITP had higher levels of PAIgG and PAIgM in general than those with chronic ITP.\n",
      "Patterns of PAIgG and/or PAIgM elevation were not significantly different when chronic and acute ITP were compared, nor when childhood ITP was compared with adult ITP.\n",
      "Patients with immune thrombocytopenias owing to malignant disorders were likely to have lower levels of PAIgG compared with those with classic ITP.\n",
      "Treated patients with immune thrombocytopenias showed a trend toward earlier response to therapy if they had only elevated PAIgG as opposed to elevated PAIgM alone or elevated PAIgM and PAIgG (p = 0.17).\n",
      "There appear to be great overlaps in the patterns and quantities of PAIgG and PAIgM in patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenias in widely varied clinical settings.\n",
      "This suggests some underlying common pathophysiologic mechanisms for thrombocytopenia in these clinically diverse disorders.\n",
      "It is believed that the data are most consistent with the hypothesis that thrombocytopenia in patients with elevated PAIgG and/or PAIgM is most probably of immune origin even in such diverse disorders as systemic lupus erythematosus, cirrhosis of the liver, lymphoma, leukemia, cancer, or septic conditions, as well as in ITP.\n",
      "Alveolar macrophages (AM) have been extensively studied, but whether these lavageable cells are representative of the lung's interstitial macrophage population is unknown.\n",
      "Previous investigators have compared AM with macrophages obtained from mechanically disrupted whole lung tissue and have found both populations to be morphologically and functionally similar.\n",
      "In such studies, neither the anatomical origin of the macrophages harvested from lung tissue postlavage nor the quantitative removal of AM by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was demonstrated.\n",
      "Accordingly, the extent to which unlavaged AM contributed to the macrophage population obtained from mechanically disrupted lung tissue remains obscure.\n",
      "The present study was undertaken to determine whether macrophages harvested by mechanical disruption of lung tissue following exhaustive BAL are in fact primarily of interstitial origin.\n",
      "We addressed this problem by labeling rat AM with opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC-IgG) in situ, exhaustively lavaging the lungs to remove AM, and then mincing the residual lung tissue to liberate unlavaged macrophages for subsequent in vitro analyses.\n",
      "We recovered 24.5 +/- 1.3 X 10(6) AM with 18 lavages, 79.5 +/- 2.5% of which had phagocytized SRBC-IgG.\n",
      "Mincing the lavaged tissue resulted in the further release of 2.7 +/- 0.4 X 10(6) viable cells, approximately 85% of which morphologically appeared to be macrophages.\n",
      "The percentage of these cells that were prelabeled with SRBC-IgG and the numerical distribution of the SRBC-IgG among them were virtually identical to those among AM.\n",
      "The percentage of SRBC-IgG-containing macrophages was increased only slightly (11.4 +/- 1.9%) by further incubating macrophages harvested from minced lung with the SRBC-IgG in vitro, and most of this increase could be accounted for by unlavaged AM that did not phagocytize the test particles in situ.\n",
      "Moreover, multiparameter flow cytometric analyses of macrophages obtained by BAL and from minced lung tissue demonstrated that these populations were identical in terms of size, light scatter properties, and laser-excited blue and green-yellow autofluorescence characteristics.\n",
      "We conclude that (1) exhaustive lavage fails to retrieve a significant number of AM, and (2) macrophages obtained by mechanically disrupting lung tissue are derived primarily from the alveolar space compartment and not the interstitial compartment, as some investigators contend.\n",
      "We observed a dangerous increase of ventricular rate following the intravenous administration of amiodarone in a patient with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\n",
      "The mechanism of enhanced accessory pathway conduction remains speculative.\n",
      "A possible explanation for the shortened antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathway is afforded by the hypotensive action of amiodarone or its dissolvent which might trigger beta-adrenergic reflexes.\n",
      "Intravenous amiodarone should be used with caution in patients with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response via an accessory pathway.\n",
      "Mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) decreases urine output and urinary sodium excretion.\n",
      "The influence of PEEP during controlled mechanical ventilation on the circulating concentrations of the N-terminus and C-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) prohormone which both contain natriuretic and diuretic peptides was investigated in 7 patients with acute respiratory failure.\n",
      "The 98 amino acid (aa) N-terminus, the midportion of the N-terminus consisting of aa 31-67 of the 126 aa ANF prohormone (i.e., pro ANF 31-67) and the C-terminus (aa 99-126; ANF) were found to be significantly (p less than 0.05; ANOVA) elevated compared to 54 healthy volunteers during acute respiratory failure prior to institution of PEEP.\n",
      "With institution of 10 cm of H2O of PEEP all 7 patients had a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in the circulating concentrations of pro ANFs 1-98, 31-67 and ANF.\n",
      "These findings suggest that the increased thoracic pressure secondary to PEEP which reduces venous return and lowers atrial filling pressure results in a decreased release of the N-terminus and C-terminus of the ANF prohormone.\n",
      "This decrease in the N-terminus and C-terminus of the ANF prohormone appears to represent a physiologic mechanism for restoration of intravascular volume, secondary to decreased sodium excretion.\n",
      "A comprehensive analysis is reported in 376 healthy middle and old-age persons, including measurements of bone mineral content (BMC) of the mid-radias, pituitary sex hormones (RIA), serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, urinary calcium, phosphate, hydroxyproline (BCA), daily intake of protein and calcium, physical exercise and activity, body weight, amenorrhea etc.\n",
      "Results showed that the preponderance of bone resorption over bone formation is the essential pathophysiological change of involutional osteoporosis.\n",
      "For females, bone loss is regulated mainly by estrogen in presenile group, co-regulated by estrogen and androgen in senile group.\n",
      "For males, urinary hydroxyproline excretion is also regulated by estrogen A remarkable correlation was observed between BMC and the following factors: serum calcium, urinary calcium, hydroxyproline, body weight, physical exercise, amenorrhea, intake of protein and calcium.\n",
      "Our data indicated that the intake of calcium daily in old chinese should not be lower than 700 mg (male) and 900 mg (female), protein should not be lower than 60-70 g. The age of onset, prevalence rate and BMC average reduction rate of osteoporosis in chinese were also observed in the studies.\n",
      "In this paper the immunosuppressive effects of Gui Zhi Tang (a famous Chinese medicine) on the murine immune functions are reported.\n",
      "Varying dosages of Gui Zhi Tang administrated orally, i.p.\n",
      "and i.m.\n",
      "were able to inhibit the amounts of PFC, SRFC and the DTH response induced by BSA and the proliferation response of murine spleen cells to Con A and LPS.\n",
      "Further studies showed that Gui Zhi Tang had the inhibitory effect on Interleukin-2 production of murine spleen cells, which might be one of the mechanisms leading to the immunosuppressive effects of Gui Zhi Tang.\n",
      "A conservative attitude toward unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has been based on the belief that surgical resection is too risky and that their natural history is benign.\n",
      "We have operated on 103 patients with a cerebral AVM.\n",
      "In the 49 patients with unruptured AVMs, there was no mortality, and the morbidity was 14.2%.\n",
      "Similarly, low surgical morbidity has been reported from several centers during the last few years.\n",
      "The chance of hemorrhage for both ruptured and unruptured AVMs is about 3% per year, and the combined morbidity and mortality of each hemorrhage is at least 40%.\n",
      "All patients with an AVM should be individually considered for possible surgical resection, whether or not they have bled.\n",
      "We have investigated the effect of gestational age and fetal hypophysectomy on the growth and development of the adrenal gland of the fetal sheep.\n",
      "The area of the fetal sheep adrenal medulla increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from 3.21 +/- 0.42 mm2 at 90-107 days to 6.09 +/- 0.26 mm2 at 120-126 days of gestation and there was a further significant increase (P less than 0.05) in the newborn period to 9.48 +/- 0.85 mm2.\n",
      "The adrenomedullary area of the hypophysectomised fetal sheep (7.47 +/- 1.10 mm2) was not significantly different from that of the fetal sheep at 140-146 days of gestation or from that of the newborn lamb.\n",
      "The ratio of the area of the adrenal occupied by the cells which contained adrenaline (adrenaline zone) to the area of the adrenal occupied by the cells which contained noradrenaline (noradrenaline zone) was unchanged between 90 days of gestation and 12 days after birth.\n",
      "After hypophysectomy, the ratio of the adrenaline to noradrenaline zone was not significantly different from that in the adrenal medulla of the 140-146 days fetal sheep and the 10-12 days newborn lamb.\n",
      "This was investigated 24 weeks post-operatively by light and electron microscopy.\n",
      "The number of axons in the pulp at the root apex ranged from 7.5 to 76.2 per cent of the number in the contralateral control tooth.\n",
      "The myelinated fibres were smaller and did not penetrate as far as the coronal pulp.\n",
      "The smoking of freebase cocaine produces faster and higher peak blood and brain levels.\n",
      "Cocaine intoxication can produce virtually any psychiatric symptom.\n",
      "Significant medical complications include seizures, cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory arrest.\n",
      "An understanding of the neuropharmacology of cocaine enhances the identification of cocaine use and addiction.\n",
      "We report heterotopic chondro-ossification occurring in the hand of a young man in the absence of trauma.\n",
      "The differential diagnosis includes: bizarre periosteal osteochondromatous proliferations of the hands and feet, mature lesions of myositis ossificans, osteogenic sarcoma, confluent lesions of extra-articular synovial chondromatosis, and nodular forms of florid periostitis.\n",
      "True heterotopic bone formation is a benign condition, which of itself requires no specific treatment.\n",
      "The DNA synthesis (S) phase of cultured GC cells, a clonal rat pituitary tumor cell line, is characterized by increases in nuclear receptors for T3 and glucocorticoid (G) hormones.\n",
      "However, this increased receptor abundance appears functionally dissociated from the GH gene since GH messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is decreased in S-phase cells.\n",
      "We have now examined a putative structural correlate of this dissociation by measuring the abundance of T3 and G receptors and the GH gene in the nuclear matrix (NM)/scaffold fraction.\n",
      "NM of control and S-phase cultures both contained 30-50% of G receptors.\n",
      "Thirty to 50% of T3 receptors were also localized to NM of asynchronous cultures, but T3 receptor abundance (femtomoles per 100 micrograms of protein) was significantly decreased in NM of S-phase cultures: Exp 1 (control, 140 +/- 6.2; S-phase, 56.5 +/- 0.8; Exp 2 (control, 170 +/- 12; S-phase, 105 +/- 2.4).\n",
      "Nuclear scaffolds were digested with restriction enzymes to solubilize DNA loop structures and probed with GH complementary DNA (cDNA) to examine the distribution of transcribed regions of the GH gene.\n",
      "EcoR1 digestion resulted in an 11 kilobase fragment including the reported regulatory sequences for T3 receptors.\n",
      "No specific differences in GH gene localization to nuclear scaffold were observed between asynchronous and S-phase cultures or in different hormonal states.\n",
      "Thus, GH gene localization to nuclear scaffolds was not correlated with changes in transcription induced by T3 and G hormones or position in the cell cycle.\n",
      "These studies suggest that decreased concentration of T3 receptors in the NM fraction of S-phase cultures may be a structural correlate for cell cycle regulation of T3 receptor function.\n",
      "Fourteen primigravidas were evaluated at 32 and 36 weeks antepartum (AP) and 6 weeks postpartum (PP) to test the reliability and validity of a digital measure of pelvic muscle strength using urine control as the criterion.\n",
      "Interrater reliabilities ranged from .67 to .77.\n",
      "Convergent validity was shown by negative correlations between clinical muscle scores and time required to interrupt urine flow at 32 weeks AP (r = -.41), 36 weeks AP (r = -.64) and 6 weeks PP (r = -.71).\n",
      "Validity was also demonstrated in a pattern of lower scores in women who had urine loss during coughing or reported incontinence as compared with those who did not.\n",
      "Women who had cesarean births had higher postpartum pelvic muscle scores with progressively lower scores demonstrated by those who gave birth vaginally without laceration, with episiotomy, and with laceration, F(3, 10) = 5.40, p = .02.\n",
      "The Ca2+-binding kinetics of fura-2 and azo-1 were studied using temperature-jump relaxation methods.\n",
      "In 140 mM KCl at 20 degrees C, the association and dissociation rate constants for fura-2 were 6.02 x 10(8) M-1s-1 and 96.7 s-1, respectively.\n",
      "The fura-2 kinetics were insensitive to pH over the range 7.4 to 8.4.\n",
      "Azo-1 was studied in 140 mM KCl, at pH 7.4, at 10 degrees and 20 degrees C. At 10 degrees C, azo-1 exhibited association and dissociation rate constants of 1.43 x 10(8) M-1s-1 and 777.9 s-1, respectively; while at 20 degrees C, the corresponding values were 3.99 x 10(8) M-1s-1 and 1,177 s-1.\n",
      "The kinetic results demonstrate that fura-2 and azo-1 are well suited to monitoring rapid changes in intracellular [Ca2+].\n",
      "The authors investigated the modifications of neutrophil chemotaxis and cortisol plasma levels in the newborn delivered by cesarean section or vaginal delivery.\n",
      "Chemotaxis turned out to be higher in the group undergoing cesarean section, while cortisol was lower in this group.\n",
      "The increased activity of neutrophils can be explained with the lessened inhibitory effect of endogenous steroids and with the stimulating action of nitrous oxide.\n",
      "Light microscopic studies in our laboratory have indicated that the lateral septum, amygdala, and ventral subiculum project in a perinuclear fashion to the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), and suprachiasmatic (SCN) nuclei (Oldfield et al., '82; Silverman and Oldfield, '84).\n",
      "In the present paper a combined anterograde HRP and immunocytochemical procedure has been used to determine the connectivity between these limbic efferents and peptide-containing processes emanating from the above mentioned hypothalamic nuclei.\n",
      "Synaptic associations were found to exist between efferents from (1) the septum and both vasopressin (VP)- and oxytocin (OX)-positive dendrites derived from cells in the PVN and SON, (2) the septum and VP dendrites dorsal to the SCN, (3) the ventral subiculum and both VP and OX dendrites arising from the PVN and SON, and (iv) the amygdala and VP dendrites from the PVN.\n",
      "These observations help clarify an apparent discrepancy between electrophysiological data, in which limbic efferents have been shown to influence the activity of VP and OX neurons in the PVN and SON, and anatomical evidence which indicates only a perinuclear innervation from these sites not encroaching on the hypothalamic nuclei themselves.\n",
      "In each case the synaptic connections are made on dendrites external to the nucleus: those lateral and ventrolateral to the PVN, dorsal to the SON, and dorsal or dorsolateral to the SCN.\n",
      "Inequality in function of the left and right ovaries and uterine horns of mice was evaluated in three separate experiments.\n",
      "In Exp.\n",
      "1, the effect of position in the reproductive tract on various reproductive characteristics was evaluated in 158 pregnant hybrid mice.\n",
      "Ovulation rate, number of fetuses, total fetal weight and total placental weight were higher (P less than 0.05) on the right than the left on Day 18 of pregnancy (vaginal plug = Day 1).\n",
      "In Exp.\n",
      "2, the effect of previous sham or unilateral ovariectomy (right or left) in mated Swiss-Webster mice was compared with unoperated mated controls (N = 17-24/treatment).\n",
      "In control mice, ovulation rate, total fetal weight and ovarian weight were higher (P less than 0.05) on the right than left side.\n",
      "Surgery (sham or unilateral, ovariectomy) decreased (P less than 0.005) ovulation rates, number of fetuses, ovarian weights, total fetal weight and total placental weight on Day 18 of pregnancy.\n",
      "Unilateral ovariectomy decreased (P less than 0.05) ovulation rates and ovarian weights more than did sham operation.\n",
      "Ovulation rates were higher (P less than 0.01) when the left ovary was manipulated or removed rather than the right ovary.\n",
      "For Exp.\n",
      "3, pairs of 8 hybrid mouse embryos each (morulae and blastocysts) were surgically transferred to the left and right uterine horns of the same (bilateral, N = 15) or different (unilateral, N = 28) Swiss-Webster recipients.\n",
      "In almost all incidences, embryo survival (to Day 18 of pregnancy) was twice as high (P less than 0.05) in right than left uterine horns.\n",
      "We conclude that the left and right ovaries and uterine horns are not equal in function in Swiss-Webster and a hybrid strain of mice.\n",
      "Prevalence of human onchocerciasis in Tanzania is described.\n",
      "The prevalence is high in Bwakira (63.6 per cent), Mahenge (58.6 per cent) and Ruvuma (31.9 per cent); and low in Amani (22.4 per cent) foci when compared to that reported in 1970.\n",
      "The increase and decrease on the prevalence indicate that the disease transmission has been increasing and decreasing in the respective foci.\n",
      "It is speculated that bush clearing and deforestation in general, has positive effects on the transmission of onchocerciasis where Simulium damnosum complex is a vector and negative effects where Simulium neavei complex exists.\n",
      "The contrast dependence of simultaneous masking has been measured using isochromatic yellow-black luminance sinusoids and isoluminant red-green chrominance gratings.\n",
      "Masking functions for all four combinations of chromatic and luminance masks and tests are reported.\n",
      "In the two same-on-same conditions (luminance mask/luminance test and chromatic mask/chromatic test) these functions (increment threshold contrast versus mask contrast) have the typical dipper shape and are almost identical when test and mask contrasts are normalized to the unmasked contrast thresholds.\n",
      "The contrast dependence of the luminance mask/color test and color mask/luminance test functions are quite different.\n",
      "The luminance mask/color test shows facilitation over a broad range of both subthreshold and suprathreshold contrasts of the luminance mask.\n",
      "In the color mask/luminance test condition facilitation is never observed, but at suprathreshold contrasts a 2-cycle/degree (c/deg) chromatic grating masks a 2-c/deg luminance grating as strongly as does a luminance mask.\n",
      "The luminance mask/chromatic test results are invariant over the 0.25-2-c/deg spatial-frequency range, whereas the robust masking of luminance by color at 2 c/deg diminishes at lower spatial frequencies.\n",
      "The spatial-frequency selectivity of the luminance-facilitates-color interaction is much broader than facilitatory interactions in either the color-color or luminance-luminance conditions.\n",
      "Possible mechanisms of color-luminance interactions are considered.\n",
      "The lack of facilitation in the color mask/luminance test condition precludes a simple pedestal interpretation of this masking interaction.\n",
      "The data are, however, consistent with models that invoke inhibitory or more elaborate excitatory masking interactions.\n",
      "Three methods have been developed for measuring pseudo-alpha- and pseudo-beta-DL-glucose (pseudo-beta-D-glucose), synthetic compounds in which the ring oxygens of alpha- and beta-DL-glucose (beta-D-glucose) have been replaced by a methylene group.\n",
      "Moderate sensitivity in the determination of these pseudo-glucoses dissolved in human serum was obtained by GLC (0.1 nmol) and HPLC (0.5 nmol).\n",
      "The colorimetric determination with glucose 2-oxidase, peroxidase, and 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) was satisfactory for the assay of pseudo-alpha- and pseudo-beta-DL-glucose (respective sensitivities: 25 and 5 nmol).\n",
      "The addition of hexokinase to the colorimetric assay system made it possible to eliminate glucose present in the sample, such as serum, and the remaining pseudo-alpha- or pseudo-beta-DL-glucose in the sample solution could then be measured by a colorimetric method using glucose 2-oxidase.\n",
      "The methods described can be used for biochemical studies involving pseudo-alpha- and pseudo-beta-DL-glucose.\n",
      "Three polynucleotide phosphorylase mutations, isolated in heavily mutagenized Escherichia coli strains Q7, Q13, and Q27, were characterized after their transfer by P1 transduction to nearly isogenic strains which lack ribonuclease I.\n",
      "Each strain has a different altered form of polynucleotide phosphorylase.\n",
      "One enzyme exhibited sharply reduced activity under all conditions tested.\n",
      "A second had reduced activity which was stimulated by Mn(++).\n",
      "The third enzyme was thermolabile and could be >95% inactivated in vivo at 44 C and pH 6 if the cells were prevented from growing; during growth under these and other conditions, the full enzyme level was maintained.\n",

      "Severe aluminium-induced osteomalacia is refractory to treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 which frequently causes hypercalcemia.\n",
      "To further explore the mechanisms involved, we have utilized a model of short-term aluminium intoxication in the rat (total: 11 mg elemental aluminium in 3 weeks) to study (a) 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor status in a variety of classical and non-classical target organs for 1,25(OH)2D3; (b) circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 levels; (c) baseline duodenal calcium transport, utilising the Ussing chamber, to investigate the functional significance of receptor status in a classical target organ; and (d) duodenal calcium transport response to exogenously administered 1,25(OH)2D3.\n",
      "Both in the three week model and in the 16 week model (total: 41 mg elemental calcium) increased maximal specific binding capacity for 1,25(OH)2D3 (Nmax), that is, number of unoccupied receptors, was observed in nuclear fractions of all tissues studied.\n",
      "Receptor affinity, the apparent dissociation constant KD, was unchanged.\n",
      "Total binding capacity, measured after displacement of endogenous ligand by Mersalyl, that is, the sum of occupied plus non-occupied receptors, was also increased.\n",
      "Both circulating 1,25(OH)2D3, mucosa-to-serosa calcium flux (Jms) and net calcium flux (Jnet) were reduced under baseline conditions, suggesting the lack of a direct relationship between receptor expression and endorgan response.\n",
      "Following exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 administration, calcium Jms and Jnet were significantly lower in the aluminium intoxicated animals, with the increment induced in Jnet in aluminium intoxicated animals being 63% of that induced in controls.\n",
      "Our data suggest that resistance to the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in aluminium intoxication is postreceptor in nature.\n",
      "Immature female rats received implants containing 17 beta-estradiol on postnatal day 28 at 0900 h, followed 24 h later by either blank capsules or progesterone.\n",
      "Between 1500-1600 h on the day of progesterone (or blank capsule) implantation, these rats, a group of unoperated or sham controls, and a group of estrogen-progesterone-treated immature male rats were killed and perfused, and their brains processed for immunocytochemistry of c-fos antigen and LHRH.\n",
      "LHRH neurons consistently expressed c-fos after estrogen-progesterone treatment in females but not males; in only one of four females examined was c-fos induced after estrogen treatment.\n",
      "No fos was associated with LHRH neurons in the control groups.\n",
      "The LHRH neurons that expressed c-fos were located in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus; more rostral LHRH cells did not appear stimulated.\n",
      "These data demonstrate that gonadal steroids, administered in a paradigm that predictably produces timed stimulation of LH release, induce c-fos in LHRH neurons.\n",
      "The induction of c-fos in LHRH neurons provides a potentially useful and powerful tool for studying LHRH activation at the cellular level.\n",
      "Forty-one patients who underwent cardiac surgery under conditions of systemic hypothermia and intermittent cold crystalloid potassium cardioplegia were studied, in order to elucidate the effects of ventricular fibrillation and reperfusion on the myocardium, by using the intramyocardial pCO2 and temperature sensor.\n",
      "All patients were assigned to 2 groups, namely; group A (21 cases), in which the time between the aorta declamping and defibrillation was under 10 minutes, and group B (20 cases) in which the time was over 10 minutes.\n",
      "In both groups A and B, myocardial pCO2 increased at the rate of 3.58 +/- 1.70 and 2.16 +/- 0.62 mmHg/min (p less than 0.05) after aorta declamping, respectively and the myocardial pCO2 decreased at the rate of 5.59 +/- 0.60 and 4.18 +/- 0.76 mmHg/min (p less than 0.05) after defibrillation, respectively.\n",
      "In group A, the myocardial calcium content, pre-CPB (cardio pulmonary bypass) was 10.98 +/- 1.62 nmol/mg/dry weight and at the time of aorta declamping it was 15.90 +/- 1.81 nmol/mg/dry weight (p less than 0.05).\n",
      "In group B, the myocardial calcium content, pre-CPB, was 14.62 +/- 2.15 nmol/mg/dry weight and at the time of aorta declamping it was 18.23 +/- 4.36 nmol/mg/dry weight (p less than 0.05).\n",
      "At both three and six hours after the operation, the left ventricular work index per minute (LVWI) in group A showed better cardiac pump function than that in group B.\n",
      "We therefore conclude that when reperfusion is encountered, acidosis can be minimized by prompt defibrillation.\n",
      "The activities of the mung-bean (Phaseolus aureus L.) mitochondrial cyanide-insensitive oxidase and cytochrome pathways have been measured simultaneously.\n",

      "The effects of an orally active and selective beta 2-stimulant, procaterol (OPC-2009) on the isolated pulmonary smooth muscle and the release of chemical mediators from the passively sensitized lung fragments were studied and compared with those of isoprenaline (isoproterenol) and salbutamol.\n",
      "Procaterol potently relaxed the isolated guinea pig trachea and lung parenchyma in a concentration-dependent fashion.\n",
      "The drug at a similar range of concentrations antagonized the contraction of the isolated guinea pig trachea and lung parenchyma or human bronchus induced by leukotriene (LT) D4.\n",
      "Salbutamol and isoprenaline also showed similar effects to those of procaterol on the above experiments, but the potencies were consistently weaker than that of procaterol.\n",
      "The release of either histamine or LTs from the passively sensitized human lung fragments was markedly and dose-dependently inhibited by both the 5 min and 15 h treatment with procaterol (10(-10)-10(-7) mol/l) before antigen challenge.\n",
      "Isoprenaline and salbutamol in 5 min treatment experiments showed similar potency as and less potency than procaterol, respectively, on the release of these mediators, but the inhibition potencies of these drugs, particularly isoprenaline, were remarkably reduced by 15 h treatment.\n",
      "From these results, procaterol, besides the existing use as a bronchodilator, is expected to be a potentially prophylactic drug for allergic asthma because of the strong inhibition of the anaphylactic mediator release.\n",
      "The hormonal regulation of Na+-dependent phosphate transport was studied in opossum kidney (OK) cells.\n",
      "PTH caused time- and concentration-dependent decreases in Na+-dependent phosphate transport, with 10 pM PTH-(1-34) producing a 19% decline in phosphate transport.\n",
      "The EC50 for PTH inhibition of phosphate transport was 50 pM.\n",
      "Kinetic analyses of phosphate transport indicated that PTH decreased the maximum velocity without affecting the Km for phosphate.\n",

      "8-Bromo-cAMP and (Bu)2cAMP also inhibited phosphate transport.\n",
      "Forskolin increased cAMP formation and decreased phosphate transport, whereas the cyclase-inactive forskolin analog 1,9-dideoxyforskolin also inhibited phosphate transport.\n",
      "The PTH analog [8,18-norleucine,34-tyrosinamide]PTH-(3-34) reduced phosphate transport at concentrations from 10 nM to 30 microM, but did not increase cAMP formation at concentrations up to 10 microM.\n",
      "The adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine produced concentration-dependent decreases in PTH-stimulated cAMP formation, but did not influence PTH inhibition of Na+-dependent phosphate transport.\n",
      "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and prostaglandin E1 increased cAMP formation in OK cells, but were weak inhibitors of phosphate transport.\n",
      "This study suggests that cAMP may not be the only transmembrane signaling mechanism involved in the regulation of Na+-dependent phosphate transport by PTH-(1-34) in OK cells.\n",

      "As part of a population-based case-control study carried out in four areas of the United States, 427 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed between July 1, 1977, and December 31, 1981, and 1,683 controls were interviewed regarding their history of chemical exposure.\n",
      "Respondents were asked if they had ever been \"highly exposed\" at home, at work, or elsewhere to one or more of a list of chemicals or to any other such substances not on the list.\n",
      "These chemicals were categorized into 20 exposure groups based on chemical composition.\n",
      "Odds ratios were calculated adjusting for age, sex, race, education level, and geographic location by means of unconditional logistic regression.\n",
      "Increased risks were associated with reported past exposure to acid-containing chemicals, \"other caustic substances,\" aliphatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated hydrocarbons.\n",

      "Seventy-eight patients were included in a prospective study of the cardiac risk in abdominal aortic surgery.\n",
      "The Goldman risk score and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification system were applied besides several individual clinical risk factors.\n",
      "Thirty-three patients developed some kind of cardiac event, 13 of which were myocardial infarctions leading to death in six patients.\n",
      "Computer aided stepwise logistic procedure was used to determine risk factors independently correlated with these complications.\n",
      "This study showed that the Goldman risk score, angina, hypertension and renal insufficiency were significantly correlated with postoperative cardiac complications while no correlations were demonstrated with history of myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure or the ASA score system.\n",
      "A high incidence of cardiac complications (32%) was also found in the low-risk category in the Goldman score system, which indicates the need for cardiac function tests before abdominal aortic surgery.\n",

      "The usefulness of ultrarapid freezing of mouse pronucleate ova was investigated in comparison with slow, programmed freezing.\n",
      "Pronucleate mouse ova were frozen using an ultrarapid method in either 3.5 M dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), 3.5 M propanediol (PROH) or a 1:1 mixture of both.\n",
      "After a brief exposure to the cryoprotectant, they were plunged into liquid nitrogen.\n",
      "Thawing was done at 37 degrees C and the cryoprotectant was rapidly diluted in a sucrose solution.\n",
      "Pronucleate ova were slowly cooled in a biological freezer using 1.5 M PROH as cryoprotectant.\n",
      "Thawing was done at room temperature and PROH was removed by multi-step dilutions.\n",
      "As control groups, pronucleate ova were either given no treatment, or exposed to PROH or DMSO without freezing and cultured in vitro.\n",
      "Ultrarapid freezing using 3.5 M DMSO as cryoprotectant resulted in rates of survival, cleavage and post-thaw development to blastocysts of 85, 89 and 37%, respectively.\n",
      "PROH as cryoprotectant, however, was inadequate in the ultrarapid freezing protocol and the combination of DMSO and PROH showed no further improvement.\n",
      "Slow, programmed freezing (using PROH) compared to ultrarapid freezing (using DMSO) resulted in similar rates of survival, cleavage and development of 80, 84, 20% and 92, 81 and 23% respectively.\n",
      "In conclusion, DMSO is a better cryoprotectant than PROH for ultrarapid freezing of pronucleate mouse ova, and ultrarapid freezing with 3.5 M DMSO is as effective as slow freezing with 1.5 M PROH, as evaluated by their subsequent development in vitro.\n",

      "Transcription initiation from the Bacillus subtilis phage phi 29 late A3 promoter requires the viral protein p4, a transcriptional activator.\n",
      "Protein p4 binds to a region of the A3 promoter, located between nucleotides -50 and -100 relative to the transcription start site, that presents a sequence-directed curvature.\n",
      "This curvature is enhanced when protein p4 binds to the promoter.\n",
      "A number of deletion mutants at the carboxyl end of protein p4 have been constructed and their behavior as transcriptional activators of the late A3 promoter has been investigated.\n",
      "The binding of these deletion mutants to the late A3 promoter has been analyzed by gel retardation, DNase I footprinting, methylation interference and circular permutation assays.\n",
      "The results suggest that the last 12 amino acid residues of protein p4, six of which are positively charged, although not involved in the specific recognition of the promoter are responsible for part of the bend induced by protein p4 in its binding site.\n",
      "Evidence is presented which suggests that full induction of this curvature is needed for the transcription activation process.\n",
      "A model is proposed for protein p4 interaction with the A3 promoter, in which the bend is induced in two steps: first, two monomers of protein p4 bind to the inverted recognition sequences, subsequent interaction between them generating a bend between these sequences; second, the highly basic carboxyl terminus of protein p4 establishes non-specific electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone inducing a bend at both ends of the protein p4 binding region.\n",
      "The influence of the freeze-thawing rates on ATP synthetase (ATPase) complex of intact liver mitochondria was investigated.\n",
      "It was shown that the increase in latent ATPase activity and decrease in ATP synthetase activity resulted from an influence on the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n",
      "An increase in freeze-thawing rates led to the preservation of ATP synthetase activity and ATP hydrolysis reduction.\n",
      "Kinetic parameter changes of the ATP synthetase reaction resulted from an insignificant nonspecific increase in the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability and changes in its electrochemical potential level.\n",

      "Using mutagenicity in samples of urine from smokers as a model, it appeared that improved ability to detect small amounts of mutagen could be obtained by reducing volumes of media and reagents while keeping the amount of test sample constant.\n",
      "This modification resulted in a test procedure capable of readily detecting mutagenicity in volumes of urine from smokers that were smaller than the volumes of amniotic fluid available.\n",
      "Tests of amniotic fluid extracts by this modified procedure showed small increases in revertants, about 50% above dimethylsulfoxide solvent control values.\n",
      "Results of procedures to control for technical factors possibly contributing to these increases suggested that the increased values could not be readily explained by contamination of test samples with mutagens during the extraction procedure.\n",

      "These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C.

      "Treatment was well tolerated, and none of the patients experienced severe rectal or bladder complications.\n",
      "Three patients are free from disease; one patient experience local-regional recurrence based on biopsy; one recurred in the bladder, was treated with cystoprostatectomy and subsequently succumbed to metastatic disease; and one patient died of presumed metastatic disease.\n",

      "The kinetics of lymphokine RNA induction and secretion of biologically active lymphokine from CD4-enriched splenic T cell populations was investigated.\n",
      "Cells stimulated immediately after isolation from murine spleen (\"fresh\" T cells) and cells restimulated after 4 days of in vitro culture (\"primed\" T cells) were compared.\n",
      "Northern blot analysis and bioassays were used to analyze and quantitate production of eight lymphokines and the IL-2R.\n",
      "Fresh T cells produced high levels of IL-2 and low to moderate levels of IL-3, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, and IFN-gamma.\n",
      "In vitro primed T cells produced IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, IFN-gamma, and high levels of IL-2R RNA.\n",
      "Comparison of RNA levels and bioassays of supernatants from these populations indicated that primed T cells produced at least 10-fold more of six of the lymphokines than fresh T cells.\n",
      "Only IL-2 was produced in near equal amounts by fresh and primed T cells.\n",
      "There were also marked differences in the kinetics of lymphokine production by fresh and primed CD4+ T cells.\n",
      "After restimulation with Con A and PMA, primed cells produced a short burst of lymphokine RNA that peaked between 7.5 and 13 h and declined after 18 h. Fresh T cells lagged in the initial production of lymphokine RNA, with levels peaking 18 to 44 h after mitogenic stimulation.\n",
      "Depletion of CD4+ cells indicated that cells of helper phenotype were responsible for the majority of lymphokine production from the primed cells.\n",
      "Thus different subpopulations of Th cells defined by their respective ability to respond either directly (fresh T cells) or only after culture and restimulation (primed T cells) show different patterns of lymphokine gene regulation.\n",
      "Other studies suggest that the activity of \"fresh\" Th cells is due to a population with a \"memory\" phenotype, while the cells which require culture have a \"precursor\" phenotype.\n",
      "These distinct patterns of lymphokine gene regulation in the two populations of Th cells may account in part for differences seen in the kinetics and magnitude of the naive and memory immune responses which are regulated by Th cells.\n",

      "Using sophisticated computer graphics technologies and sensitive methods, our original dyslexia study of dyslexic boys delineated specific areas of the brain which in combination could constitute a \"physiological signature\" of dyslexia.\n",
      "In addition to identifying aberrant brain function in the traditional language-associated left posterior region, we also observed medial frontal lobe differences from normals, a finding confirmed by others in recent research.\n",
      "Our subsequent study sought to refine further current definitional subgroupings within the broad entity known as dyslexia-pure.\n",
      "Indeed language-based subgroups appear to have identifiable and differing topographic signatures.\n",
      "Furthermore, based on correlations between neuropsychological test scores and neurophysiological measurements, we suggest that subgroup electrophysiological differences may reflect compensatory as well as pathological brain activity.\n",
      "We believe that the currently expanding understanding of the neurophysiology of dyslexia will lead eventually to improved diagnosis and remediation of this learning disability.\n",

      "Escherichia coli murein, the polymer from which the shape-maintaining structure of the cell envelope is made, shows unexpected complexity.\n",
      "The separation of murein building blocks with high performance liquid chromatography reveals about 80 different types of muropeptides.\n",
      "Their behavior in high performance liquid chromatography and their chemical structure are described.\n",
      "The complexity of E. coli murein is due to the free combination of seven different types of side chains (L-Ala-D-Glu-R with R = -OH, -m-A2pm, -m-A2pm-D-Ala, -m-A2 pm-Gly, -m-A2pm-D-Ala-D-Ala, -m-A2pm-D-Ala-Gly, -m-A2pm-Lys-Arg) with two types of cross-bridges (D-Ala-m-A2pm, -m-A2pm-m-A2pm).\n",

      "The much favoured ovalbumin antigen induced model of arthritis in rabbits is widely used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) research.\n",
      "When examined histologically, it was found to have important deficiencies as parallels to the human disease.\n",
      "After sensitization to ovalbumin, 2 intraarticular challenge doses of a magnitude at each end of the spectrum used by investigators were used in 152 rabbits.\n",
      "The effects of the high and low dose challenges were examined histologically with particular attention to the articular cartilage.\n",
      "With high doses, the gross and histological changes in the knee joint were remarkably akin to acute cartilage necrosis rather than RA1.\n",
      "In the low dose, a milder smoldering arthritis was produced.\n",
      "These observations suggest that, depending on the challenge dose used, there is a tremendous variability in the kind of arthritis produced by the antigen induced arthritis model.\n",
      "Furthermore, it is suggested that previous conclusions about the pathophysiology and immunology of RA drawn from the models that produce a rapid and severe arthritis should be reexamined.\n",

      "The immunotoxin inhibited protein synthesis of murine erythroleukemic Ag-Eb-positive K-2 cells and completely inhibited (at the concentration of 2 X 10(-7) M) spleen colony formation by erythroleukemic stem cells of the Ag-Eb-positive RAL cell line.\n",
      "Approximately 35% of the murine normal stem-cell (CFU-S) population was not affected by the immunotoxin at the concentration of 2 X 10(-7) M. This experimental system may be a convenient model for studies of bone marrow transplantation therapy of erythroleukemias.\n",
      "The cellular mechanisms of unresponsiveness induced with a combined KCl-extracted donor antigen (HAg) and CsA regimen were dissected by limiting-dilution (LD) assay.\n",
      "While untreated Wistar-Furth (WFu, RT1u) rats reject Buffalo (BUF, RT1b) heart allografts within a mean survival time of 6.6 +/- 0.5 days, recipients treated with 3 cycles of CsA alone (-1,0,1; 7,8,9; 15,16,17) maintained BUF heart allografts up to an MST of 22.5 +/- 8.9 days.\n",
      "When CsA was combined with BUF HAg (-1), BUF heart survival was further prolonged up to an MST of 34.2 +/- 6.6 days, while third-party BN HAg was ineffective (MST of 21.5 +/- 2.1 days).\n",
      "On day 10 postgrafting, the frequency of T cytotoxic cells (fTc) within the splenic pan-T-cell population was 1:1437 +/- 301 in CsA and 1:1087 +/- 438 in CsA/HAg treated recipients.\n",
      "In contrast, on day 30 postgrafting, both CsA and CsA/HAg treated WFu rats bearing functional BUF hearts showed within their splenic pan-T-cell populations a profound decrease in fTc to 1:2966 +/- 824 with CsA alone and to 1:4946 +/- 938 with CsA/HAg treatment.\n",
      "In contrast, both untreated WFu rats who rejected BUF heart allografts and CsA-treated WFu recipients who had rejected their BUF heart allografts on day 20 displayed an increased fTc to 696 +/- 243 and to 1:1169, respectively, when examined at day 30 postgrafting.\n",
      "Additionally, both the W3/25+ and OX8+ T cell subsets specifically suppressed the proliferative response of normal WFu T cells against BUF and, to a lesser degree, third-party BN irradiated stimulators.\n",
      "Thus, CsA-treated animals develop a potent specific-suppressor mechanism that is augmented by pretreatment with donor soluble antigen.\n",

      "The metabolism and cytotoxicity of benzyl 1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobuta-1,3-dienyl sulfide (1) and benzyl 2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl sulfide (2) were studied as an alternative test of the hypothesis that the toxicity of the cysteine S-conjugates S-(pentachlorobutadienyl)-L-cysteine and S-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-L-cysteine is associated with their metabolism to unstable thiols; the expectation was that the benzyl sulfides 1 and 2 would undergo cytochrome P-450 dependent benzylic hydroxylation and that the intermediate hemimercaptals would eliminate unstable, cytotoxic thiols.\n",
      "This expectation was realized: 1 and 2 were cytotoxic in isolated rat hepatocytes.\n",
      "The cytotoxicity of 1 was greater in hepatocytes from phenobarbital-treated rats compared with control rats and in male than in female rats and was inhibited by carbon monoxide and 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl 2,2-diphenylvalerate HCl (SKF 525-A).\n",
      "Benzyl sulfides 1 and 2 were metabolized to benzaldehyde by rat hepatic microsomal fractions and by a purified, reconstituted cytochrome P-450PB-B system.\n",
      "Benzaldehyde was not cytotoxic.\n",
      "These results provide support for the hypothesis that benzyl sulfides 1 and 2 and the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates yield unstable thiols, which may give rise to acylating agents or to stable, but toxic, terminal products that are responsible for the cytotoxic effects of the benzyl sulfides and cysteine S-conjugates.\n",
      "The prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus in dogs in the Turkana District of Kenya was 39.4% of 695 examined.\n",
      "Of these, 98 (35.8%) had heavy Echinococcus worm burdens (10(3)-5 X 10(4) ), while 54 (19.7%) and 122 (44.5%) had medium (201-1000) and light (1-200) burdens.\n",
      "The possible sources of these infections are discussed.\n",
      "The prevalence rate differed in various parts of the district, ranging from 63.5% in the northwest, where the highest incidence of human hydatidosis also occurs, to nil along the shores of Lake Turkana.\n",
      "Infection rates of 32.0% and 16.7% were recorded at Lokitaung (north-east) and Lodwar (central), while in the south 48.9% of dogs harboured Echinococcus.\n",
      "This latter figure is surprising as the area has a low incidence of human hydatidosis.\n",
      "The Turkana keep a large number of dogs, and the reasons for this and the social role of the dog in the district is discussed.\n",
      "No difference in susceptibility was found between Turkana-type dogs and those of mixed breeds from Nairobi when they were experimentally infected with hydatid protoscolices from man, camels, cattle, sheep and goats.\n",
      "However, it proved difficult to infect the Turkana-type of dogs with viable protoscolices of cattle origin.\n",
      "The reasons for this and its epidemiological implications remain unclear.\n",
      "It is suggested that droughts, which affect Turkana every six to ten years, may play an important role in the perpetuation of hydatid disease in the area.\n",
      "We developed a method of refining tobacco smoke to deliver sensory components of cigarette smoking while minimizing the delivery of nicotine and other toxic smoke constituents.\n",
      "In the first experiment, smokers rated puffs of their own brands of cigarette, a commercial low tar and nicotine cigarette, and refined smoke.\n",
      "The refined smoke was rated significantly stronger and more desirable than the low tar and nicotine cigarette despite a comparably low nicotine delivery; subjects' own brands were rated best, but in standardized smoking tests delivered over ten times more tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide.\n",
      "In the second experiment, subjects smoked five times on each of two mornings; one day they received refined smoke and the other day smoked a low tar and nicotine cigarette.\n",
      "The refined smoke produced significantly more satisfaction, yet delivered far less carbon monoxide and tar (assessed by mouth intake).\n",
      "Nicotine intake was comparable to that of the low tar and nicotine cigarette.\n",
      "Because refined smoke substantially reduced subjects' craving for cigarettes while reducing nicotine intake, it may prove to be a useful short-term adjunct to a smoking cessation program.\n",
      "Additionally, the method may be useful in research analyzing the relative contributions of pharmacologic actions of inhaled smoke and the sensory cues associated with nicotine intake as reinforcers maintaining smoking behavior.\n",
      "In the Nottingham Breast Clinic 5000 new cases are seen annually; 3000 are sent because the general practitioner believes that he/she has found a lump.\n",
      "It is the diagnosis and management of this common problem that is considered in this chapter.\n",
      "The traditional management of the palpable breast lump included excision to establish accurate diagnosis; indeed up until 20 years ago even simple cysts were excised.\n",
      "Now most surgeons accept that a woman with no residual palpable abnormality after aspiration of blood-free fluid from a cyst requires no further treatment.\n",
      "Most solid breast lumps are benign on histological examination; their routine removal a mistake in judgement.\n",
      "The challenge in the management of a palpable lesion is to correctly diagnose all the cancers without having to remove those which are benign, unless the patient wishes.\n",
      "Arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) partake in the regulation of blood flow, and although it has been speculated that AVAs in the rabbit ear play a major role in the regulation of the body temperature, no documented work is available on the structural characteristics of AVAs in the rabbit ear.\n",
      "Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the frequency of AVAs and their structural characteristics by using the vascular corrosive resin casts and further examination under a scanning electron microscope (SEM).\n",
      "This method permitted not only the visualization of a three-dimensional view of AVAs, but also depicted a clear differentiation between AVAs and arterioles or venules.\n",
      "Within the vascular architecture of rabbit ear, three distinctive vascular layers could be identified.\n",
      "The frontal and dorsal epithelial vascular layers are distributed underneath the epithelium and formed with nearly all capillaries, and the intermediate vascular layer which is established with main arteries, veins and their branches.\n",
      "The AVAs were observed in all three vascular layers, although various venous valves were concentrated primarily in the intermediate vascular layer.\n",
      "In tabulating the frequency of appearance of AVAs, the mean number was 81.5 per centimeter square.\n",
      "The mean number of AVAs in each of the three vascular layers was 31.1 in the frontal layer, 17.1 in the intermediate layer and 33.1 in dorsal layer, respectively.\n",
      "The vasculature of rabbit ear was further anatomically divided into tip, middle and root portions.\n",
      "The mean number of AVAs in each portion, from the tip to the root was 112.9, 49.4 and 84.4, respectively.\n",
      "Several essential types of AVAs were observed, such as the S-shaped and similar forms which were the predominate type.\n",
      "Others observed were U-shaped, straight, Y-shaped and tri-branching types.\n",
      "Most AVAs within the intermediate vascular layer, consisting of a few small vessels which were mainly capillaries and venules, connected to the anastomosing portion of AVA.\n",
      "The high occurrence and strategic location of AVAs in the rabbit ear strongly suggest that AVAs in the rabbit ear partake in thermal regulation.\n",
      "The effect of early myocardial reperfusion (within 4 hours after onset of symptoms) on regional left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction has been quantitated by analysis of segmental wall motion.\n",
      "Of 533 patients randomized either to conventional coronary care unit therapy or to a reperfusion strategy, in 332 high quality angiograms were obtained 2 to 8 weeks after the onset of myocardial infarction.\n",
      "In those assigned to thrombolytic therapy, angiographic data were also available after acute reperfusion.\n",
      "Analysis on an \"intention to treat\" basis revealed significant preservation of left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy (ejection fraction 53%) compared with conventional treatment (ejection fraction 47%).\n",
      "In addition, wall motion analysis showed significant improvement of regional function in the infarct zone in both inferior and anterior infarction.\n",
      "In addition, significant changes occurred in regional function of the remote \"noninfarct zone\" in the acute as well as the chronic stage.\n",
      "It is concluded that improved regional and global left ventricular function can be achieved with early reperfusion and that this is the likely explanation for the reduction of early and late mortality after thrombolysis observed in this study.\n",
      "We prospectively studied 535 newborn infants who had been monitored during labour with scalp electrodes.\n",

      "We find that OCD is characterized by a focal anxiety point(s) reflected in obsessions and by behavioral or cognitive compulsions.\n",
      "The appearance of these characteristics in other disorders suggests some relation between them and, consequently, the treatment of these disorders may be enhanced by conceptualizing them as OCD \"variants\".\n",
      "Presistent infections with rubella virus were established in baby hamster kidney, BSC-1, HeLa, RK-13, rabbit embryo chondrocyte, and Vero cell lines.\n",
      "All of the cultures except Vero continually produced rubella virus and interferon to which the virus was sensitive.\n",
      "Concurrently, only the Vero cells did not display interference against superinfection with Newcastle disease and vesicular stomatitis viruses.\n",
      "The addition of 1,000 U of exogenous interferon to the cultures cured only the rabbit embryo and Vero cells of the persistent infection.\n",
      "That the interferon is not required for the initiation and maintenance of rubella viral persistence in vitro is implied by the following.\n",
      "(1) Vero cells were persistently infected in the absence of interferon; (2) actinomycin D or cortisone inhibited interferon synthesis but not the rubella viral infection; and (3) cells continuously cultured in the presence of cortisone maintained a viral persistence without interferon synthesis.\n",
      "On the other hand, interferon seems to be responsible for the viral interference; Vero cells infected with rubella virus and cultures inoculated with rubella virus in the presence of actinomycin D or cortisone did not display interference against Newcastle disease or vesicular stomatitis viruses.\n",
      "Purification of progenitor toxin of Clostridium botulinum type B strain Okra was undertaken by sequential steps of acid precipitation, extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, ribonuclease digestion, acid precipitation, protamine treatment, sulphopropyl-Sephadex chromatography, and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration.\n",

      "In order to encourage the implementation of tobacco consumption reduction programmes, the number of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases and chief cancer localizations attributable to tobacco consumption in Spain were calculated by epidemiologic methods.\n",
      "Estimates suggest that, in 1983, 39.816 tobacco related deaths occurred, which accounted for 13% of total deaths reported during that year.\n",
      "The four tobacco related diseases producing the greatest number of deaths were ischemic cardiopathy (10.821 deaths), bronchopulmonary cancer (8.337 deaths), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.473 deaths), and acute cerebrovascular accident (6.636 deaths).\n",
      "These results suggest that tobacco consumption is the isolated cause responsible of the greatest number of deaths in Spain, whose control must become a priority objective in our health policy.\n",
      "Beta electrocorticographic rhythms (30-45 Hz) develop during focused immobile attention within two distinct foci in cats.\n",
      "A multiple electrode exploration was performed, followed by post-mortem histological analysis, to determine the precise localization of these foci.\n",
      "Electrode tips recording beta rhythms in the waking attentive cat were located: in motor areas (Brodmann's areas 4 and 6), in a band extending from the postcruciate cortex to the walls of the presylvian sulcus, crossing the frontal pole (anterior beta focus); in the posterior parietal associative area 5a, along the divisions of the ansate sulcus (posterior beta focus).\n",
      "The two foci are separated by somatic areas 3, 2 and 1, where beta rhythms were never recorded.\n",
      "The location of the posterior focus may suggest that area 5 is, in the cat as it is in the monkey, involved in motor control.\n",
      "Surgical techniques for male reconstruction of ambiguous genitalia are the same used for treatment of severe hypospadias, preceded, if necessary, by hormonal stimulation for penile growth.\n",

      "Transfused patients exhibited a more rapid onset and steeper increase of prostanoid production.\n",
      "After 24 hours incubation, the spontaneous and LPS-induced PGE release of pre- and post-BT cells was significantly different (pre-BT: 2.1 and 5.1 ng/ml; post-3-BT: 5.0 and 7.9 ng/ml; p less than 0.01).\n",
      "Pre-BT cells released considerably lower amounts of TXB2 than post-BT cells (spontaneous release: 39 vs 88 ng/ml; LPS-induced release: 62 ng/ml vs 129 ng/ml; p less than 0.05).\n",
      "After correction for monocytes as defined by monoclonal antibodies, post-BT cells again showed increased prostanoid release as compared to pre-BT cells.\n",
      "Therefore, the enhanced PGE and TXB2 release of post-BT cells is not caused by an increase merely in the number of monocytes.\n",
      "Rather, BT appear to induce an enhanced release of prostanoids by activation of monocytes.\n",
      "We also found a correlation between the number of BT and the amount of prostanoid release.\n",
      "Immunological methods have always represented a major contribution to the diagnosis of infectious diseases.\n",
      "Recent technical advances in immunochemistry make this contribution even more essential than in the past.\n",
      "The author reviews the classic principles of immunological diagnosis in infectious pathology.\n",
      "In the best cases, this diagnosis is based on parasite identification (in the broad sense), or identification of specific products from the parasite.\n",
      "It is also possible to consider shortening culture time, when necessary, by performing an early immunological identification.\n",
      "The most recent developments in this field are presented.\n",
      "When the identification of the parasite or its secretion products is not feasible, one must be content to demonstrate the occurrence of a specific immune response, essentially of humoral nature.\n",
      "The author reminds of the basic theoretical difficulties preventing a real analytic antibody titration.\n",
      "The importance of the expression of the results as well as the predictive value of the tests, is stressed.\n",
      "Finally, the author analyzes some of the recent advances such as the development of immuno-enzymatic techniques, rapid testing which can be performed by non-biologists, the contribution of monoclonal antibodies and the possibility of using them in a new detection diagram of antibodies.\n",
      "The author reminds of the difficulty in the standardization of immunological methods, especially the determination of antibodies.\n",
      "Atherosclerosis and its consequences are a significant cause of death in industrialized countries.\n",

      "In this study these genetic markers, in particular those found at the level of the genes of apolipoproteins, are reviewed.\n",
      "The knowledge of these facts is important for the paediatrician, since these disturbances can be identified in the first days of an individual's life, thus a positive influence can be made over the lifestyle habits.\n",
      "The disposition of free and of total tryptophan following an intravenous load of 1.5 g of L-tryptophan was evaluated in eight patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease, 40 patients with cirrhosis of the liver (21 Child's A, 15 Child's B, 4 Child's C) and in 14 healthy subjects.\n",
      "Cirrhosis affected disposition of tryptophan by (a) decreasing the clearance of both free and total tryptophan by 64% (P less than 0.001) and 34% (P less than 0.01), respectively, (b) by increasing the apparent volume of distribution of total tryptophan by 42% (P less than 0.01) by expansion of the peripheral compartment, resulting in (c) a threefold increase in the half-life of tryptophan.\n",
      "Apart from a reduction in free tryptophan clearance, these changes in tryptophan disposition were not apparent in patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease.\n",
      "Elevated fasting free tryptophan plasma concentrations are an indicator of impaired tryptophan metabolism in cirrhosis.\n",
      "They result from a decreased hepatic clearance of tryptophan rather than from a reduction in tryptophan protein binding.\n",
      "This study emphasises the markedly differing pharmacokinetic behaviour of tryptophan in cirrhotic patients compared with normal subjects and with patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease.\n",
      "The liver contains two types of galactose receptors, specific for Kupffer and parenchymal cells respectively.\n",
      "These receptors are only expressed in the liver, and therefore are attractive targets for the specific delivery of drugs.\n",
      "We provided low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a particle with a diameter of 23 nm in which a variety of drugs can be incorporated, with terminal galactose residues by lactosylation.\n",
      "Radioiodinated LDL, lactosylated to various extents (60-400 mol of lactose/ mol of LDL), was injected into rats.\n",
      "The plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of radioactivity were correlated with the extent of lactosylation.\n",
      "Highly lactosylated LDL (greater than 300 lactose/LDL) is completely cleared from the blood by liver within 10 min.\n",
      "Pre-injection with N-acetylgalactosamine blocks liver uptake, which indicates that the hepatic recognition sites are galactose-specific.\n",
      "The hepatic uptake occurs mainly by parenchymal and Kupffer cells.\n",
      "At a low degree of lactosylation, approx.\n",
      "60 lactose/LDL, the specific uptake (ng/mg of cell protein) is 28 times higher in Kupffer cells than in parenchymal cells.\n",
      "However, because of their much larger mass, parenchymal cells are the main site of uptake.\n",
      "At high degrees of lactosylation (greater than 300 lactose/LDL), the specific uptake in Kupffer cells is 70-95 times that in parenchymal cells.\n",
      "Under these conditions, Kupffer cells are, despite their much smaller mass, the main site of uptake.\n",
      "Thus not only the size but also the surface density of galactose on lactosylated LDL is important for the balance of uptake between Kupffer and parenchymal cells.\n",
      "This knowledge should allow us to design particulate galactose-bearing carriers for the rapid transport of various drugs to either parenchymal cells or Kupffer cells.\n",
      "Some diseases of the larynx that now are rare were common in 1950, when the author began the practice of pediatric otolaryngology.\n",

      "In isolated rat hepatocytes: phosphorylase activation by the ionophore A23187 was enhanced in the presence of tumour-promoting phorbol esters and 1,2- (but not 1,3-) diacylglycerols (dioleoyl- and oleoylacetyl-glycerol), with a similar dose-dependency; the activation of phosphorylase by phenylephrine (1 microM) (but not by vasopressin or glucagon) was inhibited both by tumour-promoting phorbol esters and diacylglycerols, but with a different dose-dependency: complete inhibition was achieved with concentrations of phorbol esters two orders of magnitude lower than those of diacylglycerol; binding of the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist [3H]prazosin and its displacement by unlabelled prazosin was not significantly affected in the presence of the phorbol esters.\n",

      "ALS with less severe bulbar disorder demonstrated mixed hyperintensity and normointensity areas in the tongue.\n",
      "ALS without lingual symptoms showed increased intensity of tongue which suggested subclinical involvement of lingual muscle.\n",
      "BSMA case also showed atrophic tongue with diffusely increased signal intensity.\n",
      "SDS case with sleep apnea was revealed to have round shaped tongue without increased signal intensity, but his tongue fell into the posterior oral cavity, indicating hypotonus of genioglossus muscle.\n",
      "We concluded that MRI of the tongue is useful to determine the bulbar symptoms due to lower neuron disorder or not.\n",
      "Measurements of total body potassium (T.B.K.)\n",

      "The GH4C1 pituitary cell line contains specific plasma membrane receptors for the inhibitory neuropeptide somatostatin (SRIF).\n",
      "Unlike other peptides which bind to cell surface receptors on these cells, SRIF is not rapidly internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n",
      "Here we examined the effects of chronic SRIF pretreatment on the subsequent ability of GH4C1 cells to bind and respond to this hormone.\n",
      "Treatment of cells with 100 nM SRIF increased [125I-Tyr1]SRIF binding to a maximum value of 220% of control after 20 h. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the number, but not the affinity, of the receptors was altered.\n",
      "The effect of SRIF was dose-dependent (ED50 = 2.3 +/- 0.4 nM), was not mimicked by an inactive analog, and was specific for the SRIF receptor.\n",
      "Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with other agents, which mimic SRIF's action to decrease intracellular cAMP and free Ca2+ concentrations, did not mimic the SRIF-induced increase in receptor number.\n",
      "Thus, occupancy of the SRIF receptor was required for SRIF receptor up-regulation.\n",
      "Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not prevent the SRIF-induced increase in receptors, consistent with an effect of SRIF to either reduce receptor degradation or cause slow redistribution of preexisting receptors to the plasma membrane.\n",
      "In contrast to the effects on receptor binding, pretreating cells with SRIF did not alter either basal cAMP levels or the potency of SRIF to inhibit cAMP accumulation (ED50 = 0.5 +/- 0.2 nM).\n",
      "However, the maximum cAMP produced by stimulators of adenylyl cyclase was increased.\n",
      "The observation that chronic SRIF exposure did not cause homologous desensitization in GH4C1 cells and increased rather than decreased SRIF receptor number is consistent with the fact that this neuropeptide is not rapidly internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n",
      "A case of gastric rupture is described in a patient who was wearing a lap and diagonal inertia reel seat belt at the time of a head-on collision.\n",

      "In order to clarify the effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP) on postprandial hypotension (PPH) in patients with multiple system atrophy, a loading test of 75 g glucose in 225 ml water was performed during infusion of AVP (0.3 U/min).\n",
      "AVP (0.3 U/min) infusion prior to the loading was significantly effective for PPH in all patients: PPH following to oral intake of glucose was completely prevented.\n",
      "We conclude that infusion of AVP maintained circulating systemic blood volumes by reduced portal venous flow (after a reduction of portal venous inflow) as a result of vasoconstrictive effect of AVP on the splanchnic vessels in patients with PPH.\n",
      "Electroneural response patterns of single auditory-nerve neurons were studied in aminoglycoside-deafened squirrel monkeys.\n",
      "The electrical stimuli were delivered through bipolar electrodes implanted in the scala tympani.\n",
      "The effects of pulse width, shape, frequency, and intensity on neural adaptation, phase locking, and spectral content were evaluated.\n",
      "Our results did not demonstrate the characteristic adaptation seen in auditory-nerve neurons in response to acoustic stimulation.\n",
      "Phase locking to a broad stimulus pulse (3200 microseconds/phase) was found to a very restricted phase angle of the electrical stimulus which was broader for square wave than for sine wave stimulation.\n",
      "The latency of the phase locked response varied inversely with stimulus intensity with greater variation for square wave stimulation than for sine wave stimulation.\n",
      "Auditory neurons were capable of a very high degree of phase locking to a 200-microseconds/phase pulse presented at 156 pulses per second (PPS) and to the first pulse of a 2500-Hz pulse burst.\n",
      "Phase locking was much poorer for the subsequent 200-microseconds/phase pulses comprising the 2500-Hz pulse burst where the neuron's response was determined by its relative recovery status.\n",
      "These findings can be explained by an interaction between the neuron's relative refractory status and its integration of charge over the stimulatory half cycle of the electrical stimulus.\n",
      "These two factors also appear to determine the interspike interval of the neural response.\n",
      "This interval decreased monotonically with increasing stimulus intensity.\n",
      "The neural spike rate (150-500 Hz) producing this interval increased with intensity and may be a source of periodicity information which the central auditory nervous system could interpret as pitch.\n",
      "This may account for the proportional relationship between pitch and stimulus intensity seen in some cochlear implant patients.\n",
      "Our study demonstrates that auditory-nerve neurons comply with basic neurophysiological principles in their responses to electrical stimulation.\n",
      "These principles should be incorporated into the cochlear prosthesis stimulator if more normal neural response patterns are desired in the cochlear prosthesis patient.\n",
      "Using the Analytab (API 20E) Enterobacteriaceae system of biochemical identification, a total of 506 Escherichia coli isolates from different animal species were coded numerically or biotyped.\n",
      "Fifty-four different biotypes were identified, 11 accounting for 83.1% of the isolates examined.\n",
      "Three of these profiles accounted for 65.3% of the isolates and were found in almost all animal species.\n",
      "Some of the biotypes were found in only one animal species: six in cattle, five in horses, 15 in pigs, two in sheep, two in birds, one in dogs and one in a porpoise.\n",
      "Biotypes, as determined here, could not be related to a particular pathology and more work is needed to assess the extent and significance of this relative biotype specificity among animal species.\n",
      "The use of other, more sophisticated, typing systems, i.e.\n",
      "plasmid \"fingerprinting\", or restriction endonuclease analysis of chromosomal DNA, would have to be investigated.\n",
      "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed, and in 1979 almost 10% of the adult population was taking them.\n",
      "Prior studies of outpatient usage of benzodiazepines have relied on survey or prescription data, which may be confounded by noncompliance.\n",
      "To determine the actual use of benzodiazepines, plasma benzodiazepine concentrations were measured in 225 consecutive outpatients from a university cardiology outpatient service.\n",
      "Self reports indicated that the great majority of the patients (191) were taking at least one medicine, and 70 reported being on a psychotropic drug.\n",
      "Seventy-seven patients reported taking benzodiazepines, the majority being on bromazepam (20), diazepam (26) or oxazepam (19).\n",
      "In 25 of those 77 patients, the reported drug could not be detected in plasma.\n",
      "Conversely, in 10 of the 225 patients, benzodiazepines which were not reported were detected (diazepam or flurazepam).\n",
      "Of those taking benzodiazepines, many had a low concentration, suggesting intermittent rather than regular use.\n",
      "Thus, many patients for whom benzodiazepines are prescribed take them irregularly, and a small group uses them without reporting their prescription.\n",
      "These findings have implications for the clinical presentation of illness and for the possibility of drug interactions.\n",
      "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors from the avian central nervous system were examined for developmental changes that correlated with the differentiation of cholinergic synapses.\n",
      "In contrast to previous studies that showed a single molecular weight form of muscarinic receptors in the mature central nervous system, the current study of receptors from embryonic and newly hatched chick retina showed the presence of two electrophoretic forms having apparent molecular weights of 86,200 +/- 400 and 72,200 +/- 300.\n",
      "Two receptor forms also were observed in embryonic cerebrum, optic tectum, and cerebellum.\n",
      "Each form was present, although decreased in molecular weight by 6000, after treatment with deglycosylating enzymes, consistent with molecular differences occurring in the protein portions, rather than the carbohydrate portions, of the molecules.\n",
      "The relative proportions of the high and low molecular weight receptors in retina showed a striking inversion during development.\n",
      "Before synaptogenesis, receptors were mainly of Mr 86,000, whereas after synaptogenesis, receptors were mainly of Mr 72,000.\n",
      "Development of a predominantly low molecular weight receptor population also occurred in aggregate, but not monolayer, cell culture, suggesting a possible role for cell-cell interactions in triggering the change.\n",
      "Pulse-chase labeling of receptors on cultured cells indicated that both forms were present on the cell surface; the labeled Mr 86,000 population had a half-life of 5 hr, whereas the labeled Mr 72,000 population had a half-life of 19 hr.\n",
      "The change in size of muscarinic receptors during development may reflect the action of regulatory mechanisms critical to the proper assembly and function of synapses in the central nervous system.\n",

      "Victims of severe injuries frequently pass haemoglobin, myoglobin, or both proteins in their urine.\n",
      "If the kidneys of such persons are to be considered as donor material for transplantation, a pathology department may be requested to identify which of these pigments is present.\n",
      "If freshly passed urine is available, haemoglobinuria in the absence of myoglobinuria may be rapidly identified by spectroscopy.\n",
      "However, the rapid degradation of myoglobin to the met-myoglobin form will make spectroscopic recognition of this pigment in the urine unreliable.\n",
      "In the absence of variant haemoglobins, myoglobin may be easily distinguished from normal haemoglobin by routine electrophoresis on paper, starch gel, or cellulose acetate at alkaline pH.\n",
      "The electrophoretic method of choice in the presence of variant haemoglobins utilizes polyacrylamide gel at 12 g/100 ml as a supporting medium.\n",
