Disturbance in time experience may contribute towards an understanding of diurnal variation in depressive symptomatology. To examine this hypothesis a series of time estimation experiments was conducted in the course of the day. Twenty-five endogenous depressive patients (according to ICD-9) and 12 healthy controls were asked to estimate prospectively a 30-s interval on two successive days at 7.30 a.m., 11.30 a.m., 3.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. Simultaneously the subjects assessed their state of well-being using a visual analogue mood scale. A circadian rhythm of time estimation errors could not be detected; even in daily courses with 'typical' diurnal variations an increasingly favourable self-assessment of well-being was not accompanied by a corresponding diurnal fluctuation of time estimation. These results cast additional doubts on the significance of 'typical' diurnal variations in depressive symptomatology.", "PMC2447536": "Release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscle is not sensitive to organic Ca2+ channel blockers. However, in mouse motor nerve endings, extracellular recording reveals that a verapamil-sensitive Ca2+ current can be induced after block of K+ channels. Recordings of extracellular action potentials from inside the perineural sheaths of nerves innervating mouse triangularis sterni muscles reveal that this verapamil-sensitive current is not blocked by omega-conotoxin, and hence, it does not involve channels similar to the L-channels of neuronal cell bodies.", "PMC2644305": "Significant spinal abnormalities were found in eight patients (average age of 6 years, 5 months) with camptomelic dysplasia. The late ossification of the midthoracic pedicles served as a clear diagnostic criterion for the syndrome. Scoliosis averaging 63 degrees was found in all seven nonquadriplegic cases. Thoracic hyperkyphosis averaging 126 degrees was seen in six (75%) of the patients, while cervical kyphosis averaging 66 degrees was noted in three (38%). Vertebral body hypoplasia appeared to be a major cause of deformity. This study clarifies that patients with camptomelic dysplasia are surviving longer than previously expected and therefore should have their spinal deformities treated aggressively.", "PMC3695081": "Platelet function was studied in patients with diverse clinical patterns of unstable angina. In vasospastic angina, anginal attacks coincide with the highest increment in Ca2+ of platelets, and their high sensitivity to aggregation inductors, which declines as the condition stabilizes. Unstable angina without the vasospastic component is associated with reduced platelet sensitivity to aggregation inductors, particularly so in patients showing signs of intracoronary thrombosis. Spontaneous anginal attacks are accompanied with a rise of thromboxane B2 and a drop in the stable prostacyclin metabolite level.", "PMC2715224": "The main steps to be carried out in the operation of vaginal hysterectomy when the uterus is not prolapsed are overall the same as when vaginal hysterectomy is carried out for prolapse: separation of the bladder from the uterus, opening of the Pouch of Douglas, dividing the utero-sacral ligaments, opening the vesico-uterine pouch, dividing the cardinal ligaments, delivering the fundus of the uterus, freeing the uterine cornua and reperitonealisation. All the same, for each step there are numerous different details to be carried out. Careful attention to all these modifications make it easier to remove a non mobile uterus or one that is markedly enlarged. When the definite advantages of this technique, which is unfortunately insufficiently practised in France, are understood it is the operation of choice rather than the abdominal approach whenever a vaginal approach is possible, which it is in the large majority of cases.", "PMC2481281": "This article describes the inadvertent, catheter-induced induction of right bundle branch block resulting not only in transient complete infra-His heart block but also in temporary interruption of the macroreentry circuit of ventricular tachycardia. A patient with preexistent left bundle branch block and spontaneous ventricular tachycardia based upon the bundle branch reentry mechanism underwent electrophysiological testing for the evaluation of sotalol drug efficacy. In search of an optimal His-bundle recording, the manipulation of a 6 Fr quadripolar catheter caused a right bundle branch block, thus advancing the preexistent left bundle branch block to complete heart block. Retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction remained unaffected. The macroreentrant tachycardia with left bundle branch block configuration was no longer inducible. While the patient continued on unchanged sotalol medication (320 mg/d) he required temporary pacing for 16 hours until the block subsided. A subsequent induction attempt demonstrated initiation of the tachycardia. Finally, guided by invasive testing, the patient successfully received amiodarone therapy (300 mg/d). The patient completed an uneventful follow up of 27 months. No progression of conduction delay was observed. This case suggests that the inadvertent induction of right bundle branch block prevents the initiation of ventricular tachycardias relying on bundle branch reentry. Therefore, missed diagnosis or misinterpretation of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy might occur if there is no electrophysiological reevaluation after right bundle branch recovery.", "PMC4014125": "In the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, 158,906 individuals from 14 communities around the United States had their blood pressure measured in their homes in 1972-1973. Of the total population screened, 2.4% had isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg). Isolated systolic hypertension was present for 0.5% of those aged 30-39 years and 6.8% among those aged 60-69 years. The prevalence in blacks and women was greater than the prevalences in both whites and men. The prevalence among those taking antihypertensive medications at the time of screening was 6.1%, and 1.9% among those not on antihypertensive medications. From the individuals with \"normal\" diastolic blood pressure on the single home measurement (less than 90 mmHg), a random sample of 5,032 individuals were followed for mortality for eight years. Prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension was similar in this sample to that in the total. Among those not on antihypertensive medications, 8-year life table all-cause mortality rates adjusted for age, race, and sex were 17.6% for those with systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mmHg and 7.7% for those with systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg. Among this population, all of whom had a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, a multiple logistic analysis adjusting for baseline treatment status, age, race, sex, education, smoking, weight, pulse, physical activity, and systolic blood pressure revealed that each millimeter increase in systolic blood pressure was associated with approximately a 1% increase in mortality over the eight years of follow-up (p less than 0.05).

Mitigation of HPO toxicity for P. aeruginosa by nutrients present at the burn site could explain the lack of in vivo success. Alternatively, HPO-induced depression of host defense mechanisms could negate beneficial effects arising from HPOs known toxicity for P. aeruginosa. Accordingly, mouse peritoneal exudate cells (PEC), preincubated for 24 h in 1 atm of air-CO(2), were used to study the in vitro effects of HPO or air-CO(2) on phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa or sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). Subsequent 2-h exposures of PEC to increasing numbers of bacteria, in an air-CO(2) atmosphere, decreased the percentage of bacteria cleared as well as PEC viability. Similar exposures of PEC to bacteria in an HPO atmosphere prevented the loss of PEC viability and increased bacterial clearance. In control experiments, increasing the number of SRBC relative to PEC decreased the percentage of SRBC cleared without decreasing PEC viability, as determined under air-CO(2); short (2 h) exposure to HPO did not affect SRBC clearance. Microscopic examination of PEC indicated that a 24-h preincubation in HPO decreased the percentage of PEC which could ingest SRBC during subsequent experimental exposures (2 h) to air-CO(2) or HPO. These data suggest that short periods of exposure to HPO promote the ability of PEC to clear pseudomonads by adversely affecting the bacteria. This in turn prevents a pseudomonad-induced depression of PEC viability and function. In contrast, prolonged HPO exposure may be detrimental to phagocytic activity.", "PMC4007151": "Two new pyridazinone derivatives were selected among two series and assayed for their hemodynamic effects.

The extent of the blood vessel lesion was evaluated by using transparent chamber placed in the mouse skin. Bleeding, hyperemia and congestion were observed at 1-2h, 4-6h and 24h after TNF (1 X 10(4)U/mouse) administration, respectively. In contrast, no histological changes in the normal blood vessels were observed microscopically following TNF injection. Thrombus formation was evoked in the tumor vessels 4h after TNF injection. However, when thrombus formation was prevented by heparin, no difference was observed among antitumor action of TNF against Meth-A fibrosarcoma necrotic response and the rate of complete cure.

The 41 (40%) mothers who decided against subsequent pregnancy were significantly older than the remaining mothers. Mothers were also significantly more likely to decide against subsequent pregnancy if their ELBW infant had survived. The outcome of subsequent pregnancies within 3 years of the ELBW birth was ascertained; 28% ended in miscarriage, 3% in stillbirth, 1% in neonatal death, 21% in a surviving preterm infant and 51% in a survivor born at term. Mothers diagnosed to have cervical incompetence had a significantly higher risk of a subsequent preterm birth. During the study period, 87% of mothers who became pregnant subsequent to their ELBW infant gave birth to at least one surviving child. Of the subsequent livebirths, 36% were less than 2,500g, 11% were less than 1,500g and 5% were less than 1,000g.

The methods were biological (urine) monitoring, industrial hygiene assessment and a questionnaire related to worker-perceived health effects. Approximately 40 workers exposed to the wood preservative and 40 unexposed controls working in other locations of the plant participated in the study. Evaluation of work conditions, assessment of urinary levels of tetra- and pentachlorophenol, and administration of a medical questionnaire were performed at a six-month intervals over a two-year period. Industrial hygiene ratings of exposures and adequacy of protection were evaluated in relation to the results of biological monitoring. Workers who came into contact with freshly treated and still wet wood had consistently higher urinary levels of tetrachlorophenol. Workers stationed adjacent to the spray applicator also had higher tetrachlorophenol levels. There was no statistically significant relationship between the subjective ratings by the industrial hygienist of exposure and adequacy of worker protection with the urinary levels of tetrachlorophenol. Nor was there a consistent pattern linking exposure ratings with adequacy of protection. The short half-life of tetrachlorophenol in the urine makes this a good indicator of only the most recent exposure. The differences in urinary levels between controls and exposed workers were large, with averages of 240.4 ppb for exposed workers and 14.6 for controls. Traditional industrial hygiene evaluation techniques, in conjunction with biological monitoring, proved to be the most effective method of assessing both exposure and work practices. Exposed workers reported a statistically significant increase of positive answers to known signs and symptoms of chlorophenol exposure compared with the controls. There was no statistically significant relationship between the number of these health problems reported and the mean urinary levels of tetra- or pentachlorophenol for the exposed group; however, for certain variables (heavy vs. light exposure, inadequate vs. adequate protection, greater than 100 ppb urinary tetrachlorophenol vs. less than 100 ppb), those with heavier exposure, inadequate protection or higher urinary tetrachlorophenol reported on the average more health problems over the two-year period. Firm statistical conclusions could not be drawn because of the small size of the study population.", "PMC2938055": "Recent studies of the effects of endorphins and other neuropeptides on immune mechanisms suggest that immune reactive cells have specific opioid-like and nonopioid endorphin receptors, and indicate that neuropeptides may participate in regulating in vivo immune functions. Earlier demonstrations of impaired cellular immunity and impaired lymphokine production in patients with cancer of the head and neck prompted an investigation of the in vitro effects of beta-endorphin on the production of leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LIF) in 29 patients with head and neck cancer and in 45 normal subjects. LIF production in response to phytohemagglutinin was significantly less in the cancer patients compared to normal subjects (p less than .001). beta-endorphin significantly enhanced LIF production in the cancer patients (p = .01) to levels that did not differ significantly from normal levels. A correlation of levels of lymphocyte subpopulations in the cancer patients suggested that enhancement of lymphokine production by beta-endorphin was related to levels of T8 (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells. The results confirm earlier demonstrations of impaired lymphokine production in patients with head and neck cancer and indicate that beta-endorphin can modulate in vitro lymphokine responses in such patients. These findings suggest that neuroendocrine peptides may play an important role in regulating immune function. Further study of the role of neuropeptides in the immune response should provide additional insight into the characterization of cellular immune dysfunction associated with head and neck cancer and should lead to the development of innovative immunotherapeutic treatment strategies.", "PMC1885966": "This article describes how Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) students are introduced to the concept of community as client.

The antibodies were of the IgG1 kappa, and IgG2b-kappa isotypes. The binding of both antibodies to GHRH-coated plates was inhibited by a 30-44 amino acid fragment but not by a 1-26 fragment. Thus, both antibodies are directed against the carboxy terminus of the peptide. Furthermore, both antibodies bind to the same epitope on the 30-44 amino acid portion since they cross-inhibit each other's binding to intact GHRH. Using these mAbs, a direct binding GHRH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed which had a least detectable dose of 30 pg. The availability of these antibodies and their use in ELISA methodology permits consistent and specific detection of GHRH in a non-isotope assay.

On three test days-one, 45, and 90-mean peak responses for forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity and mean area under the time-response curve were higher for ipratropium than for metaproterenol. Clinical improvement was noted in both treatment groups, especially during the first treatment month, with persistence of improvement throughout the remainder of the study.

Loosely or firmly attached at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, and 11 larger tumors were smooth-surfaced, discrete, pale brown, globoid masses that varied from 2.5 to 16 mm in diameter. Four tumors of microscopic size occurred in otherwise normal-looking carotid bodies. All were composed of densely packed polygonal cells disposed in sheets and cords or arranged in clusters by a reticulin meshwork rich in blood vessels. Always unilateral, the tumors had not invaded locally or metastasized. As seen in the smallest tumors, the neoplastic cells usually arose centrally in the carotid body and formed an expansive growth that replaced much of the normal parenchyma without necessarily enlarging the organ beyond normal limits. The cause of the tumors was not apparent.

The neurohypophysis was also examined in normal rats and rats that had been water-deprived for 72 h. The rats were fixed through chronically implanted catheters, so that at the time of fixation the animal was uninfluenced by anaesthesia and surgery. Water load increased the density of the neurosecretory granules in the endings in the zone nearest the basal lamina of the pericapillary space. The interpretation of this is that water load fills up the readily releasable pool of the neurosecretory granules.

A total of 64 adult New Zealand white rabbits were used. NE cardiomyopathy was produced in rabbits by a 90-minute intravenous infusion of norepinephrine (2 micrograms/kg/min at infusion rate 0.382 ml/min). Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were constantly monitored. Arterial blood samples were obtained at 30-minute intervals for measurements of pH, blood gases, and glucose. Alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents, when employed, were given 15 minutes prior to the initiation of NE infusion. Two days after treatment the rabbits were killed. The hearts were examined microscopically and assigned a histologic score. Pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin at 50, 100, or 200 micrograms/kg significantly reduced NE-induced myocardial injury in a dose-related manner. In contrast, the presence of alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocker yohimbine at 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg was ineffective in preventing the formation of myocardial lesions.

Knowledge of N-B type has been useful in predicting Fv-1 sensitivity.", "PMC3012696": "In cases of syringomyelia MR is superior to CT and myelography in visualisation and delineation of the extent of the process. In diagnosing spinal tumours MR is a more sensitive method than CT and myelography. MR provides additional information on sagittal and frontal planes regarding the extent of the tumour. In diagnosis of disc prolapse MR seems to be as accurate as CT or myelography. We obtained additional information in diagnosis of degenerated disc tissue. Spinal stenosis is easily recognisable. CT was superior in differentiation of bony and disc protrusion. The results show that MR has opened up new possibilities in the diagnosis of spinal diseases and will result in a reorientation of the diagnostic approach.", "PMC3977583": "Dyadic adjustment, sexual activities, and marital stability in the relationships of female-to-male transsexuals and their spouses were examined. Participants were 22 female-to-male transsexuals who had undergone some form of surgery to alter their anatomical sex, their spouses, and a control group of married or cohabitating nontranssexual men and women. Participants were administered the Dyadic Adjustment Scale and additional items to assess quantitatively their marital relationships. The transsexuals and their spouses were also asked open-ended interview questions concerning marital and life adjustments. Generally, the transsexuals and their spouses reported good and mutually satisfying interpersonal relationships that are in many ways comparable to those of the matched control group. These findings lend support to the previous clinical interview studies that have reported that female-to-male transsexuals form stable and enduring intimate relationships.", "PMC3134778": "In order to test the reactivity of TSH to TRH during amiodarone treatment we investigated 7 hypothyroid subjects treated with 50 micrograms T3/day. A TRH test (200 micrograms iv) was performed before and after 6 weeks of treatment with 400 mg amiodarone/day. Amiodarone treatment induced a significant increase in serum total and free T3 (from 2.17 +/- 0.13 to 3.55 +/- 0.58 nmol/l and from 5.6 +/- 0.61 to 9.46 +/- 1.41 pmol/l). Basal TSH levels were significantly decreased and the maximal stimulation of TSH 20 min after TRH injection was only 20.0 +/- 3.3 mU/l during amiodarone treatment compared with 61.4 +/- 10.4 mU/l before treatment. These results indicate that in hypothyroid patients treated with amiodarone, the TSH response to TRH is blunted and that this is likely to be related to the higher total and free T3 levels or to a direct effect of amiodarone at the pituitary level.", "PMC2175373": "ANF and Ang II have opposing functions in volume homeostasis. The extent to which they interact functionally in the glomerulus, tubules and vasculature of the kidney is examined. Functional antagonism occurs in the glomerulus due to actions on different components; ANF appears to act mainly on capillary permeability and Ang II on vasculature and capillary surface area. A major cellular interaction is apparent in the proximal tubule where inhibition of sodium transport by ANF appears to be Ang II-dependent. No interaction is evident in the distal nephron, but an opposing functional action on medullary vasculature has been demonstrated.", "PMC2965243": "Our molecular modeling studies suggested that the conformational effects of the \"cystine-line\" residue Pmp1-Cys6 on the cyclohexapeptide ring of the vasopressin antagonist [Pmp1,D-Phe2,Val4]AVP might be mimicked by substitution of D-aminoadipic acid at position 6 and cyclization of its side-chain carboxyl to the alpha-amine of residue 2. The peptide was prepared with DL-aminoadipic acid, and following cyclization, the two diastereomeric peptides were separated and purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure of each was confirmed by amino acid analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The chirality of the aminoadipic acid residue of each peptide was determined by chiral gas chromatography. The circular dichroism spectrum of each peptide was run and compared with the appropriate agonist and antagonist peptide standards. These peptides demonstrated in vitro poor V2-receptor affinity and an inability to inhibit or stimulate vasopressin-induced adenylate cyclase formation, suggesting that they lack one or more key features of the agonist/antagonist pharmacophore.", "PMC2936398": "To investigate the effect of hypoinsulinaemia on prenatal growth, individual fetal rabbits were injected intramuscularly with streptozotocin (STZ) at 23 days of gestation following surgical reduction of litter number to 4 at 9 days' gestation. Two days after giving STZ (300 micrograms/g), plasma insulin levels were decreased, but by 30 days' gestation in either insulin nor glucose levels differed significantly from values in control fetuses. Despite only temporary hypoinsulinaemia, severe growth retardation was caused by STZ (300 micrograms/g estimated fetal weight), fetuses at 30 days' gestation weighing only 58% of the mean value obtained in saline-injected controls. At 250 micrograms/g STZ caused growth retardation in 3 out of 8 fetuses. A higher rate (500 micrograms/g) caused fetal death. The extent of growth retardation caused by STZ varied amongst tissues in the conceptus. Placenta and brain were not significantly altered, but relative to the size of the placenta the kidneys and empty carcass were severely retarded. The relationship between carcass and kidney weights did not differ from that in naturally small fetuses of the same age. Protein and RNA concentrations in the carcass were not altered by STZ, but that of DNA was reduced. In the placenta, DNA concentration was increased and RNA decreased. These observations are consistent with a major effect of hypoinsulinaemia on the growth of carcass and renal tissues, though loss of a renal growth factor cannot be ruled out.", "PMC2905946": "1. Erythrocytes from different vertebrate classes were tested for susceptibility towards copper ion-induced lysis under identical copper ion concentration and per cent cell volumes. 2. The susceptibility towards lysis was found to be correlated with the rate of copper ion entry into the erythrocytes. 3. GSH levels decline in red blood cells at a rate proportional to the rate of copper ion entry. 4. Hemolysis does not seem to be causally related to the level of GSH in the erythrocytes.", "PMC2661963": "Lymphocytic hypophysitis is an uncommon but increasingly recognized disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and destruction of the anterior pituitary. Three new cases are presented here with a review of the 27 previously reported cases. The disease affects primarily young women in late pregnancy or in the postpartum period but also has been described in postmenopausal women and in one man. It presents as an expanding intrasellar mass or as partial or panhypopituitarism. The etiology may be autoimmune. The natural history of this entity begins with enlargement of the pituitary secondary to inflammatory infiltration and progresses to atrophy of the gland with destruction of pituitary tissue and replacement with fibrosis. At least 1 patient had documented recovery of pituitary function, and the overall potential incidence of recoverable function is unknown. Our improved understanding of this disease has led us to conclude that surgical intervention is not always necessary.", "PMC4038803": "In acute ethanol studies aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) alone produced marked hypothermia although a test dose of ethanol was able to produce a further drop in body temperature in AOAA treated mice. Even though tolerance to ethanol-induced hypothermia was present in ethanol-dependent mice, AOAA administration was able to produce a further decrease in body temperature. Bicuculline potentiated ethanol-induced hypothermia in the acute studies but the tolerance to hypothermia which had developed in ethanol-dependent mice prevented the bicuculline-induced potentiation of ethanol hypothermia. AOAA markedly potentiated acute ethanol-induced motor incoordination whereas bicuculline had no effect. Although partial tolerance had developed to ethanol-induced motor incoordination in dependent mice, AOAA potentiated, whereas a lower dose of bicuculline antagonized, motor incoordination. In the acute studies ethanol had a biphasic effect on AOAA-induced GABA accumulation in the hypothalamus and corpus striatum: low doses prevented and a slightly higher dose was without effect on GABA accumulation. Ethanol-dependent mice were unable to respond to an AOAA-induced increase in GABA accumulation although basal levels of GABA were unaffected by chronic ethanol ingestion. The results show that brain GABA or GABA-mediated central mechanisms may be involved in the mediation of ethanol-induced motor incoordination but not hypothermia.", "PMC2681179": "The orientation of Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction center complexes (RC complexes) in proteoliposomal membranes was investigated by a direct electrometric method. Conditions were found that allow monitoring of only that RC complex fraction that is oriented with its donor side to the inner part of the proteoliposome. It is shown that o-phenanthroline, an inhibitor of electron transfer between primary (QA) and secondary (QB) quinone acceptors, can also inhibit the photoinduced QA reduction. The efficiency of this inhibition depends on the concentration of added ubiquinone. It is assumed that the laser flash-induced o-phenanthroline inhibition of primary dipole (P-870+.QA-) formation is of a competitive nature.", "PMC2850368": "Crystalline adenylate kinase from porcine muscle cytosol can assume two interconvertible structures. Here, we report the refined structure of crystal form B at 3.3 A resolution and compare it with crystal form A. Crystal forms A and B can be interconverted by protonation and deprotonation of His36, which is located deep in the active center cleft. The changes concern the molecular packing as well as the polypeptide chain conformation. On conversion from crystal form A to B, the N-terminal alpha-helix unwinds, the active center cleft opens to some extent and the nucleotide-binding glycine-rich loop 15-22 at the active center is detached from the bulk protein. This loop has counterparts in various important mononucleotide-binding proteins and is known to bind a phosphoryl group in adenylate kinase and in the oncogenic ras proteins. It is most likely involved in the phosphoryl transfer and the concomitant conformational changes. it is suggested that the two observed conformations are relevant for enzyme action in solution: they represent two of a series of three known snapshots depicting the enzyme during the substrate binding process.", "PMC3300031": "A test-system was developed on the basis of solid-phase enzyme-immunoassay using protein A/peroxidase conjugate for the determination of antibody levels to influenza virus in sera of humans who had experienced a natural infection or received a live influenza vaccine. The accurate observation of the test conditions was demonstrated to give the results well correlating with those of the HI test. The use of isolated hemagglutinin as the antigen considerably increased the specificity of the enzyme-immunoassay and in a number of cases detected a 4-fold or higher rise of antibody titres to hemagglutinin in paired sera of the vaccinees where the HI test showed no rise in antibody titres.", "PMC2626596": "A new species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Azospirillum irakense, was found associated with roots and the rhizosphere of rice in the region of Diwaniyah (Qadisya), Iraq. The seven isolates, on which the species description is based, have vibrioid to S-shaped cells with one polar flagellum in liquid medium. Additional lateral flagella are seen on cells grown on nutrient agar. Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate granules are present in cells. Nitrogen fixation occurs in microaerobic conditions. The phenotypic characters were found to be very close to those of A. amazonense with the following differences: growth occurred in the presence of 3% NaCl, and at pH 5.5 and 8.5, myo-inositol was not utilized as sole source of carbon and energy and pectin was slowly (6 to 9 days) hydrolysed. The seven studied strains formed a DNA-relatedness group distinct from other Azospirillum and Herbaspirillum species. The G + C content of the DNA was 64 to 67 mol %. The type strain is KBC1 (CIP 103311).", "PMC1112618": "Endotoxic lipopolysachharide (LPS) was obtained from phenol-water extraction of cell walls prepared from mass-cultivated Fusobacterium necrophorum. The LPS was relatively free of nucleic acids and low in protein, and constituted about 4% of the cell walls. Upon acid hydrolysis, some of the components detected were hexosamines (7.0%), neutral and reducing sugars (50.5%), heptose (6.4%), 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (0.8%), lipid A (21.0%), and phosphorus (1.7%). Under electron microscopy the LPS appeared mainly as ribbon-like trilaminar structures, and upon chemical treatment it displayed a behavior resembling that reported in certain enterobacterial LPS. The LPS was lethal to mice, 11-day-old chicken embryos, and rabbits. Endotoxicity in mice was enhanced at least 1,380-fold by the addition of 12.5 mug of actinomycin D. Induced tolerance to lethal effect of the endotoxin and rapidly acquired resistance to infection by F. necrophrum viable cells were also demonstrated in mice. The endotoxin produced both localized and generalized Shwartzman reactions as well as biphasic pyrogenic responses in rabbits. These results firmly establish the presence of a classical endotoxin in F. necrophorum, thus providing strong support to our recent suggestion that cell wall-associated components may contribute significantly to the pathogenicity of F. necrophorum.", "PMC1297648": "We have used the globin family of genes in chicken to study developmental regulation of gene expression, both at the level of individual interaction of trans-acting factors with local promoters and enhancers, and at the level of chromatin structure. Regulation of all members of the alpha- and beta-globin clusters is affected by the erythroid regulatory factor GATA-1. Separate mechanisms exist for regulation of individual members of the family. As an example, we describe the control mechanisms that play a role in the expression of the rho-globin gene, which is expressed only in primitive lineage erythroid cells. In addressing the involvement of chromatin structure in gene activation, we have examined the role of locus control elements, and also considered the way in which RNA polymerase molecules might accommodate to the presence of nucleosomes on transcribed genes.", "PMC3037847": "For the purpose of evaluating electron microscopy of tissue culture in making the diagnosis of sphingolipidoses, an ultrastructural study was made on the cultured fibroblasts from 23 patients with the disorders. The characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions were observed in the cultured cells of Fabry disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, generalized gangliosidosis, Niemann-Pick disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and multiple sulfatase deficiency, and differ in fine structure with these diseases. All these cytoplasmic inclusions were surrounded by a single limiting membrane and enzyme cytochemically showed acid phosphatase activity, indicating their lysosomal origin. Ultrastructurally, the cytoplasmic inclusions showed pleomorphic osmiophilic inclusions in Fabry disease, membranous cytoplasmic bodies (MCB) in Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease, MCB and vacuolar inclusions containing finely reticulogranular materials in generalized gangliosidosis, myelin-like inclusions in Niemann-Pick disease, concentric lamellar inclusions in metachromatic leukodystrophy, and polymorphic cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple sulfatase deficiency. In the heterozygous carriers of Fabry disease, pleomorphic osmiophilic inclusions were also detected. However, any specific inclusions were not detectable in the cultured fibroblasts of Gaucher disease and Krabbe disease. Availability of electron microscopy in the cultured fibroblasts of sphingolipidoses is discussed.", "PMC4348036": "We describe two patients with metachromatic leucodystrophy who presented with peripheral neuropathy and had no evidence of central nervous system involvement at the time of presentation. Such an occurrence is not well recognized and the diagnosis is usually missed until the other features of the disease manifest themselves. Early recognition of this disease may become of practical importance from the point of view of therapy, judging from recent developments, and is also important from the point of view of genetic counselling. We suggest that cases of peripheral neuropathy in infancy and childhood, should be subjected to peripheral nerve biopsy when the aetiology is not obvious.", "PMC3447402": "On the basis of the results obtained in the examination of 61 patients with atherosclerotic dementia, the author has established general clinical peculiarities of dementia: asthenia, rigidity and the fluctuations in the patients' status. The main types of dementia (general organic, torpid, pseudoparalytic, and amnestic) reflecting the characteristics of cerebrovascular pathology detected by computer tomography of the brain, as well as patterns of the disease (stroke, mixed and stroke-free) have been defined. The main types of structural changes in the patients' brain (foci of lower density, expansion of the CSF spaces and diffuse decrease in the bran density) have been identified. The aggregate of tomographic signs preferable for each type of atherosclerotic dementia and the correlation between the severity of dementia and elicited structural alterations in the brain have been ascertained.", "PMC2670983": "In order to improve the sensitivity of immunometric assays, a chromatographic technique was developed that virtually climinates components causing non-specific background. Labelled antibodies were applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column in physiological buffer. When labelled antibodies were purified by this technique, the non-specific background of various time-resolved immunofluorometric assays was reduced 3- to 10-fold and was very close to the instrument background. The assay sensitivity was simultaneously increased by a factor of 2 to 16. This purification method might be used to improve the results of immunometric assays in general.", "PMC3447404": "Using experimental and psychological techniques (Koos' cubes, Luria's methods) 200 patients with the second stage of chronic alcoholism have been examined. The function of constructive performance was found to be impaired. The central defect of the constructive performance of the representative group was an impaired ability to space the elements of the construction. All errors of the examined patients were due to the defect of optico-spatial perception which is suggestive of impaired functions of the parietooccipital portions of the brain. In confirmation of the above conclusion the authors present the results of neuropsychological examination of 95 patients in the state of abstinence and after it has been eliminated.", "PMC3818063": "The range of injuries sustained at an ice-rink and presented to an Accident Service department is described. A total of 203 patients with 222 injuries presented themselves during a 2-month period. There were 103 noteworthy injuries, including 61 fractures, 2 dislocations and 2 severed tendons, but the commonest injuries were wounds, sprains and bruises. Beginners appear to be more prone to injury than experienced skaters. In addition to using well-fitting skate-boots to protect the ankle, some injuries could be avoided by wearing elbow and knee pads, and a thick pair of gloves. The number of injuries compared with the total number of skaters was small but produced a noteworthy increase in the workload of the Accident Service.", "PMC3337327": "The quality of care of random samples of about 40 infants admitted with acute gastroenteritis to each of five hospitals in Jamaica was assessed. Low levels of adherence to consensus care criteria appeared to be correlated with high levels of hospital-specific severity standardized mortality ratios X100 (SSMRs); poor adherence, SSMR 127-230; intermediate adherence, SSMR 95; good adherence, SSMR 14. The main deficiencies in care at certain hospitals were: non-weighing of infants, incomplete physical examination, inadequate estimation of fluid requirements, and irregular recording of fluid intake.

By comparison with animals given injections of the vehicle alone, the animals given this mediator had elevated levels of leukotriene C4-immunoreactive material (LTC4 im) in the exudate and decreased quantities of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and of 6-Keto-F1 alpha-prostaglandin (6-Keto PGF1 alpha). Nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem reduced the pleural exudate with no major effect on the mediators. Both salbutamol and theophylline reduced the exudate and the levels of LTC4 im. Acetylsalicylic acid, phenylbutazone and indomethacin significantly inhibited the exudate, greatly lowered the quantities of cyclooxygenase derivatives and tended to increase LTC4 im. Phenidone, which inhibits the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, decreased the exudate and the three mediators. The phospholipase A2 inhibitor, chloroquine, decreased both the amount of exudate and moderately the concentration of LTC4 im. The glucocorticoids studied had no effect on the exudate or on the mediators. These results suggest that the role of the increased LTC4 im in the induction of the pleurisy is not clear.", "PMC3334905": "The sudden onset of a novel or behaviorally significant stimulus usually triggers responses that orient the eyes, external ears, head and/or body toward the source of the stimulus. As a consequence, the reception of additional signals originating from the source and the sensory guidance of appropriate limb and body movements are facilitated. Converging lines of evidence, derived from anatomical, electrophysiological and lesion experiments, indicate that the superior colliculus is an important part of the neural substrate responsible for the generation of orienting responses. This paper briefly reviews the functional organization of the mammalian superior colliculus and discusses possible linkages between the sensory and motor maps observed in this structure. The hypothesis is advanced that the sensory maps are organized in motor (not sensory) coordinates and that the maps of sensory space are dynamic, shifting with relative movements of the eyes, head and body.", "PMC2435149": "Abdominal fat aspiration samples from 443 consecutive patients were examined for amyloid after Congo red and hematoxylin staining. Of the aspirates from 83 patients known to have systemic amyloid disease prior to the biopsy, 70 (84 percent) were found to yield positive results. The results for four aspirates from patients with localized amyloid disease were negative. Of the aspirates from 356 patients of unknown clinical status referred for analysis by outside physicians, 26 (7 percent) yielded positive results for amyloid. On review of the clinical records of these 26 patients, 11 had proved systemic amyloidosis demonstrated on biopsy of another site; all had a clinical course consistent with amyloid disease. In no case was amyloid found in a fat aspiration sample from a patient without clinical evidence suggestive of systemic amyloid disease. This study supports the proposal that abdominal fat aspiration is the diagnostic procedure of choice in the evaluation of amyloidosis since it requires no specialty consultation or technical expertise, causes minimal patient discomfort, and is accompanied by virtually no risk of morbid complication. A positive result has a high predictive value of amyloid disease in patients of unknown clinical status.", "PMC3064516": "Preparation STP, a new immunostimulating agent, is a substance produced by Streptococcus strain sp.

Mild AP usually subsides spontaneously. On the other hand, severe AP requires admission to an intensive care unit and supportive care for multiple organ failure. During the second phase of the disease, repeated CT scans with the routine use of percutaneous fine needle aspiration and drainage allows both diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic abscesses. However, infected necrosis usually requires surgical drainage. The treatment of acute biliary pancreatitis must be performed during the same admission for mild AP. In contrast, it seems better to postpone any kind of surgical treatment in the severe forms of gallstone pancreatitis.

This question was addressed in 30 men between 20 and 76 years of age who were known as a group to have experienced significant age-related loss of Leydig cells. If the loss of Leydig cells resulted from transformation into another cell type, other testicular interstitial cells in these men should have increased with age. Testes obtained at autopsy were perfused with glutaraldehyde less than 15 h after sudden death due to trauma or heart attack. Numbers of other interstitial cells were determined by quantitative histometric estimation of the proportion of testicular parenchyma occupied by other interstitial cell nuclei of measured average volume. Other interstitial cell nuclei declined significantly with advancing age (rho = -0.41, P less than 0.05). Mean number of other interstitial cell nuclei per individual was significantly reduced in the 15 men 50 yr old or older compared to the 15 younger men (460 +/- 34 million vs. 609 +/- 43 million; P less than 0.05). There was no tendency for individuals with reduced numbers of Leydig cells to have increased numbers of other interstitial cells. These findings argued against the persistence of Leydig cells in aged testes as dedifferentiated mesenchymal elements. Instead, light and electron microscopic observation of testes from these men revealed evidence of Leydig cell degeneration and dissolution.", "PMC2330239": "A questionnaire was sent to all pediatric training programs to evaluate the use of pulmonary function reference standards and the interpretation of pulmonary function test results. Responses were obtained from 107 of 130 institutions, and 94 of these had pulmonary function laboratories available. Of the 94, 60 used one of three reference standards. The primary reason the reference standards were chosen was either unknown or because they came with the spirometer (24), were recommended by another person or were those used in that person's training (34), or were thought to be the best standards available or most applicable to the population to be tested (31). To define abnormality, most used an 80% predicted cutoff for forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% vital capacity. For a change in an individual through time, most used a 10% change for forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% vital capacity. Thirteen used statistical methods to define abnormal individuals and none used statistical methods to define a significant change over time. Although there are a few guidelines for reference standards and interpretations of pulmonary function tests, it appears that most laboratories are not using those guidelines and that further guidelines and education are needed.", "PMC150459": "Sixty laminectomies were performed in dogs to investigate the prevention of the laminectomy membrane and its side effects. These operations were distributed in six groups of 10, one was a control group, and in the others the bone defect was protected with different materials (Oxicel, Silastic, Dacron, methyl methacrylate, and Kiel bone graft). After a survival of 2 months, suboccipital myelography was performed, immediately after which the animals were sacrificed and the operated spinal slice obtained. The different radiographic densities of the tissues of each slice were calculated and the diverse histological nature identified by hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff, Masson's trichrome, and Gomori's reticulin strains. Only the acrylic plastic and the Kiel bone graft prevented expansion of the scar tissue inside the spinal canal and adhesions between the dura and the cicatrical overlying muscles.

To determine whether discontinuing heparin poses a clinical risk, we examined the charts of 378 patients treated with heparin for transient ischaemic attack (TIA), reversible ischaemic neurological deficit, or ischaemic stroke from October 1979 to June 1985. Clinical deterioration, or a new TIA or stroke was more likely (p = 0.01) during the 24 hours after heparin was stopped in patients not already on aspirin or warfarin (10/143, 7%) than in patients receiving aspirin or warfarin before heparin withdrawal (3/215, 1%).

A single peak of an alkaline protease was subsequently obtained with a 9-fold increase in specific activity and a final recovery value of 26.2%. The enzyme had optimal activity at 37 degrees C and a pH of 7.8. The enzyme did not degrade leucine amide, hippurylphenylalanine and hippurylarginine indicating lack of exo-protease activity. However, endo-protease activity led to a rapid hydrolysis of gelatin with optimal activity at 40 degrees C and pH 7.8.

This stimulatory protein, designated herein factor D, also increases 2-3-fold the activity of polymerase alpha with heat-denatured DNA and with primed, circular single-stranded phi X174 DNA. However, factor D has no detectable effect on the copying by polymerase alpha of poly(dG), poly(dA), and poly(dC) templates. Activity of mouse DNA polymerase beta is not affected by factor D with all the tested templates. In contrast to polymerase alpha, factor D is resistant to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide and calcium ions, but it is readily heat-inactivated at 46 degrees C and is inactivated by trypsin digestion. Partially purified factor D is not associated with detectable activities of DNA polymerase, DNA primase, deoxyribonucleotidyl terminal transferase, and endo- or exodeoxyribonuclease.", "PMC3627382": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor partial agonist THIP inhibits the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to unwashed membranes from the forebrain of the rat at 0 degrees C in the absence of chloride ions, reducing the affinity and Bmax of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. The decrease in affinity of benzodiazepine receptors seems to be due to antagonism by THIP of the effects of endogenous GABA, present in the unwashed membrane preparation. When the binding with washed membranes was determined at 30 degrees C, in the presence of chloride ions, THIP like GABA enhanced the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam through an increase in the affinity of benzodiazepine receptors. The changes in the affinity of benzodiazepine receptors induced by THIP seem to be mediated by bicuculline-sensitive receptors. However, in the presence and absence of bicuculline, THIP reduced the total number of benzodiazepine binding sites, probably in a bicuculline insensitive manner.", "PMC3329960": "Four cases of brain abscess in neonates are described, diagnosed by ultrasonography and CT. All abscesses were confirmed surgically. One patient was operated on 5 weeks after diagnosis because of initial parental refusal. The etiology in all cases was meningitis superimposed on an hypoxic-ischemic insult. Two cases had a single abscess while the other two had multiple lesions. All cases were operated on with intraoperative ultrasound examination through the fontanelle. The case with delayed aspiration showed complete evolution from localized cerebritis to complete capsule formation with mass effect. One abscess was sterile, and in the others grew Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes. The microorganism initially isolated from the lumbar CSF was also found in the abscess.

Condensation of TA-2',5'-DP with 1,4-dibromobutanedione or 1,3-dibromo-2-propanone gave the final products 2-BDB-TA-2',5'-DP and 2-BOP-TA-2',5'-DP, respectively. The structure of these new reagents was determined by UV, 1H NMR, 31P NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as by bromide and phosphorus analysis. Both of these reagents exhibit properties expected for an affinity label of the coenzyme site of NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. With both reagents, biphasic kinetics of inactivation are observed that can be described in terms of a fast initial phase of inactivation resulting in partially active enzyme of 6-7% residual activity, followed by a slower phase leading to total inactivation. The inactivation rate constants for both reagents exhibit a nonlinear dependence on reagent concentration, consistent with the formation of a reversible complex with the enzyme prior to irreversible modification. The enzyme incorporates both reagents to a limited extent and is protected against inactivation by NADP+ and NADPH. The reaction of these new nucleotide analogues with isocitrate dehydrogenase is compared to the much slower inactivation caused by bromoacetone, indicating the importance of the nucleotide moiety in the functioning of the affinity labels. It is likely that 2-BDB-TA-2',5'-DP and 2-BOP-TA-2',5'-DP will have general applicability as affinity labels for other NADP+ binding enzymes.", "PMC1781455": "Sharks, skates, and rays (Elasmobranchii) have evolved unique osmoregulatory strategies to survive in marine habitats. These adaptations include a complex renal countercurrent system for urea retention. The fine structure of the complete renal tubular epithelium has yet to be elucidated in any species of cartilagenous fish. The present study, which is a companion to our recent paper describing the ultrastructure of the neck and proximal segments of the elasmobranch nephron, uses thin sections and freeze-fracture replicas to elucidate the fine structural organization of the intermediate, distal, and collecting duct segments of the little skate, Raja erinacea, renal tubule. The epithelium of the intermediate, distal, and collecting duct segments consists of two major cell types: nonflagellar cells, the major epithelial cell type; and flagellar cells, described elsewhere. The intermediate segment consists of six subdivisions lined by cuboidal-columnar cells with variously elaborated microvilli and interdigitations of lateral and basal cell plasma membranes, as well as some subdivisions with distinctive vesicles and granules. The distal segment consists of two subdivisions, both of which are lined by a simple epithelium, and are distinguished from each other by their distinctive contents; dense bodies and granules. The collecting duct segment also has two subdividions, the first lined by a simple columnar epithelium and the second by a stratified columnar epithelium. Both subdivisions have apical secretory granules. The present findings show a more highly specialized and diverse epithelium lining the renal tubule of these cartilagenous fish than is found in either of the \"adjacent\" phylogenetic taxa, Agnatha or Ostheichthyes, suggesting significant differences among these groups in transepithelial transport mechanisms and renal function.", "PMC2675499": "The possibility of formalizing the recognition of the genera of enterobacteria by means of a heterogeneous sequential procedure with the use of diagnostic tables and simple arithmetic operations has been shown.", "PMC3311146": "Cyclic nucleotide independent protein kinases preferring casein as in vitro substrates were resolved into four distinct species. Only one of the enzymes (CKII) was retained by DEAE-cellulose, whereas the three other enzymes (CKI-1, CKI-2, and CKI-3) were absorbed to CM-Sephadex, eluted with 250 and 600 mM NaCl, and fractionated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The casein kinase CKI-3 eluting at the highest NaCl concentration (550 mM) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography. CKI-1 and CKI-2 correspond to mammalian type I casein kinase, because they bind to CM-Sephadex, they are monomeric enzymes of molecular weights below 50,000, they accept ATP exclusively (CKI-1) or predominantly (CKI-2) as phosphate donor, and they are either completely or relatively heparin insensitive. CKII corresponds to type II casein kinase due to its chromatographic properties, complex quaternary structure, nucleotide specificity (both ATP and GTP are phosphate donors), and heparin sensitivity. CKI-3 shares the following properties with type I casein kinases: it is retained by CM-Sephadex but not by DEAE-cellulose, and it consists of a monomeric protein having a molecular weight of 38,000. On the other hand, CKI-3 accepts both ATP and GTP with equal efficiency, and it is heparin sensitive (50% inhibition at 0.3 microgram/mL) like type II casein kinases. CKI-3 differs from the other three yeast casein kinases in requiring a low pH (5.5) and a high MgCl2 concentration (50 mM) for optimal activity. All four casein kinases phosphorylate their own catalytic protein at serine and threonine residues.", "PMC3043253": "Biological systems are hypothesized to control behavior with reference to invariants, because this would allow the variable but robust accomplishment of tasks observed in biological behaviors.

Naphthylhydrazides and arylhydrazides, used as the labels, were incorporated via their imidate or their succinimide esters. Conjugating the carboxy terminal of (amino ethyl)ethyl-isoluminol to SmC via a succinimide linkage supplied the most sensitive detection limit and the most immunoreactive conjugate. We developed an immunoassay based on the use of this conjugate, and evaluated dextran-coated charcoal, second-antibody precipitation, and solid-phase immunoprecipitation for separating bound and free label. This chemiluminescent method has a detection limit of 16 pg per tube, and it is accurate and precise. Correlation studies with a conventional radioimmunoassay (x) for SmC gave the following regression equation: y = 0.66x + 3.76 (r = 0.953, n = 30); the slight discrepancies between the two methods are probably ascribable to the use of different antibodies. We thus propose this chemiluminescence immunoassay as an inexpensive and sensitive alternative to radioimmunoassay for measuring SmC in serum or in extracts of serum.", "PMC3927764": "Forty patients undergoing day-case anaesthesia for surgical extraction of third molar teeth received either lysine acetylsalicylate 1.8 g in 10 ml of saline intravenously or a placebo injection of 10 ml of saline intravenously just prior to induction of anaesthesia.

Their median age was 70 (range 36-84) years, and none was taking any cardioactive medication known to affect the QT interval. From a baseline pacing rate of 50 or 110 beats.min-1 the ventricular rate was increased or decreased to a new level. The time taken for the ventricular paced QT interval to complete 90% of the change secondary to the change in rate was found to be 136(16) s (mean(SEM] when the rate was increasing and 189(25) s when the rate was decreasing (p less than 0.01). This time interval was independent of the magnitude of the rate change and the baseline heart rate from which the change occurred. Furthermore, the time course of QT adaptation was found to be exponential and was characterised by a time constant of 49.1(2.2) s when the rate was increasing and 60.4(2.0) s when the rate was decreasing (p less than 0.01).

Follow-up ranged from 2 to 148 months (mean, 46.9 months). Seven-year actuarial patency rate was 100% for SCT and 86% +/- 7% for CSB (p = NS). Mean operative time and intraoperative blood loss were significantly reduced for SCT (p less than 0.05). After CSB a continuous deterioration of the hemodynamic status of the reconstruction was noted, whereas there were no significant changes after SCT (p less than 0.05).

The uptake of glutamate consists of two components, one Na-independent and one Na-dependent. The Na-dependent uptake is saturable (half-maximal at 250 microM external glutamate) and is inhibited by a variety of analogues of which L-cysteate and D- and L-aspartate are the most potent. These amino acids are also transported into the muscle in a Na-dependent manner. The excitatory agonists kainate, quisqualate, and N-methyl-D-aspartate do not inhibit or affect uptake in any way. Progressive replacement of external Na by choline reduces uptake with very little effect on the apparent affinity for glutamate, suggesting that Na and glutamate bind to the transporter independently. The kinetics of activation are consistent with a requirement for at least two Na ions. Na activation of glutamate uptake can be inhibited by guanidinium with kinetics that are consistent with competitive inhibition at the Na binding site. Studies on the efflux of L-glutamate and other analogues have shown that efflux rates are only slightly increased by the removal of Na and do not seem to be affected in any clear manner by external levels of acidic amino acids.", "PMC2957228": "We studied the effect of electrical stimulation and a sodium channel blocker (tetrodotoxin) on the expression of muscle-specific isozymes of creatine kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, phosphoglycerate mutase, and lactate dehydrogenase in aneurally cultured embryonic rat muscle.

The calculation was made for glomoid as the subunit of the carotid body and the total organ by varying the following parameters: arterial PO2, oxygen consumption, hematocrit, diameter of the vessels, perfusion pressure, and capillary length. The results provide explanations for differences in the literature about the tissue PO2 distribution in the cat carotid body. Differences in the capillary length of the carotid bodies seem to be the main reason for different PO2 histograms.

Singh, R. P. Singh, A. Bhushan, and A. K. Singh (1985) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 236, 418-426]. This observation suggested that palmitoyl-CoA and lignoceroyl-CoA may be synthesized by two different enzymes. We have solubilized the acyl-CoA ligase activities for palmitic and lignoceric acid of rat brain microsomal membranes with Triton X-100 and resolved them into three separate peaks (fractions) by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Fraction A (palmitoyl-CoA ligase) had high specific activity for palmitic acid and Fraction C (lignoceroyl-CoA ligase) for lignoceric acid. Specific activity of palmitoyl-CoA ligase for palmitic acid was six times higher than in Fraction C and specific activity of lignoceroyl-CoA ligase for lignoceric acid was four times higher than in Fraction A. At higher concentrations of Triton X-100 (0.5%), lignoceroyl-CoA ligase loses activity whereas palmitoyl-CoA ligase does not. Lignoceroyl-CoA ligase lost 60% of activity at 0.6% Triton X-100. Palmitoyl-CoA ligase (T1/2 of 4.5 min) is more stable at 40 degrees C than lignoceroyl-CoA ligase (T1/2 of 1.5 min). The pH optimum of palmitoyl-CoA ligase was 7.7 and that of lignoceroyl-CoA ligase was 8.4. Similar to our results with intact membranes, palmitic acid solubilized with Triton WR-1339 was converted to palmitoyl-CoA by palmitoyl-CoA ligase whereas lignoceric acid when solubilized with Triton WR-1339 was not able to act as substrate for lignoceroyl-CoA ligase. Since solubilized enzyme activities for synthesis of palmitoyl-CoA and lignoceroyl-CoA from microsomal membranes can be resolved into different fractions by column chromatography and demonstrate different properties, we suggest that in microsomal membranes palmitoyl-CoA and lignoceroyl-CoA are synthesized by two different enzymes.", "PMC2136767": "Autoantibodies against U3 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein are associated with scleroderma autoimmune disease.

We isolated a 1.6-kilobase cDNA encoding fibrillarin from a Xenopus laevis cDNA library. The protein contains a 79-residue-long Gly-Arg-rich domain in its N-terminal region and a putative RNA-binding domain with ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence in its central portion.

Benzodiazepines, administered i.v., decreased cell firing and increased the duration of the inhibitory response but did not alter the relationship between the two parameters. These effects of one benzodiazepine, RU 32007, were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 which had little effect alone. The benzodiazepine inverse agonists methyl- or ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate increased cell firing with the expected reductions in duration of inhibitory response in some cases. However, in 50% of recordings the inhibitory response disappeared, independent of the firing rate. All the effects of the beta-carboline esters were reversed by Ro15-1788 or the benzodiazepine, RU 32007.

Yeast EF-1 alpha apparently functions in a stoichiometric manner in the binding reaction of AA-tRNA to the ribosomes. The addition of EF-3 and ATP to this binding system strikingly stimulated the binding reaction, and the stimulated reaction proceeded catalytically with respect to both EF-1 alpha and EF-3, accompanied by ATP hydrolysis, indicating that EF-3 stimulated the AA-tRNA binding reaction by releasing EF-1 alpha from the ribosomal complex, thus recycling it. This binding stimulation by EF-3 was in many respects distinct from that by EF-1 beta gamma. The idea that EF-3 may participate in the regeneration of GTP from ATP and the formed GDP, as indicated by the findings that the addition of EF-3 along with ATP allowed the AA-tRNA binding and Phe polymerization reactions to proceed even in the presence of GDP in place of GTP, was not verified by the results of direct measurement of [32P]GTP formation from [gamma-32P]ATP and GDP under various conditions. Examination of the stability of the bound AA-tRNA disclosed the different binding states of AA-tRNA on ribosomes between in the cases of the complexes formed with EF-1 alpha alone, or factor-independently, and with EF-1 alpha and EF-3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2877798": "Using the medaka, Oryzias latipes (orange-red variety), the mechanisms of action on leucophores of adenosine and adenine nucleotides, including cyclic AMP, were studied.

The following four kinds of sensory nerve ending were found: muscle spindle in the puborectalis and the external anal sphincter, Pacinian corpuscle in the plane between the internal anal sphincter and the external anal sphincter and in the presacral space, globular ending in the presacral space, and free nerve ending in the epithelium of the anal canal and in the perianal skin. It was found that there were significantly fewer muscle spindles in the puborectalis and many fewer Pacinian corpuscles and globular endings in the presacral space of high and intermediate deformities than normal. No spindle was found in the external sphincteric muscles of the deformities. On the other hand, the Pacinian corpuscles and the globular endings of high and intermediate deformities lagged behind normal in development. The densities of the nerve bundles in the subepidermis and the nerve fibers in the dermis of perineal region in high and intermediate deformities were much lower than normal, and the decrease in density corresponded to the levels of the rectal pouch. The observation showed that the agenesis of sensory nerve endings in the puborectalis and the anal region was one of the most significant pathological features in high and intermediate types of anorectal anomalies, and might be responsible for the abnormalities of the reflex of the anal sphincter and the anal sensation in such patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2395249": "A case of constrictive pericarditis which developed within one month after the onset of acute pericarditis was presented.

Such repeated measures for both maternal and offspring endpoints routinely are incorporated into developmental toxicology studies to allow characterization of the profile of treatment-related effects over time. To permit a valid statistical analysis, repeated measures studies are characterized by: random assignment of treatment to experimental units, measurement of the variable(s) of interest at the same time points for all animals, and avoidance of systematic overlaying of treatment and potential response gradients. Assumptions for and advantages of the use of a repeated measures analysis of variance versus single-factor analyses at each time point are illustrated in two data sets from a rat perinatal and postnatal study. The variance-covariance structure of repeated measures designs dictates that adjustments are necessary to provide protection against inflated Type 1 error rates.

To overcome these side effects the patient was placed on hydrocortisone 20 mg at 8 AM plus spironalactone 50 mg q.i.d. Cushingoid features vanished and response to cosyntropin (ACTH 250 ug i.m.) was reestablished. To better ascertain the effects of this treatment we studied the circadian variation in serum 17-OH progesterone after hydrocortisone was administered at 8 AM and compared it with circadian variations under basal conditions or after late-evening (11 PM) administration of hydrocortisone, 20 mg. The early morning administration of hydrocortisone was unable to prevent the nocturnal elevation of 17-OH-progesterone in spite of normal levels from 9.30 AM to 3 AM. This nocturnal peak was associated with a slightly blunted nocturnal elevation of serum cortisol.

In PHP, PRL levels were significantly reduced up to 300 min after terguride with a nadir (45 +/- 4.0% SE) significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than the one observed in the 8 normal subjects (72 +/- 3.5%). There was no significant difference in plasma PRL levels after 0.2 mg terguride or lisuride in 7 out of 15 patients tested with both drugs.

DESIGN: This was a cross sectional epidemiological survey of headache disorders in a general population. Headache was diagnosed according to a structured interview and a neurological examination using the criteria of the International Headache Society. SETTING: A random sample of 25-64 year-old individuals was drawn from the Danish National Central Person Registry. All subjects were living in the Copenhagen County. PARTICIPANTS: 740 subjects participated (76% of the sample); 119 had migraine and 578 had tension type headache. MAIN RESULTS: Among subjects with migraine 56% had, at some time, consulted their general practitioner because of the migraine. The corresponding percentage among subjects with tension type headache was 16. One or more specialists had been consulted by 16% of migraine sufferers and by 4% of subjects with tension type headache. The consultation rates of chiropractors and physiotherapists were 5-8%. Hospital admissions and supplementary laboratory investigations due to headache were rare (< 3%). Half of the migraine sufferers and 83% of subjects with tension type headache in the previous year had managed with at least one type of drug in the current year. Acetylsalicylic acid preparations and paracetamol were the most commonly used analgesics. Prophylaxis of migraine was used by 7%. In the preceding year 43% of employed migraine sufferers and 12% of employed subjects with tension type headache had missed one or more days of work because of headache. Most common was 1-7 days off work. The total loss of workdays per year due to migraine in the general population was estimated at 270 days per 1000 persons. For tension type headache the corresponding figure was 820. Women were more likely to consult a practitioner than men, whereas no significant sex difference emerged as regards absenteeism from work.

The peculiarities of circadian organization of external respiratory parameters which were used for administration of chronotherapy were revealed in the patients. Some time before the appearance of maximum deterioration of indices under study, mostly indices of bronchial permeability, drugs (broncholytics, inhalation steroids and intal) were administered. Objective and subjective methods of assessment of bronchial permeability using a diary of self-evaluation were compared. The substitution of laboratory investigation for self-evaluation will make it possible to widely use chrono-diagnosis and chronotherapy for patients with bronchial asthma, and chronotherapy was found to be more effective than commonly used therapeutic schemes.", "PMC2133171": "Twenty patients with essential hypertension, 5 with dyslipidemia type IIa and 15 with that of type IIb, were treated with bezafibrate, 200 mg/day. As control group, 20 normo or dislipemic patients with essential hypertension receiving no hypolipidemic drugs, and chosen at random, showed no significant changes of the mean values of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides at three evaluations made in a period of about six months. Six patients were males (60 +/- 4 years) and 14 females (57 +/- 2 years). The levels of cholesterolemia and triglyceridemia were evaluated before the administration of the drug and on the 28th and 56th day of its use. The mean initial value of total cholesterol (n = 20) was 334 +/- 10 mg/dl, lowering significantly (P less than 0.01) to 274 +/- 7 mg/dl and 279 +/- 11 mg/dl. Initial triglyceridemia level (n = 15) was 544 +/- 85 mg/dl, decreasing significantly (P less than 0.01) to 234 +/- 36 and 245 +/- 36. Percentual mean decrease of cholesterolemia was respectively 16 +/- 4% and 14 +/- 5% and that of triglyceridemia was 46 +/- 8% for both evaluations. Side effects of the drug were not seen with the indicated dose. The therapy was useful to lower the dislipemic values of the essential hypertensive patients, in spite of no consistent changes in their diet and physical activity and of its use for a short period.", "PMC3542126": "Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mutant mice, 3-4 months old, were used to identify and quantify the non-Purkinje cell GABAergic innervation of deep cerebellar nuclei. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactive structures appeared as dark dots throughout the 4 nuclei. Ultrastructural examination confirmed that each dot corresponded to an axon terminal. GAD-labeled boutons were large, contained tightly packed flattened vesicles and established Gray type II synapses with all nuclear neuronal populations. Thus, cytological criteria did not distinguish between Purkinje cell and non-Purkinje cell GAD-positive nerve terminals, since they shared many common features. The number of GAD-immunoreactive axon terminals in the deep nuclei of pcd cerebella was compared to that of normal C57BL mice. Despite an almost complete disappearance of Purkinje cells in the pcd mouse (less than 0.05% of these neurons remained in the mutants), the surface density of GAD-positive nerve terminals in the deep nuclear region was 37% of control value. Taking into account a volumetric decrease of 58% for the deep nuclei of the mutant cerebellum, we estimated the percentage of GAD-positive boutons innervating these nuclei to be 15% of normal values. This important residual innervation of the deep nuclei might arise from local GABAergic neurons, which were identified in the normal and mutant cerebella by immunostaining with an anti-GABA antibody.", "PMC2971551": "Tetanus toxoid (TT) was complexed with two human monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies recognized different, nonrepeating epitopes. The complexes formed were characterized by gel filtration and isokinetic sucrose density gradient centrifugation. It was found that in antigenic excess the separate antibodies formed a complex of one antibody molecule and two TT molecules [IgG1-(TT)2 and IgG3-(TT)2]. In cases where equal amounts of TT and both antibodies were mixed, a dimeric complex [IgG1-(TT)2-IgG3] was formed. The binding of these immune complexes to human neutrophils and eosinophils was studied. Whereas the immune complexes containing one antibody did not bind to either cell type, the two-antibody complex bound to both. This indicates that not the sterical change in the Fc part of an antibody molecule after binding an antigen, but the Fc valency of an immune complex is the decisive factor in Fc receptor interaction with neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes.", "PMC2573919": "An audit of the management of asthma in two large general practices has been undertaken. The overall level of therapy prescribed was, in general, related to both the objective severity of the patients' asthma and the extent of symptoms. However, many individual patients received sub-optimal therapy. Prophylactic inhaled beta agonists were used infrequently. Inhaled steroids were prescribed to only one third of the patients and to less than half of severely affected patients. The results suggest that this group of adult asthmatics were relatively under treated in general practice, but a prospective study with proven compliance is necessary to confirm this.", "PMC3817170": "This study was undertaken to determine whether women with endometriosis have altered protein, progesterone (P), and protease inhibitor concentrations in their uterine fluid and peritoneal fluid (PF) compared with controls at different phases of the menstrual cycle. Uterine flushings (UFs), PF, and blood were obtained during the follicular and luteal phases of the cycle from 29 normal women and 16 women who were diagnosed as having endometriosis. Protein content in UF did not change significantly throughout the cycle in either group. However, PF protein in patients with endometriosis was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than in controls during the luteal phase. Total UF P was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced in women with endometriosis during the late luteal phase. During the early luteal phase, trypsin inhibitory activity in UF from normal women was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than at any other phase of the cycle, whereas inhibitory activity in UF from patients with endometriosis remained relatively constant. Patients with endometriosis had significantly (P less than 0.05) higher total activity in PF during the early luteal phase than did controls. These results indicate that women suffering from endometriosis have significantly lower levels of P and less protease inhibitor within their uterine cavity during the luteal phase of the cycle, and significantly higher concentrations of protein and protease inhibitor in PF during the luteal phase.", "PMC3126751": "The major high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions were examined in angiographically defined cardiovascular patients with low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. The aims were to study subfraction concentration and composition, and the extent to which hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) modified these variables. Normotriglyceridaemic (NTG)-low HDL-C patients showed similar subfraction composition to age-matched healthy controls. However, these groups showed notable differences in subfraction composition compared to HTG-low HDL-C patients, particularly with regard to the HDL2 subfraction. HDL subfraction mass was significantly reduced in both cardiovascular groups; the HTG group showed a greater reduction in HDL2, whilst the NTG group showed a greater reduction in HDL3. The major HDL apoprotein (apo A-I) was lower in both subfractions of the cardiovascular patients. Apo A-II showed significant reductions only in the HTG patients.", "PMC3937728": "The informational suppressors su4-1 and su8-1 of Podospora anserina were isolated by transformation of Schizosaccharomyces pombe UGA mutants. The DNA sequence revealed that they were opal (UGA) suppressor tRNAs. Wild-type alleles were also isolated by hybridization. The DNA sequence showed that they both encode species of tRNASerUGA. The gene SU8 has an 18-bp intervening sequence and its primary sequence is very different from that of SU4.", "PMC2748937": "Nitroaromatic radiosensitizers are effective chemosensitizers in vitro and in vivo. We have used EMT6 tumour cells grown as multicellular spheroids to try and further understand the role that hypoxia plays in this process. Our results show that the cell killing produced in whole spheroids following a 1-h exposure to melphalan (L-PAM) was enhanced by a 3-h pre-exposure to 5 mM misonidazole (MISO), an enhancement ratio of 1.3-1.7 being obtained. Sequentially disaggregating spheroids we also found that both L-PAM toxicity and MISO chemosensitization were relatively constant as a function of depth within the spheroid. The binding of 14C-MISO to spheroid cells, measured by scintillation counting of disaggregated cells and by autoradiography analysis of sectioned spheroids, demonstrated that binding increased with depth. However, cells in the outer layers of the spheroid bound more 14C-MISO than expected with fully aerobic cells, while in the innermost viable cells the binding was less than that measured in cells which were fully radiobiologically hypoxic. This suggests that the majority of viable spheroid cells were at oxygen tensions intermediate between those found in either fully aerobic or radiobiologically hypoxic cells, yet their levels of oxygenation were sufficiently low for MISO chemosensitization to occur.", "PMC2976604": "The sera from 55 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with active immunotherapy were examined for the presence of antibodies against common ALL antigen (CALLA). A solid phase indirect radioimmunometric assay (IRA) was developed which enabled the detection of anti-CALLA antibody in patients' sera, utilizing the ability of affinity-purified CALLA to bind Ricinus communis agglutinin and anti-CALLA antibody simultaneously. Using IRA, anti-CALLA antibody activity could not be detected in a majority of patients. We concluded that the patients did not raise comparable antibodies against CALLA, indicating this antigen is not immunogenic for ALL patients.", "PMC2873827": "Two patients deliberately ingested single paper packages containing heroin. These were recovered intact by induction of emesis with syrup of ipecacuanha.", "PMC3377668": "The incidence of closed head injury (CHI) associated with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) has been estimated at 40% to 50%. Closed head injury can be defined as the presence of loss of consciousness (LOC) and/or posttraumatic amnesia (PTA). Consequently, one of the difficulties in establishing a diagnosis of CHI is determining the existence of PTA in those patients without documented LOC. Previous work described the inconsistent evaluation of PTA in the SCI population. This study was conducted to evaluate the utility of the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) in establishing the diagnosis of CHI in a series of acute traumatic SCI patients. The GOAT was administered serially for three to five days to 34 patients admitted to our hospital. When information derived from the GOAT was added to that derived from review of medical records alone, the observed incidence of PTA (and by implication CHI) increased significantly (McNemar statistic = 6.4; p = 0.01). The GOAT is a quick, simple, and reproducible evaluation of spheres of orientation, which is extremely helpful in diagnosis of PTA in this population. This instrument should be used to evaluate patients at high risk for head injury. Although abnormalities in the GOAT evaluation may also be attributable to factors other than CHI (eg, hypoxia, medication effects), such findings provide evidence suggestive of CHI. This will help determine which patients require a more detailed neuropsychologic assessment.", "PMC3907362": "The Leu-M1 antigen has been recently proposed as a valuable immunodiagnostic marker of the Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease and to be particularly helpful is distinguishing Hodgkin's disease from other lymphoproliferative disorders such as peripheral T-cell lymphomas. In this study, the authors examined paraffin-embedded tissue sections obtained from 38 patients with previously well-characterized T-cell neoplasms for the presence of the Leu-M1 antigen. The cases comprised a spectrum of T-cell malignancies and were divided into four broad clinicopathologic groups: lymphoblastic lymphoma/ leukemias (6), mature T-cell leukemias (3), peripheral T-cell lymphomas (11), and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (18), which included both mycosis fungoides and nonmycosis fungoides types. The neoplastic T cells in 19 patients (50%) expressed the Leu-M1 antigen. The proportion of Leu-M1-positive cells and the immunostaining pattern varied greatly among these cases but correlated with mature, postthymic stages of T-cell differentiation and activation. Of particular significance was the observation that the more pleomorphic neoplastic T cells, including Reed-Sternberg-like cells, exhibited an intense cytoplasmic and membranous staining pattern which was often indistinguishable from the immunostaining pattern observed in Hodgkin's disease. The authors conclude that Leu-M1 is not a specific immunodiagnostic marker of Hodgkin's disease and has limited value in distinguishing Hodgkin's disease from T-cell neoplasms which stimulate Hodgkin's disease morphologically.", "PMC3666032": "Differences in the reactivity and in the influence of the epithelium on responsiveness of canine 2nd and 3rd generation airway smooth muscle were examined. Epithelium-containing 3rd generation airways produced a greater maximum contraction and were more sensitive to methacholine and histamine, but not to KCl, than corresponding 2nd generation airways. Mechanical removal of the epithelium increased the sensitivity to methacholine and histamine in 2nd generation airways; there was also an increase in the maximum response elicited by histamine, but not by methacholine, in epithelium-free preparations. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity to or the maximum response elicited by histamine or methacholine in epithelium-containing and epithelium-free 3rd generation airways. Epithelium removal had no effect on KCl-induced responses in either airway region. The inhibitory effects of verapamil (1 microM) against KCl- and methacholine-induced responses were identical in preparations containing and lacking the epithelium. The results support the postulate of an epithelium-derived inhibitory factor modulating airway smooth muscle reactivity. Furthermore, the influence of the epithelium exhibits regional differences, being greater in larger airways.", "PMC3941021": "Immunohistochemical reactivity of mammary carcinomas with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to human milk fat globule (HMFG) membrane antigens was compared with the estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumors. Antibody III D 5 stained 55 of the 74 tumors studied, the reaction being of borderline intensity in 19 cases and unequivocally positive in 36 cases. The staining was always cytoplasmic; in addition occasional extracellular III D 5-positive secretory material was observed. Positive reactivity of the tumor with antibody III D 5 was significantly correlated with ER and/or PR content of the tumors. The presence of extracellular, III D 5-positive secretory material correlated to the ER but not to the PR status of the tumors.", "PMC3095777": "A 75-year-old man developed acute transient agranulocytosis. Hematologic data and course were suggestive of a toxic etiology. The patient had been admitted for pneumococcal septicemia and a polymicrobial abscess of the soft tissues of the left leg. At the time of diagnosis of the agranulocytosis, he had received 36 g ceftriaxone. The agranulocytosis resolved following discontinuation of ceftriaxone. This drug was, in all likeliness, responsible for the hematologic disorder. Renal failure occurred concomitantly with the agranulocytosis. Other similar cases have been reported. In view of these data, blood counts should be monitored in patients receiving prolonged courses of ceftriaxone.", "PMC3991326": "To evaluate the role of each nephron segment in renal ammoniagenesis, distribution of renal ammoniagenic activity along the nephron in control and acidotic rats was examined. We used our original aerobic incubation system and ammonia produced from glutamine in 7 defined segments of microdissected nephron was measured using the enzymatic cycling method. When ammonia production in the control was compared in each nephron segment, the highest specific activity of ammoniagenesis per mm tubular length and that per microgram protein were observed in the proximal straight tubule (PST) and the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, respectively. Chronic metabolic acidosis increased ammonia production per mm tubular length markedly in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) (+171%), moderately in the medullary collecting tubule (+123%) and PST (+77%), and slightly in the distal convoluted tubule (+52%), revealing that the highest activity of ammoniagenesis was located in PCT and PST in acidosis. These data indicate that proximal tubules have major roles in renal ammoniagenesis both in the control and in acidosis. From the early observation of glutaminase I isoenzyme distribution along the nephron, our data suggest that not only phosphate-dependent glutaminase but also phosphate-independent glutaminase may have important roles in renal ammoniagenesis.", "PMC2805469": "A prospective study was carried out to document the natural history of flexion contractures of the knee after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Thirty-five knees in 33 patients with TKA were followed for a mean duration of 55 weeks. In no case did the surgical procedure include excessive bony resection in order to correct a flexion contracture. Standard goniometric measurements were used to determine the knee flexion contractures preoperatively and postoperatively while the patient was anesthetized and at each successive follow-up visit. All preoperative and postoperative flexion contractures were less than 30 degrees. The mean fixed flexion deformity of the entire group preoperatively was 12.9 degrees; immediately postoperatively, 14.8 degrees; and at final follow-up, 2.9 degrees. No difference was found in the amount of flexion contracture present at final follow-up evaluation with respect to age or gender. The impression that fixed flexion contractures must be corrected at the time of arthroplasty has led to the intraoperative removal of excess bone from the distal femur and/or proximal tibia. The present findings indicate that knee flexion contractures can significantly improve after TKA. There appears to be little, if any indication for excessive removal of bone in an attempt to achieve intraoperative correction.", "PMC2230507": "A cadaveric study of age-related changes in the triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist in Hong Kong Chinese confirms the high incidence of tears with increasing age.

Twenty of 96 (21%) AICD patches distorted with time. (b) Thirty-six postoperative computed tomographic (CT) scans of asymptomatic patients revealed that pericardial fluid collections were frequent during the month after surgery but rare beyond that. Echocardiography was insensitive for these collections. CT also demonstrated dense fibrosis around some distorted patches, months after surgery. (c) Five other patients with pericardial infection had distorted patches, and the four studied with CT had fluid beneath their patches. (d) A case of constrictive pericarditis had distorted patches but was not diagnosed with CT.

All had elevated parathyroid hormone and calcium levels before the procedure. Using a technique previously described, with relatively large parathyroid grafts in the forearm, calcium levels were effectively reduced and maintained below the upper limit of the normal range (10.5 mg/dl). Only one patient had symptomatic hypocalcemia postoperatively. Phosphorous levels were also significantly reduced to more physiologic values. When necessary, the forearm autografts allowed simplified titration of calcium levels on an outpatient basis.", "PMC2831299": "The effects of arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on both oxidative and metabolic perturbation were studied in primary cultures of rat cerebral cortical astrocytes. In the presence of 0.1 mM arachidonic acid, the rate of the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) to nitroblue formazan (NBF) was stimulated from 0.65 +/- 0.10 to 1.43 +/- 0.15 and from 0.092 +/- 0.006 to 0.162 +/- 0.009 nmol/min/mg protein in intact and broken cell preparations, respectively. The rate of superoxide radical formation, as measured by the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-inhibitable NBT reduction was 0.042 nmol/mg protein in broken cells and was negligible in intact cells. The latter is due to the impermeability of SOD into the intact cell preparation. NBF formation in intact astrocytes stimulated by arachidonic acid was both time- and dose-dependent. Other PUFAs, including linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, were also effective in stimulating NBF formation in astrocytes, whereas saturated palmitic acid and monounsaturated oleic acid were ineffective. Similar effects of these PUFAs were observed in malondialdehyde formation in cells and lactic acid accumulation in incubation medium. These data indicate that both membrane integrity and cellular metabolism were perturbed by arachidonic acid and by other PUFAs. The sites of superoxide radical formation appeared to be intracellular and may be associated with membrane phospholipid domains, because liposome-entrapped SOD, which was taken up by intact astrocytes, reduced the level of superoxide radicals and lactic acid content, whereas free SOD was not effective.", "PMC3804952": "Method 8150, published in the second edition of Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Manual SW-846, required optimization, ruggedness testing, linearity determinations, precision tests, bias testing, gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric confirmation, and quality control guidelines for validation of the protocol.

Final ruggedness testing of the optimized procedure gave a mean recovery of 89.3% with a standard deviation of 4.3%. Percent relative standard deviations are less than 10 (n = 20, each analyte) over a 10(2) linear range of concentration for MCPP and MCPA and over a 10(3) linear range of concentration for the other target herbicide esters.

The cellular DNA content was measured by means of flow cytometry. Overall, DNA aneuploidy was seen in 43 of the cases (61%) while the normal gastric mucosa consisted of only a diploid line without any aneuploid population. Ploidy levels of gastric cancer spanned a wide range from a hypodiploid value to a hyperpentaploid value, although near-diploid and near-triploid cases were the majority in the series. No significant association between ploidy and either age or sex was found. The incidence of DNA aneuploidy was significantly higher in differentiated adenocarcinomas than in undifferentiated ones (p less than 0.05). However, DNA ploidy was not related to some pathologic characteristics such as the extent of tumor invasion and the frequency of lymph node metastasis. According to Kaplan-Meier survival plots, prognosis of the patients with DNA diploid tumors tended to be better than that of aneuploid tumors, but the difference was not statistically significant.", "PMC3029681": "A new procedure for the construction of linker scanning mutants is described. A plasmid containing the target DNA is randomly linearized and slightly shortened by a novel combination of established methods. After partial apurination with formic acid a specific nick or small gap is introduced at the apurinic site by exonuclease III, followed by nuclease S1 cleavage of the strand opposite the nick/gap. Synthetic linkers are ligated to the ends and plasmids having the linker inserted in the target DNA are enriched. Putative linker scanning mutants are identified by their topoisomer patterns after relaxation with topoisomerase I.

Such problems as lack of standard definitions for early and late PTE, the retrospective design of most studies, the wide variability of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the varied duration of follow-up make this body of literature extremely difficult to evaluate. Severe head trauma appears to cause injured neurons to become hyperexcitable; this in turn brings about the formation of an epileptogenic focus during the time between trauma and seizure occurrence. Both military and civilian head injury populations have been used to evaluate the incidence of PTE. Early seizures (i.e., less than 7 days) occur in approximately 3-5 percent of the head injury patients in both the military and civilian groups. Factors increasing this incidence include intracranial hematoma, focal neurologic deficits, posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) lasting greater than 24 hours, depressed skull fracture, and age less than 5 years. The incidence of late seizures is directly related to the extent of brain damage. The military population, composed primarily of cases with penetrating head injury, is associated with a late PTE incidence of approximately 30-50 percent. Closed head injuries in the military population involve a 5-15 percent seizure incidence. Late PTE incidence after head injuries in the civilian population is less than 5 percent. Risk factors associated with late PTE include loss of consciousness or PTA lasting greater than 24 hours, dural lacerations, depressed skull fractures, and various computerized tomography deficits. These factors vary slightly between the military and civilian populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2674928": "The authors hypothesized that donor primordial germ cells (PGC) are useful as vehicles of gene transfer in birds.

The percentages of PGC in these three embryonic sources were 2, .003 and 1.5%, respectively. The isolated PGC have been used as antigens to produce specific antibodies that have served as major tools in identification, isolation, and forming enriched in vitro cultures of PGC. Sterile hosts for normal donor PGC have been induced by use of ultraviolet irradiation, treatment with the chemical busulfan, and crossing rooster with female quail to form a sterile host termed \"quickens.\" Micromanipulator technology, along with refinement of techniques to avoid trauma, will allow 80% hatchability.

Conditionally stable artificial yeast chromosomes were constructed that contain an inducible GAL promoter upstream of ARS1. Under growth conditions in which the promoter was inactive, these chromosomes were mitotically stable; however, when the GAL promoter was induced, the chromosomes became extremely unstable as a result of transcriptional impairment of ARS function. This interference by the GAL promoter occurred only in cis but can occur from either side of ARS1. Transcriptional interference of ARS function can be monitored readily by using a visual colony-color assay (P. Hieter, C. Mann, M. Snyder, and R.W. Davis, Cell 40:381-392, 1985), which was further developed as a sensitive in vivo assay for sequences which rescue ARS from transcription. DNA fragments from the 3' ends of genes, inserted downstream of the GAL promoter, protected ARS function from transcriptional interference. This assay is expected to be independent of both RNA transcript stability and processing. Philippsen et al. have shown that transcription into a yeast centromere inhibits CEN function in vivo (L. Panzeri, I. Groth-Clausen, J. Shepard, A. Stotz, and P. Philippsen, Chromosomes Today 8:46-58, 1984). We identified two 200- to 300-base-pair DNA fragments flanking CEN4 that rescued ARS1 from transcription. Both of these fragments protected ARS from transcription when inserted in either orientation. The 3' ends of stable transcripts are encoded by fragments that protected the ARS from transcription, suggesting that the protection was achieved by transcription termination. It is suggested that protection of elements important for the replication and segregation of eucaryotic chromosomes from transcription is necessary for their proper function in vivo.", "PMC2180227": "During an observation period of 10 years 30 cases (11%) of twin transfusion syndrome were observed in a collective of 286 twin pregnancies at the University Women's Clinic Heidelberg. Typical symptoms of a twin transfusion syndrome as polyhydramnios, hydrops fetalis, polyserositis, disparity in fetal growth of the twins and pathological CTGs were examined for their diagnostic and prognostic values. A difference in birth weight of more than 25% was noted in only 28% of cases (range 2-58). A polyhydramnios was diagnosed in 63% of cases, an acute form in 30%. Eight of the nine pregnancies with an acute hydramnios ended in an abortion or intrauterine death up to 28 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis for reduction of the excessive amount of amniotic fluid had no positive therapeutic effect. Eight of the pregnancies, in which a hydramnios had been detected, were further complicated by a hydrops fetalis (23%). Typical sinusoidal CTGs were registered in only 3 cases. Intrauterine fetal mortality respectively abortion up to 28 weeks of gestation was noted in 6 patients (12/60; 20%). Fetal mortality after 28 weeks of gestation occurred in 9/60 cases (15%). Four infants died more than 7 days post partum (7%). The fetal malformation rate was determined in our collective with 7% (4/60 fetuses). No chromosomal abnormalities were observed. The data collected show the prognostic relevance of the parameters analysed and reveal the cases in which a therapy might be effective.

The transforming gene was present in 12 out of 18 cases. The Alu sequence was demonstrated in the tumor grown after injection of transfected NIH 3T3 cells from 10 patients. Among these 10 Alu sequences, the human N-ras oncogene was present in 3 cases. Analysis of nucleotide sequences of the exons of human N-ras oncogenes cloned from the tumors revealed a single point mutation of the codon encoding the 13th amino acid of exon 1 from guanine to cytosine in all 3 cases of MDS. A one-year follow-up study of these MDS cases showed that in the patients positive for the transforming gene, the disease state progressed from PARA, PASA to RAEB or from RAEB to acute leukemia in 6 out of 7 cases, while in the 6 negative patients, no change was observed in their disease states. It was considered that the mutation of the N-ras gene at the 13th amino acid codon of exon 1 was fairly specific to MDS and that presence of the transforming gene may be used for predicting the progress of the disease.", "PMC1557830": "A technique for immunoelectron microscopy is described whereby tissue is embedded in large (6 x 12 mm) plastic blocks and reembedded (\"popped off\") directly from semithin (3-microns) sections for thin sectioning.

[3H]GABA is accumulated in the glia of the nerve endings of the CI as well as the SETi; however, it is accumulated only in the terminal axons of the CI, not in the terminal axons of the SETi. The grain densities above the glia and above the CI terminal axons are approximately 2 grains/micron2. After incubation in [3H]glutamate the grain densities above the CI terminal axons and the SETi terminal axons are approximately 4 grains/micron2; the grain densities above the glia of both types of nerve endings are approximately 17 grains/micron2. The relatively high labeling (3 grains/micron2) of the muscles after incubation in the presence of glutamate is ascribed to the high metabolic requirements of slow muscles. The conclusion is drawn that a high-affinity uptake system for GABA is present in the CI terminal axons and in the glia of both the CI and SETi nerve endings. However, while the glutamate uptake in the CI and SETi nerve endings of the slow 135cd is comparable to the high-affinity uptake of glutamate in the fast excitor tibiae (FETi) nerve endings of the fast retractor unguis muscle, a high-affinity uptake of glutamate was only demonstrated in the glia of both types of nerve endings. A high-affinity uptake in the terminal axons of the CI and SETi may be masked by an extensively low-affinity uptake of glutamate by the muscles.", "PMC3429473": "This study tested the reaction of a periarticular tissue to implanted pericardial membrane, substituting a segment of patellar ligament. Bovine pericardium was chemically purified and cross-linked with monomeric glutaraldehyde under pH, temperature and time conditions minimizing the polymerization of the cross-linking agent. Eight rats had both knee joint patellar ligaments excised. One side served as a control (simple suture), the other dissected ligament was replaced with a strip of pericardium. After 18 days and 12 weeks the dissected ligaments were analyzed by morphological methods. An unexpected fast ingrowth of cells and vessels was observed at 18 days. At 12 weeks new collagen deposits within pericardial patch were seen with striking biodegradation of the implant.

The Analysis of Opiates in Blood. The Abbott TDx analyzer, which is marketed for the analysis of drugs in urine or serum, was applied to the detection and quantitation of total opiates in whole blood. The analysis was sensitive with a detection limit of about 30 ng/mL. The coefficient of variation in the determination was within 12% for the linear working range of 0-1000 ng/mL. The greatest merits of the method are speed and the small sample size. An analysis can be completed within 15 min and requires only 25 microL of sample. The method was applied to actual forensic cases and the results correlated well with derivative gas chromatography (r greater than 0.95). Interference effects of ethanol and dipipanone on the TDx measurements are reported. The method, similar to other immunoassays, is incapable of differentiating morphine and codeine. It was, however, shown to be a reliable screening technique. Part II. The Analysis of Opiates in Liver, Bile, and Urine. The Abbott TDx analyzer was applied to the detection and quantitation of total opiates in liver and bile without any sample pretreatment other than dilution with saline. No matrix effect was observed for liver. Bile matrices exerted negative interference, but this was overcome by a standard addition method. The analysis was sensitive with a detection limit of about 55 ng/g for liver. The detection limit for biles varied according to the extent of negative interference that the matrices exerted, but it was in the submicrogram per milliliter region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3729179": "The effect of imidazole, a thromboxane A2 inhibitor, in endotoxin shock in dogs was studied. Thromboxane A2 is a vasoconstrictor and enhances platelet and neutrophil aggregation. The purpose of this study was to examine the hemodynamic modifications of endotoxin shock with imidazole. Thirty dogs were studied, all receiving 1 X 10(8) live Escherichia coli/kg over a 30-minute period. The dogs were divided into three groups of ten dogs each. The first group received no treatment. The second group received a concomitant infusion of imidazole 25 mg/kg per hour. In a third group the imidazole infusion was delayed for 1 hour after the E. coli infusion. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were measured at 30-minute intervals. Hemoglobin (HGB), white blood count (WBC), a-A gradient (a-A grad), A-V 02 difference (AV02 diff), and fluid requirements were measured at 60-minute intervals. The endotoxin shock response in untreated control dogs was characterized by significant changes over time in MAP and SVR (decreased), and CO and a-A grad (increased). The imidazole group was significantly different, as the MAP and SVR did not decrease and the CO did not increase as in the control group. The control group required significantly more fluids than the imidazole group, while the HGB remained stable suggesting more capillary permeability in the control group. The delayed treatment group was statistically similar to the control animals. These data suggest that imidazole significantly modifies the hemodynamic response to endotoxin shock and may reduce the associated capillary permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC4381896": "Radioactive choline is incorporated by pneumococcus (strain R36A) into a polymeric substance from which it can be quantitatively recovered as free choline, after hydrolysis by strong acid.

[3H]Methionine was infused into a lateral cerebral ventricle, and 3H-labelled PC was isolated from brains of rats 0.1-18 h after the infusions. Three major subspecies of this PC, differing in their fatty acid compositions, were separated on silver-impregnated t.l.c. plates, and the proportions of radioactivities in these three PC fractions were determined. The results indicate that newly-formed PC synthesized by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine at 0.1 h after [3H]methionine contains a significantly higher proportion of polyunsaturated subspecies (i.e. those with six or four double bonds) than does PC obtained later times after injection of [3H]methionine. This change in the composition of 3H-labelled brain PC occurs gradually and is not due to an influx of radioactive PC from the periphery. Our data suggest that polyunsaturated PC (hexaenes and tetraenes) produced in the brain by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine turns over faster than does that containing more-saturated fatty acids.", "PMC3488238": "In embryos of the frog Xenopus laevis, the dorsal structures normally develop from regions of the egg opposite the side of sperm entry. Gravity and centrifugal force, applied at an angle of 90 degrees to the animal-vegetal axis of the egg, can override this topographic relationship and can cause the dorsal structures to be positioned according to the force vector (S. Black and J. Gerhart, 1985, Dev. Biol. 108, 310-324). We report here that at time 0.40 (40% of the first cleavage interval), an average of 60% of eggs centrifuged at 30g for 4 min in this orientation form conjoined twins with one body axis arising from the centripetal side of the egg and one arising from the centrifugal side of the egg. This positioning is observed regardless of the orientation of the side of sperm entry in the centrifugal field. If, after the 0.40 centrifugation, the eggs are inclined with the centripetal side up, they do not make twins; instead, they make only a single axis at the centripetal side. This indicates that the second axis in twins is caused to form by postcentrifugation gravity-driven internal rearrangements of materials that were displaced by the centrifugation. Twins also form at high frequency in eggs centrifuged twice, first at an inclination of 90 degrees, and then at an inclination of 0 degrees. The second centrifugation yields secondary axes even when it is begun midway in the second cell cycle, well after the time of grey crescent formation. Double centrifugation also causes twinning (\"double rescue\") of uv-irradiated eggs which otherwise would not develop axial structures. This suggests that the internal displacements caused by the centrifugations can substitute for a step in the normal axis specification process that is impaired in irradiated eggs.", "PMC3390167": "Open field behaviour and thirst motivated running through two labyrinth variants were compared before and after bilateral symmetric lesions of the anterior part of the dorsolateral parabrachial nucleus (PBl) and in the anterior mesencephalic area cuneiformis (CU), both n = 9, on 4-month-old male Long-Evans rats. CU-rats were characterized by abolished visual placing responses, aphagia or hypophagia which was limited up to the 15th postoperative day, ambulatory hyperactivity, reduced climbing and grooming, but enhanced rearing. Their preoperatively learnt thirst motivated labyrinth passage remained unimpaired but their drinking behaviour was persistently changed. They interrupted drinking several times and regularly did not empty the cups. Thirst motivation was evidently reduced after CU-lesions. PBl-rats were ambulatory hypoactive and slowed with accelerated habituation, reduced climbing and changed incline-plane behaviour. A slight hypophagia was generally overcome after the 5th postoperative day. Labyrinth performance of PBl-rats was evidently changed with significantly slower runs and impaired differentiation of the second labyrinth type in which passage duration, errors and even duration of licking were enhanced. Water intake was less reduced than in CU-rats.

The increasing problems associated with various types of NRE exposures (recycling of waste materials, energy-efficient dwellings) and the continuously increasing use of ionizing radiation in medical practices (x-ray and nuclear diagnostic examinations) require a revision of the present radiation protection concept.

In a randomized, single-blind trial, we have evaluated the effects of PGI2, a natural compound with strong vasodilator and anti-platelet activities, in 14 patients presenting with Raynaud's phenomenon. The patients received a 24-hour infusion of either PGI2 in doses of 10 mg/kg.min, or only the solvent (glycine buffer). All patients recorded the frequency and severity of the attacks before and after treatment, and 7 of the 8 patients who received the solvent benefited from a PGI2 infusion 30 to 60 days later. Among the 14 patients (6 men, 8 women), 10 had underlying collagen disease. The number of attacks per week was initially 15.9 +/- 5.3 (mean +/- s.e.). The resulting impairment was pronounced (+ + on a + to + + + scale). Radioimmunoassays of prostaglandins showed a strong increase in 6-keto PGF1 alpha levels during the infusion, without changes in thromboxane levels. A significant (p less than 0.05) reduction was observed in the number of attacks (2.6 +/- 2.5 per week) and in impairment (+ on average after PGI2 but not after the buffer). Improvement after PGI2 lasted from 0.5 to 12 months, and all but one patient regarded the treatment as effective in long-term, despite undesirable side-effects (flush, hypotension) which occurred regularly during PGI2 infusion.

Proteins in cultured cells were labeled with [35S]methionine. Labeling of the intracellular GP-87 pool was effected during 16 hours prior to LHRH (10(-7) M) stimulation. Proteins were analyzed either by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Medium content) or by two-dimensional PAGE (Cell content). An apparent half-life (intracellular catabolism + release) of 31 h for GP-87 was estimated from control cells; it dropped to 2.5 h in stimulated cells due to intense release (26% after 1 h and about 80% after 8 h of stimulation). When cells were simultaneously labeled and stimulated, the newly synthesized species appeared in the medium after a lag phase of 30 minutes, time required for synthesis and full subsequent processing. From both series of experiments, it is concluded that the hypothalamic decapeptide promotes exocytosis of the newly synthesized GP-87 well before the endogenous GP-87 pool is exhausted. Furthermore, the release of another discrete protein (B2, Mr: 81 kDa) is also stimulated by LHRH.

The pharmacologic hypogonadotropism allows considerable flexibility with respect to the timing of starting gonadotropin stimulation and ovulation induction. In 74 Buserelin/hMG/IVF-cycles no premature luteinization occurred and all started stimulations yielded in follicular puncture. In addition increased oocyte recovery rate, significant higher fertilization rate and significant better pregnancy rate could be achieved as compared with hMG/IVF-cycles.

Pulse-chase labeling shows that SGP-1 is synthesized as a cotranslationally glycosylated 67-kilodalton (kDa) precursor which is posttranslationally modified to a 70-kDa form before secretion to the extracellular space. A plasmid cDNA library was constructed from immunopurified mRNA, and two overlapping clones coding for the entire protein coding sequence were isolated. The cDNAs represent 27 nucleotides of 5' noncoding sequence, 1554 nucleotides of coding sequence, and 594 nucleotides of 3' noncoding sequence. The derived SGP-1 sequence contains 554 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 61,123. Four potential N-glycosylation sites occur within the sequence. An internal region of SGP-1 shows 78% sequence identity with the 67 N-terminal amino acids described for human sulfatide/GM1 activator (SAP-1). Sequence comparisons suggest that SGP-1 is the precursor to sulfatide/GM1 activator; however, the secretion of the protein from Sertoli cells is distinct from the proteolytic processing and lysosomal compartmentalization which have been described for human fibroblasts. The presence of internal sequence similarity suggests that three additional binding sites may occur in SGP-1.

In the first and second experiment chick embryos were cooled for 6 hr/day to 30 degrees C from day 11 till 14 and from day 15 till 18 respectively, whereas control groups were incubated throughout at 37.8 degrees C. In both experiments the thyroxine (T4) response upon TRH in 19 day-old embryos was higher in the previously cold treated embryos, according to the percentages of increase.

In a third experiment the T4 response to TRH injection immediately and 3 and 8 days after a temperature treatment (25 degrees C or 12 degrees C) for one week on four weeks old broiler chickens was found to be similar in both temperature groups. In all experiments there was a concomitant triiodothyronine (T3) increase after TRH injection, but differences between experimental groups were observed at days 15 and 19 of incubation and immediately after the postnatal temperature treatment.

In whole blood platelet shape is normal for HGPS, but in PRP for 10 of 16 patients with HGPS there is a decrease in the proportion of smooth, discoid-shaped platelets (discocytes [D]). The platelets of all patients with HGPS had abnormally large mean volume (VT) and increased size on peripheral blood smear. Furthermore, 12 of 16 patients with HGPS, including six of seven donors with BSS, had abnormally large discocytes. The measured size of HGPS shape-changed platelets was compared with the size predicted from the size of the D by assuming that the relationship between the size of shape-changed platelets and D was the same as observed for normal donors. In this manner it was shown that for all donors with BSS and MPS, the shape-changed platelets are disproportionately larger than the D. In contrast, in the remaining patients with HGPS the size of the shape-changed platelets was consistent with the size predicted from the D. Examination of VT for MPS as a function of time after addition of 10 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate to PRP revealed an abnormal time course, thereby pointing to an abnormality in the mechanisms that regulate platelet size during shape change. With the lone exceptions of BSS and MPS, the size of platelets on blood smear was well correlated with the total platelet plasma membrane surface area as measured by the osmotic spherocyte method. Our observations point to two distinct abnormalities in platelet size in HGPS: a disproportion between the size of D and \"shape-changed\" platelets, which may be related to an abnormal shape change and which is observed only for MPS and BSS, and an abnormal increase in platelet size on blood smear, which appears to reflect the increased amount of platelet plasma membrane in other HGPS platelets.", "PMC4014317": "The purposes of this work were 1) to reparameterize the likelihood used in segregation analysis in a way particularly suited to detecting heterogeneity (the result of the analysis is a parameter giving the proportion of families with the genetic form of the disease in the dataset) and 2) to test how well this reparameterization works using simulation. We assume that a dataset contains nuclear family data, with some of the families having a form of the disease that is environmentally caused and the others with a genetic form of the disease. In this study, we considered the case where the genetic form is a simple recessive and the environmental form a random model. The underlying parameters were the gene frequency, q, and the frequency of sporadics, R. We reparameterized the likelihood in terms of alpha, the percentage of genetic families in the dataset, which we attempt to estimate. We contrast the estimates of alpha with the population heterogeneity as reflected in the estimates of q and R. For the simulation, nuclear families are generated. Genetic families were simulated with a mendelian recessive pattern and environmental families according to a simple random model. Over a wide range of generating parameters, estimates of alpha were good, differing from the \"true\" values by only a few percent. Estimates of q and R, on the other hand, ranged from fair to poor.

It hardly hydrolyzed casein below 50 degrees C, but in the presence of 5 M urea it showed relatively high activity at 30 degrees C. The activity was completely stable at 50 degrees C for 1 hr. 3. The activity seems to be contained in a high mol. wt (450,000) protein from the elution volume and is due to cysteine proteinase from the effect of inhibitors. 4. The above properties agreed with those of the heat-stable alkaline proteinase (HAP) of fish purified homogeneously by electrophoresis. This seems to suggest that HAP may also exist in rat skeletal muscle.", "PMC3680302": "A murine encephalopathic syndrome can be induced by the administration of BSA and whole-cell pertussis vaccine.

The strength of the antibody response to the sensitizer appeared to be more important than the H-2 type of the recipient in determining the susceptibility of different mouse strains.

In Experiment 1, ability to recognize the final sequence was examined as a function of redundancy at the levels of musical structure in a sequence, contour complexity of transpositions in a trial, and trial context in a session. Within a sequence, tones were related as the major or augmented triad; within a trial, the four sequences began on successively higher notes (simple macrocontour) or on randomly selected notes (complex macrocontour); and within a session, trials were either blocked (all major or all augmented) or mixed (major and augmented randomly selected). Performance was superior for major melodies, for systematic transpositions within a trial (simple macrocontours), for blocked trials, and for musically trained listeners. In Experiment 2, we examined further the effect of macrocontour. Performance on simple macrocontours exceeded that on complex, and excluded the possibility that repetition of the 20-note sequences provided the entire benefit of systematic transposition in Experiment 1. The effect of musical structure (major/augmented) was also replicated. In Experiment 3, listeners provided structure ratings of ascending 20-note sequences from Experiment 2. Ratings on same trials were higher than those on corresponding different trials, in contrast to performance scores for augmented same and different trials in previous experiments. The concept of functional uncertainty was proposed to account for recognition difficulties on augmented same trials. The significant effects of redundancy on all the levels examined confirm the utility of the information-processing framework for the study of melodic sequence perception.", "PMC2859093": "Neurons located in the medial septum-nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (vertical limb) and antidromically activated by electrical stimulation of the fimbria were recorded in urethane anesthetized rats. Forty-three percent of these septohippocampal neurons (SHNs) were excited by the iontophoretic application of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Rhythmically bursting SHNs were more often excited (63%) by TRH than the non-bursting SHNs (35%). The majority of the TRH-sensitive SHNs could also be excited by cholinergic agonists. TRH-induced excitations were not abolished by the simultaneous application of atropine. Potentiation by TRH of acetylcholine, carbachol or glutamate-induced excitations of SHNs were rarely observed. Cyclo (His-Pro) and (3-Me-His2)-TRH were observed to have similar, although less dramatic, effects.

Immunohistochemical stainings indicate that neurofibromas contain types I, III, IV, and V collagens and fibronectin. Most of the neurofibroma cells are type IV collagen and S-100 protein positive, which provides immunohistochemical evidence that neurofibromas are mostly composed of Schwann cell-like cells. The proteoglycan/collagen ratio is 4 to 10 times higher in the neurofibromas than in the surrounding dermal tissue. This would explain the typical soft consistency of the neurofibromas and may contribute to a favorable milieu for tumor growth.

This release was completely inhibited by cycloheximide and is, therefore, directly related to de novo protein synthesis. The endothlin-induced release was further stimulated by adrenaline. Adrenaline-induced stimulation was completely inhibited by the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine and was not inhibited by the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Cycloheximide completely prevented the adrenaline-stimulated as well as the basal release. These results suggest that cultured endothelial cells release endothelin slowly but continuously and that this release can be stimulated by adrenaline via alpha-adrenergic receptors.

Poverty, single parent households and adolescent pregnancies are not exclusively female problems. The role that males play has been missing from too many studies of these phenomena. In light of the fact that most sexual activity is male initiated, and most sexual behavior is male influenced, it becomes clear that there will be no resolution of the problem of teenage pregnancy without directing greater attention to the male. The issue of male responsibility is skirted too often due to parental pride on the part of mothers and fathers when their male children seek sexual relations with female partners. It is viewed as a sign that they are developing sexually within the norm. This is especially true, in many instances, in female headed households where the mother is concerned that she may not be providing her son with an adequate male role model. Sexual activity by female adolescents, however, is generally not condoned. This confusing double standard is further compounded by the disjointed fashion in which American society responds to adolescent sexuality on the whole. Although the home should be the focal point, many parents reluctantly admit an inability to communicate effectively about sex with their pre-adolescent children. Thus, the school, church, community and social agencies have all been enlisted in this task. The National Urban League's initiative in this area is expected to have significant impact on the course of adolescent sexuality and reproductive responsibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3435397": "The demographic model of senescence described here provides an answer to the question, \"Why should senescence evolve?\" Most generally stated, the answer is that senescence should be expected to evolve if its negative effect on the rate of natural increase of a nonsenescent population is sufficiently offset by the early appearance of an advantageous characteristic. This is a nonadaptive point of view in the sense discussed by Kirkwood (1985) and by Kirkwood and Cremer (1982). It corresponds more closely to Medawar's (1952) position than to Weisman's (1889). The demographically based model in which senescence is represented by sudden death supplies an explanation which is simple and credible for the evolution of senescence. It supports the following specific conclusions: 1. The introduction of sudden death (case 2) in a nonsenescent population otherwise subject only to randomly occurring death (case 1) is, by itself, disadvantageous from the standpoint of natural selection. 2. However the population may enjoy a net selective advantage if the disadvantage of sudden-death senescence is compensated by an appropriate improvement early in its life history, e.g., by a reduction in its presenescent death rate. 3. In the most extreme example possible, in which the presenescent death rate is zero and the survival curve is rectangular (case 3), the early improvement is associated with an increase in the degree of sensescence of the population, in its mean longevity, and in its average age at death. Thus natural selection can simultaneously favor both senescence and longevity. 4. Among populations in which the age of sudden death is balanced against the presenescent death rate in such a way that mean longevity is held constant (case 4), sudden-death senescence provides selective advantage relative to a nonsenescent population (case 1). Up to the point at which the survival curve becomes rectangular, the earlier the age at which sudden-death occurs, the greater the selective advantage. Similar conclusions were reached earlier with respect to forms of senescence which take effect more gradually than the sudden-death mechanism postulated here. 5. Populations in which the age of sudden death is balanced against the presenescent death rate in such a way that the average age at death is held constant (case 5) are selectively neutral with respect to a nonsenescent population (case 1). Thus a reduction in mortality at a nearly age can compensate for the sudden death of the whole population at an advanced age because so few individuals in the nonsenescent population survive to reproduce when old.", "PMC3049214": "Duplex ultrasound was used to evaluate the effects of 350-cal, 300-ml protein, fat, carbohydrate, and mixed (Ensure-Plus) liquid meals on celiac, superior mesenteric, and femoral artery blood flow in 7 healthy volunteers.

Duplex parameters of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, mean velocity, and volume flow were determined before, and serially for 90 min after, ingestion of each test meal. Maximal changes were compared with baseline values. There were no significant changes in any of the blood flow parameters derived from the celiac or femoral arteries after any test meal ingested. In contrast, maximal changes in all superior mesenteric artery parameters were increased significantly over baseline (p less than 0.05) after each of the test meals except water, with end-diastolic velocity showing proportionally the greatest increase.

To probe the effects of this fatty acid, AA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids were exogenously provided in Ca2+-free medium to avoid the formation of insoluble or impermeant Ca2+-arachidonate complexes. Concentrations of AA of greater than or equal to 3 microM induced potent and sustained but reversible 45Ca efflux from prelabeled intact (or digitonin-permeabilized) islets; AA also induced insulin release at somewhat higher concentrations. Other unsaturated fatty acids (erucic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, dihomo-gamma-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic acids) were generally less active than AA itself, indicating a structure-function relationship. The effects of AA were saturable, were inhibitable by cooling, and were not accompanied in parallel by 51Cr release or trypan blue retention, suggesting a nontoxic mechanism. At low concentrations (3.3-16 microM), at which AA does not stimulate insulin release, AA-induced 45Ca efflux was not reduced by pretreatment with ionomycin (to deplete membrane-bound Ca2+ stores), suggesting stimulation of Ca2+ extrusion through the plasma membrane. At higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 25 microM), at which AA promotes insulin release, further Ca2+ efflux was stimulated, which was blunted by pretreatment with ionomycin (as well as by trifluoperazine). Conversely, pretreatment with AA obliterated the effects of ionomycin (3 microM) on cellular Ca2+ mobilization. Thus, AA also mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular organelles, leading to a rise in free cytosolic Ca2+ (as previously reported). AA-induced 45Ca efflux and insulin release were independent of the presence of extracellular Na+ and did not require the oxygenation of AA. Dose-response curves comparing 45Ca efflux and insulin secretion suggested that AA also stimulates hormone release by at least one other mechanism in addition to Ca2+ mobilization. This second stimulatory effect of AA could be seen in digitonin-permeabilized islets, where changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration were vitiated by EGTA-containing buffers. Such secretion was also saturable and was inhibited by cooling or by spermine (which inhibits protein kinase C in the islet). Furthermore, AA-induced secretion from either intact or permeabilized islets was blunted by prolonged pretreatment of islets with a phorbol ester to deplete them of protein kinase C. Thus, exogenous arachidonic acid seems to be a complete secretagogue, having stimulatory effects both on Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+-related secretory processes, putatively the activation of protein kinase C.", "PMC3665241": "Ten of 64 patients reviewed with scaphoid nonunion were found to have scapholunate gaps (SLG).

In the hypodermis and gill of the Crustacea fructose 1,6-diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) functions at a primary branch point between glycogen and chitin synthesis. In these tissues of the Arctic king-crab, Paralithodes camtchatica, fructose diphosphatase occurs in two electrophoretically distinguishable forms. 2. Fructose diphosphatase I (pI7.2-7.5) accounts for 70 and 10% of total fructose diphosphatase activity in the hypodermis and gill respectively, whereas fructose diphosphatase II (pI5.3) accounts for 30 and 90% of the total activity in the two tissues. Both forms display a neutral pH optimum, have an absolute requirement for a bivalent cation, and are potently inhibited by high concentrations of AMP and substrate. 3. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate saturation follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics for both fructose diphosphatases; the K(m) (fructose diphosphate) for fructose diphosphatase I is somewhat higher than for fructose diphosphatase II. In the presence of 50-200mm-K(+), the K(m) (fructose diphosphate) increases and at high concentrations of K(+) fructose diphosphate saturation follows sigmoidal kinetics. 4. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucose at high concentrations specifically and potently inhibit fructose diphosphatase II, but do not significantly affect fructose diphosphatase I activity. 5. Low concentrations of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine activate fructose diphosphatase II by a decrease in the apparent K(m) (fructose diphosphate), but fructose diphosphatase I is again refractory to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine under these conditions. 6. In the presence of K(+) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, fructose diphosphatase II is able to compete for limiting fructose diphosphate about three times more effectively than is fructose diphosphatase I. 7. AMP inhibition of both forms of the enzyme is subject to three independent variables: (a) alkaline pH increases the K(i) (AMP), (b) K(+) decreases the K(i), increases the sigmoidicity of inhibition kinetics, increases the maximum inhibition attained, and abolishes the effect of pH on AMP inhibition, and (c) Mg(2+) strongly de-inhibits AMP-inhibited fructose diphosphatase. 8.

Sodium uptake and potassium release were agonist-dependent, concentration-dependent, and stereoselective, with the following rank order of maximum ion movement: muscarinic agonists greater than histamine greater than substance P = serotonin. Potassium depolarization did not initiate sodium uptake or potassium release. Sodium uptake was rapid and monophasic, preceding potassium release which was biphasic in nature. Full muscarinic agonists produced equal maximal increases in sodium uptake, while maximal potassium release varied for all muscarinic agonists and in addition differed from sodium uptake in the following ways: time course, stereoselectivity, sensitivity to calcium antagonists, modulation by the guanylyl nucleotide derivative, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), and inhibition by muscarinic receptor blockade with benzilylcholine mustard. The calcium ionophores A23187 and ionomycin (SQ23377) did not produce any sodium uptake; A23187 but not ionomycin produced potassium release comparable to that evoked by muscarinic agonists. Ion movement in response to combinations of agonists were not additive. Muscarinic agonist binding as measured by competition for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) binding, was best described by multiple sites and was regulated by Gpp(NH)p. Excellent correlations were observed between the dissociation constants for binding and sodium uptake, potassium release, and contraction. The best correlations were those between the pharmacologic responses and the high affinity binding site in the absence, and the low affinity site in the presence, of Gpp(NH)p, respectively. Furthermore, the potencies of muscarinic agonists to evoke ion movements and to inhibit [3H]QNB binding were similar, and from one to two orders of magnitude less than those for contraction. It is suggested that contraction and potassium release were mediated by the high affinity, and sodium uptake by the low and average affinity muscarinic agonist binding sites, respectively. These findings suggest an agonist-activated receptor-effector coupling model in GPLM that leads to the activation of sodium uptake, potassium release, and subsequently, contraction.", "PMC3690534": "Fourteen patients with malignant carcinoid tumors were treated with rDNA alfa 2b interferon by sc injection three times per week.

The spores with bands at both 1.240 and 1.340 g/ml were germinable faster than the original dormant spores and thus were considered to be activated. The spores with a band at 1.240 g/ml, which were considered to be fully activated, were apparently permeabilized, with a resulting complete depletion of dipicolinic acid, partial depletion of minerals, susceptibility to lysozyme action, permeation of the gradient medium, changed structural appearance in electron micrographs of thin-sectioned spores, and partly decreased heat resistance (D100 = 453 min) compared with the original dormant spores (D100 = 760 min). However, the fully activated spores with a band at 1.240 g/ml, although devoid of dipicolinic acid, still were much more resistant than germinated spores or vegetative cells (D100 = 0.1 min). The spores with a band at 1.340 g/ml, which were considered to be partly activated, showed no evidence of permeabilization and were much more heat resistant (D100 = 1,960 min) than the original dormant spores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3474659": "The liver is an important target for potential gene therapy because of the critical role it plays in intermediary metabolism and synthesis of serum proteins. We report the use of retroviral vectors for transfer of recombinant genes into primary mouse hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were grown in a defined serum-free medium and expressed liver-specific functions for up to 14 days. Hepatocytes were transformed to Genticin (G418) resistance by infection with recombinant retroviruses carrying the Tn5 neomycin-resistance gene. The G418-resistant cells exhibited characteristic hepatocyte morphology and continued to express liver-specific gene function. A retrovirus that expresses neomycin resistance driven by a herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter produced the most efficient transformation compared with viruses using the retroviral long terminal repeat promoter or the simian virus 40 early-region promoter. These experiments indicate that primary hepatocytes can be successfully cultured and transformed with recombinant genes using retroviral vectors. These results provide a model for future somatic gene replacement therapy in which functional genes can be introduced into hepatocytes by viral-mediated gene transfer.", "PMC2935968": "Heparin is known to affect platelet function in vitro, but little is known about the effect of heparin on the interaction of platelets with polymer surfaces in general, and vascular graft materials in particular. For this reason, the effect of heparin vs. citrate anticoagulation on the interaction of platelets with the vascular graft materials expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), Dacron Bionit (DB) and preclotted Dacron Bionit (DB/PC) was studied in a recirculating, in vitro perfusion system. Platelet activation, as shown by a decrease in platelet count, an increase in platelet release and a decrease in platelet aggregation, was observed for all vascular graft materials tested using heparin and was greater for Dacron and preclotted Dacron than for ePTFE. Significant differences between heparin and citrate anticoagulation were seen for platelet release, platelet aggregation and the relative ranking of material platelet-reactivity. However, the trends and time course of platelet activation were similar with both heparin and citrate for the materials tested.", "PMC5021969": "Standard procedures have been described for measuring paramyxovirus-induced hemolysis. The choice of these procedures is based on the analysis of the behavior of eight different strains of Newcastle disease virus. Significant strain-specific differences in hemolytic activity have been found. The presence of at least two kinds of inhibitors of hemolysis in virus preparations necessitates the use of purified virus when comparisons of hemolytic activities are to be made. In addition, it has been stressed that both hemagglutination titers and hemolysis determinations provide only relative values.

However, considerable variations in the accuracy of detecting bladder tumours exist in published work on the subject. In this study the influence of concomitant urothelial atypia on urinary cytology was investigated. Further, the correlation of grading between cytology and tumour histology was examined, and finally the role of urinary cytology as a prognostic factor was investigated. 102 comparative studies of simultaneously achieved precystoscopic voided urine samples, tumour histology and 8 pre-selected site biopsies were available from patients having a Ta, T1 or T2 bladder tumour. The overall numbers of positive cytology were found to be 64%, but correcting for false positives caused by concomitant urothelial atypia the numbers were reduced to 55% (p less than 0.01). A considerable higher ability to detect high-grade than low-grade tumours was found. Correlation between grading of tumour histology and cytology was found to be only 50%. Patients were followed for 3 years. From the results of pre-cystoscopic cytology it was possible to define a low-risk group and a high-risk group. Patients with negative cytology had very low risk of future invasive tumour recurrence whereas all patients with grade III-IV cytologic changes were found to harbour either a grade III tumour or carcinoma in situ, both conditions predictive of aggressive tumour course.", "PMC2635932": "We report a 57-year-old patient who developed a significant stenosis in a proximal anastomosis after CABG.

At baseline before therapy, all patients had inducible VT by programmed stimulation (1 to 3 extrastimuli) and frequent (at least 30/hour) ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) during Holter monitoring. Mexiletine therapy was effective by programmed stimulation (VT no longer inducible or 15 or less beats) in 8 and ineffective in 27 patients. Twenty patients were discharged with mexiletine (14 of whom took an additional class IA agent). The discharge regimen was effective by programmed stimulation in 6 of these 20 patients. In 14 patients the discharge regimen was ineffective by programmed stimulation, but all patients had a marked reduction of ventricular ectopic activity (at least 83% reduction of VPCs and abolition of non sustained VT).

In ten pregnant patients (around the 35th week of gestation), over 700 measurements of systolic/diastolic action in the uterine vessels were made by Doppler sonography with the patients in various positions: lying down, standing, and sitting on the couch and the balance-variable chair; from the relationship between the systolic and diastolic levels conclusions were then drawn about the uterine blood flow in various body positions. It was found that it was best when the patient was lying down or sitting on the special chair without angling the hips; in contrast, diastole was lower in relation to systole with the patient standing and sitting on the examination couch. This means an increase in resistance or a reduction in blood flow. It appears reasonable to conclude that sitting on the balance-variable chair can be recommended to pregnant patients with signs of deficient fetal blood supply, in addition to bedrest, which is customarily advised.

When administered to rats as a single i.p. dose, the drug is presently shown to have the same in vitro effect. Maximal inhibition is seen 2 hr after administration, but at this time the brain concentrations of intact drug, although peaking, appear too low (ca. 11 micrograms/g tissue) to account for the intensity of the effect seen in vitro. This suggests in vivo activation to a metabolic intermediate forming a complex with cerebral cytochrome P-450, which 2 hr after dosing is fully insensitive to stiripentol added to incubates. Restoration of enzymic activity and of sensitivity to added stiripentol occurs progressively and is practically complete 24 hr after dosing.", "PMC3801471": "The effect of lidocaine was examined in membrane vesicles from rabbit renal brush borders.

At low lidocaine concentrations, there was a saturable decrease in permeability, whereas at higher concentrations (greater than 0.2 mM) there was a non-saturable general increase in cation permeability.

Similar incubation of the double-labeled molecule with K562 cells did not lead to the dissociation of the two labels.

We prospectively reviewed 186 consecutive patients undergoing BMT from 1976 to 1986 to determine incidence and type of liver disease after BMT and predisposing factors. Two of 186 patients experienced VOD (1.07%). Acute and chronic liver GVHD were found in 25.8% and 36% of the patients, respectively. Acute hepatitis (AH) was diagnosed in 29.4% and chronic hepatitis (CH) in 42.6% of the patients. Statistical analysis showed no influence of pretransplant variables on the occurrence of acute GVHD and AH; there was a weak correlation (P = 0.01) between pre-BMT abnormal transaminases and occurrence of chronic GVHD. Contingency table and Cox analysis showed a greater risk of CH for patients with abnormal pretransplant SGPT levels (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0022). No other variables could be associated with posttransplant CH. Actuarial survival was 71% versus 69% for patients with normal versus abnormal transaminases (P = 0.2). As VOD was a rare event, despite 53% of patients having abnormal transaminase values before transplant, we suggest that a lower and slower TBI is more important than pretransplant normal transaminases in preventing this complication.

All cell lines demonstrated PLDR which was considerably higher for all the cell lines in plateau phase compared to log phase. At survival levels of 0.01, the two fibroblast lines had recovery ratios of 3.8 and 4.0 for 6 h delayed plating in plateau phase. The malignant lines showed recovery ratios of 5.7 (neuroblastoma), 3.2 (breast carcinoma) and 2.4 (colon carcinoma). The data were fitted to the linear quadratic equation and in addition, a repair factor was developed to compare survival for immediate and delayed plating: S(D) = exp[-gamma (alpha D + beta D2)] where gamma = 1 for immediate plating. Previously published data on human tumor and normal lines were also fitted to this equation. In all instances the three parameter equation (alpha, beta, gamma) allowed a good fit of the survival data for immediate and delayed plating. By using the same alpha, beta for the zero hour and 6 h survival curves, the gamma factor allows a much more useful method of comparing PLDR among different cell lines. The gamma factor for the two lung fibroblast lines were 0.70 and 0.71 while skin fibroblasts also had a 0.71 factor. The six malignant lines ranged from 0.62 to 0.93 with all but the neuroblastoma line having a higher factor (and therefore decreased PLDR capacity) than the normal lines.

These data were analysed using the principle of linked functions. Spectrin binds exclusively to the filamentous form of actin, and thereby stabilizes F-actin with respect to the G-form. The decrease in the critical concentration for actin polymerization, in the presence of spectrin, has been shown to be consistent with an equilibrium constant for the binding of spectrin to individual promoters within F-actin of approximately 8 X 10(5) M-1 at 23 degrees C, and an ionic strength of 7 mM.", "PMC3082857": "The growth of Escherichia coli strains in media having elevated osmolarity was promoted in the presence of low concentrations of the L-proline analog 5-hydroxy-L-pipecolic acid.

The results suggest that the proP-mediated transport of L-proline (in addition to that by proU) is important in osmoregulation. proP::lac operon fusions were used to demonstrate that this gene shows limited induction of expression upon growth in media having elevated osmolarity and that it is transcribed clockwise on the chromosome.", "PMC3302876": "Ofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent in vitro activity against N. gonorrhoeae. 32 adult males with acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis were treated with a single-dose of orally administered ofloxacin (400 mg). 1 out of 32 isolates was penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae.

Beginning 6 days after each host had received a single allograft, each was injected subcutaneously twice daily with 4 micrograms GHRH in 100 microliter of vehicle or 100 microliter of vehicle for 16 days. Six hosts in each group were killed by decapitation on day 17, 16 h after the last injection. Nine normal male hamsters were also decapitated and their pituitary glands were removed. Sections of anterior pituitary tissue were stained for GH and with hematoxylin. The percentage of anterior pituitary cells that stained for growth hormone was similar in the 3 groups. In contrast, somatotrophs in grafts had a smaller mean cross-sectional area than those observed in glands in situ. This effect was reversed by GHRH. Analysis of the shape of somatotrophs in both groups of grafts disclosed that they were less circular in cross-section than those in glands in situ. The results suggest that GHRH may not play a role in maintaining the percentage of somatotrophs among anterior pituitary cells, but that it does play a role in maintaining their size.", "PMC2878638": "Recently, elevated titers of antibody to HTLV I have been demonstrated in patients with tropical spastic paraparesis and multiple sclerosis.

Using tritiated thymidine labelling of peripheral lymphocytes and of cultured fibroblasts, it was determined that 3 affected patients and 3 normal controls all had similar percent labeled mitoses (PLM) curves, so the increased induced aberration yields seen in the FA cells do not appear to be simply a consequences of a longer than normal G2 phase of the cell cycle.", "PMC3184188": "The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the most abundant glycated hemoglobin in human blood, HbA1c, have been studied in detail. They display significant differences as compared to normal hemoglobin, HbA0, in that (1) the shape of the oxygen binding curve of HbA1c in the Hill plot is markedly asymmetrical, with a lower asymptote extending up to approximately 40% oxygen saturation, and the oxygen affinity of the T state being tenfold higher than in HbA0; (2) oxygen pulse experiments on HbA1c show a slower rate of ligand dissociation (k = 25 s-1) even at low levels of oxygen saturation, where the T state is largely predominant; (3) kinetics of CO combination to deoxy HbA1c followed by means of stopped-flow experiments reveal the presence of a quickly reacting component, whose fraction increases upon dilution of hemoglobin. These results show that in contrast to what has been stated by other authors, HbA1c displays functional properties markedly different from HbA0.

In males, the most important sites were lung, stomach, colon/rectum, mouth/pharynx, prostate and oesophagus, and in females breast, cervix, colon/rectum, stomach, corpus uteri and lung. When the two sexes are combined, stomach cancer emerges as the most common cancer in 1980 (669,400 new cases per year), but this estimate is only slightly greater than that of lung cancer (660,500 new cases), and comparisons with earlier estimates for 1975 suggest that, with declining incidence rates for stomach cancer and the continuing rise for lung cancer, the latter would become the most common cancer in the world by the end of 1981.

Exposures were for 6 h per day, 5 days per week for ca. 4 weeks. There were four groups of rats for each study (10 per sex per group). Aerosol concentrations were ca. 0, 50, 210 and 1000 mg m-3 for each material; the mass median aerodynamic diameter was ca. 1 microns. Following the last exposure, all animals were sacrificed and necropsied. Samples were taken for serum chemistry, hematology, sperm morphology, weights of seven organs and histopathology on at least nine organs. Body weights and clinical signs were not affected by exposures. The only treatment-related changes were in the lung and associated lymph nodes. Both the wet weight of the lung and the dry/wet weight ratio increased in a concentration-related manner. Associated with the increased weight were accumulations of foamy alveolar macrophages, particularly in alveoli close to alveolar ducts. Mild infiltration by neutrophils was observed with WTO and SRO; thickened alveolar walls were noted with the highest concentration of HBO.

We studied the genomic DNA of five patients with beta-thalassaemia whose mutant alleles were uncharacterized, and found two previously undescribed mutations, along with three known alleles. One new allele is a frameshift at codons 106-107 and the other is an A-C transversion at the cap site (+1) of the beta-globin gene.

This work shows that the amino-terminal 29-kD segment of fibronectin binds thrombospondin, the interaction occurs within minutes, and one 29-kD molecule binds per thrombospondin subunit. The interaction was not inhibited by fibrinogen, type V collagen, or heparin.

The latter two agents are generally believed to produce breaks indirectly by producing hydroxyl radicals, a very potent oxidizing species, which attack the phosphodiester backbone of DNA. As expected from earlier results, breaks induced by radiation and bleomycin rapidly disappear during post-treatment incubation as a consequence of the action of cellular DNA repair enzymes. Thus, strand breaks produced by hydroxyl radicals appear to be readily repaired in human leukocytes. By contrast, breaks caused by extracellular superoxide anion appeared not to be readily repaired, implying that some mechanism other than the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the vicinity of the DNA was involved. Inhibitors such as 3-aminobenzamide, cytosine arabinoside and adenine arabinoside affected the apparent rate of repair of radiation and methylmethane sulfonate-induced breaks but there was no indication that they affected superoxide anion-induced breaks. They partially inhibited repair of hydrogen peroxide-induced breaks. Breaks caused by benzoyl peroxide and anthralin were also apparently not repaired. We conclude that hydroxyl radicals are not likely the ultimate DNA strand-breaking species in cells exposed to extracellular superoxide anion and that the observed slow repair of DNA strand breaks may be significant in the mechanism of action of tumor-promoting agents.", "PMC3805255": "Assessed alternate form reliability and equivalency for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) in a clinical sample. A test-retest, counterbalanced design was utilized with a diagnostically heterogenous group of 85 VA Medical Center patients. The mean test-retest interval was 140 min. Alternate form reliability coefficients were highly significant, all p less than .001, and ranged from .60 to .77. The forms yielded comparable means with differences of less than 1 point on each of the five learning trails and the postinterference (VI) and recognition trials. Total words recalled on trials I through V differed by less than 3 points across forms. From a statistical point of view, when the alternate form was administered second it was slightly more difficult than the original. In the reverse order, the two measures were comparable. Overall, differences between forms lacked clinical significance and the tests were judged to be equivalent measures.", "PMC3048872": "An annotated bibliography of 123 references and review papers on graphical description and statistical analysis of vaginal bleeding patterns is presented.", "PMC3435561": "The fabrication and operation of a microelectronic conductimetric biosensor is described.

Sufficiently enriched IgG-subclasses were obtained despite incomplete separation. TSH displacing activity (TDA) was not homogeneously distributed in the subclasses, however IgG1 was most predominant in TDA followed by IgG3, IgG2 being essentially inactive. In two subjects TDA in whole IgG gave positive results in subclasses after fractionation, thus providing evidence, that it would be theoretically possible to move sensitivity of the method close to 100% after subfractionation. TDA was not enriched together with thyroid cell antibodies. We conclude from these results that TDA-IgG is characterized by restricted heterogeneity notwithstanding the incomplete separation of the IgG-subclasses.", "PMC2635727": "In order to establish the incidence of neonatal infection following prolonged (greater than 24 hours) rupture of the fetal membranes (PROM) and assess outcome of two year retrospective study was undertaken. The names of all babies born following PROM were obtained from the computerised obstetric record and the bacteriological results and outcome reviewed. Of 208 babies born following PROM only three had blood cultures containing pathogens--all of whom were of less than 1500 g birthweight and all of whom died. This represents a fivefold increased frequency of infection for premature babies but no increased risk for full term babies. The overall incidence of infection was much lower than in previous series and this may be due to performing amniocentesis as soon as possible following rupture and inducing labour where there was evidence of incipient chorioamnionitis. Meningitis was not associated with prolonged rupture of the membranes. The mortality for these babies was higher than those of babies without PROM in the 28-31 week gestation group. This was strongly associated with early onset of membrane rupture and none of the babies born following membrane rupture prior to 20 weeks gestation survived. Non-infective pulmonary disease was the main cause of increased mortality.", "PMC3296253": "Prompt recognition, early localization, and adequate drainage have contributed to the decreased morbidity and mortality rates associated with intra-abdominal abscess in the last decade. The physical examination, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and radionuclide scans provide information that leads to early detection and localization of abscess in almost all patients.

We observed the following: clonogenic breast tumor cells were more sensitive to 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (a metabolite of cyclophosphamide with in vitro activity) than to 5-fluorouracil and to doxorubicin (the other two agents used in the frontline treatment of breast carcinoma). The sensitivity of these clonogenic breast tumor cells for mitoxantrone, bisantrene, 4'-epi-doxorubicin, and VP-16 was similar to that for doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil, but it was less for cis-platinum. In vivo exposure to a combination of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) did not change the sensitivity of cells towards 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin, but lessened the sensitivity of some cells towards 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. Furthermore, in vivo exposure to doxorubicin did not influence the sensitivity of cells towards the anthraquinone derivatives, 4'-epi-doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and bisantrene. A comparison of the in vitro and in vivo chemosensitivity revealed that the assayed cell populations were biologically relevant: the concordance of sensitivity on 41 tumors was 68%, or 95%, if the in vitro sensitivity score was adjusted to the tumor bulk. We conclude that our system provides a valid tool to determine the inherent chemosensitivity pattern of the individual tumor types, and to compare the tumor cytotoxic potential of drugs.", "PMC2559992": "Consultation patterns in a practice with no appointment system, situated in a socially deprived area, were examined to confirm or refute one doctor's perception that the consultation rate was much higher than average. Seventy five per cent of a sample of patients (n = 394) had consulted in the previous year. The mean annual consultation rate was 3.8 (range 0 to 29) but the median was 3.0 and the mode 0. Among 222 patients consulting over one month the mean annual consultation rate was 10.0 (range 0 to 47) with a median of 9.0 and a mode of 6. The duration of consultation (n = 506) varied from one to 25 minutes (with mean, median and modal values of 5.3, 4.0 and 4 minutes respectively) and 53% of patients received between one and four minutes. The overall consultation rate was not high, particularly in view of the socioeconomic deprivation of the practice population, and the doctor's perception of excessive consultation was explained by the high consultation rate among attenders. The consultation pattern, particularly of males, was not conducive to a preventive approach. The mean was a poor descriptor of the average consultation rate or duration.", "PMC2559990": "Doubts were expressed about the effectiveness of measles vaccination during a measles outbreak in a Bristol primary school. Investigation of this outbreak showed that the vaccine uptake rate was 89%, vaccine effectiveness was 84% and that 57% of children developing measles had a history of previous measles vaccination. This apparent paradox arises because, for any vaccine that is not 100% effective, as the vaccine uptake rate rises so the percentage of cases previously vaccinated also rises. An understanding of this relationship may avoid unjustified loss of confidence in vaccine effectiveness as vaccine uptake increases.", "PMC2173109": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) interstitial pneumonia is a frequent and often fatal complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Because therapy for CMV pneumonia was, until recently, largely ineffective, prophylactic methods were explored.

The results of this study are put into the perspective of previously published data.", "PMC3306252": "Pelvic adhesions are a major contributing factor to infertility in women with tubal peritoneal disease. Surgical treatment of such adhesions often does not resolve their presence. Such postoperative adhesion formation occurs despite the use of microsurgical techniques in a wide variety of surgical adjuvants. The process of adhesion formation represents a variation of the normal healing process of the peritoneum. However, rather than normal mesothelial healing, the fibrinous mass resulting from the peritoneal defect is infiltrated by fibroblasts with subsequent adhesion formation. A description of the pathophysiology of this process is described. The current understanding of the pathologic/pathophysiologic interaction of the surgical adjuvants with this process is described.", "PMC5379107": "Isolation of polyribosomes from wheat embryos and corn root tips in the presence of diethyl pyrocarbonate showed this reagent to have a protective effect on polyribosome structure. In addition, the use of diethyl pyrocarbonate allowed initial homogenization to be performed under less stringent conditions than those normally employed for polyribosome isolation. The use of the reagent is however limited, in that it is deleterious to in vitro ribosomal amino acid incorporation.", "PMC2955075": "We investigated the anti-obesity effects of the adrenal androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), on genetically predisposed obese lethal yellow mice (Ay/Aw). Secondly, we tested the hypothesis that DHEA promotes its anti-obesity effects by decreasing the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). We subjected four genotype-sex combinations of yellow and agouti (control) mice to four dietary treatments and determined weight changes, food consumption, and G6PDH activity. Although G6PDH activities of yellow mice were considerably decreased in the 0.4% DHEA treatment group, they were elevated in the 0.0 and 0.1% DHEA treatment groups. In contrast, G6PDH activities of DHEA-treated control agouti mice remained relatively constant. These studies confirm that DHEA prevents the Ay gene from promoting excess fat deposition via some mechanism(s) other than reduced dietary intake. However, the overall absence of agreement between weight change (gain or loss) and G6PDH activity suggests that the anti-obesity activity of DHEA is not mediated via G6PDH. Since yellow obese (Ay/Aw) mice were found to be more susceptible to DHEA's effects than their agouti (Aw/Aw) littermates, Ay appears to induce an altered metabolism in Ay/Aw mice which is more susceptible to the effects of DHEA than the normal metabolism of Aw/Aw mice.", "PMC3290515": "To determine the relative incidence of recurrent carotid stenosis (RCS) and the effect of methodology on data analysis and interpretation, late results were obtained for 232 patients (270 procedures) from 1 to 51 months (mean 22 months) after carotid endarterectomy (group A). Patency of the carotid artery was confirmed by postoperative intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for most of the series, and a subset (subgroup A1) of 113 patients (129 procedures) also received DSA studies at later intervals of 4 to 49 months (mean 26 months). There were 23 late deaths and five late strokes. Only two of the strokes were ipsilateral to previous endarterectomy, and both of these patients had normal follow-up DSA studies. Late DSA imaging revealed either no RCS or only trivial defects (20% diameter or less) in 111 arteries, moderate (36% to 60%) RCS in nine, severe (70% to 90%) RCS requiring secondary procedures in eight, and internal carotid occlusion in one. Depending on the definition of RCS (secondary operation vs greater than or equal to 30% angiographic lesions), the cohort selected for analysis (group A vs subgroup A1), and the approach to calculations (crude vs cumulative), the incidence of recurrent stenosis after carotid reconstruction in this single study could be expressed within the extraordinary wide range of 3% to 32%. Although carotid endarterectomy was associated with uniformly low risk for late stroke, these results confirm that the reported recurrence rate may be substantially influenced by the method in which data are grouped and manipulated. Consistently presented data are essential to any comparisons concerning the surgical therapy for extracranial disease.", "PMC4055262": "Manganese chloride (MnCl2), with or without the addition of trace amounts of 54Mn2+, was administered as a 7-min i.v. infusion in rats. Tissue accumulation of 54Mn2+ was determined 0-15 min after the infusion, and cardiac output, regional blood flows and vascular resistances were measured 5 and 60 min after the infusion by the microsphere technique. The plasma half-life of 54Mn2+ was found to be 4.7 min. Mn2+ accumulated in several organs, the highest relative concentrations being seen in the liver, duodenum, jejunum, kidney and heart, and intermediate concentrations in the ileum, colon, stomach and spleen. There was no uptake in the lung, skeletal muscle or brain. During the infusion of 180 mumol/kg b.w. of Mn2+, the arterial blood pressure fell from a mean of 123 +/- 5 mm Hg to a minimum of 85 +/- 7 mm Hg, and thereafter returned to normal. Five minutes after termination of the infusion, there was a decrease in cardiac output and minute work but not in total peripheral resistance, a finding interpreted as a negative inotropic effect of Mn2+. At this time blood flow was decreased in the stomach, ileum, colon, spleen and skin, and increased in duodenum, jejunum and liver. The blood flows were normalized 60 min after termination of the infusion in all organs except the liver and heart. The effects are probably due to the calcium-antagonistic properties of Mn2+ and the tissue accumulation is most probably a result of intracellular accumulation through calcium channels. The relation between tissue accumulation and tissue selectivity of blood-flow alterations is unexplained.", "PMC2901362": "The effects of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists were examined on seizure thresholds determined by intravenous infusions of convulsants in rodents. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor antagonists were proconvulsant; dose dependently reducing the threshold for pentylenetetrazol- or bicuculline-induced tonic seizures. Strychnine-induced tonic seizures were unaffected. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine, BHT-933 and UK 14,304 did not modify pentylenetetazol-induced seizures at low or moderate doses but at high doses clonidine and BHT-933 were proconvulsant. The facilitatory effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists on pentylenetetrazol-induced tonic seizures was blocked by clonidine or UK 14,304. The proconvulsant action of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists was contrasted with that of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, a benzodiazepine receptor contragonist, which markedly reduced the threshold for seizure initiation rather than the tonic seizure threshold. The selective facilitatory action of alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade on tonic seizures suggests that a noradrenergic mechanism is involved in the control of seizure propagation rather than seizure initiation.", "PMC3904523": "The distribution of glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide was studied immunocytochemically in rat pancreas at both light and electron microscopic levels. My earlier observation that these two peptides are distributed in three cell types--cells containing glucagon, cells containing pancreatic polypeptide, and cells containing both--was confirmed at the electron microscopic level. In the glucagon-pancreatic polypeptide cells, the immunoreactivities of the two peptides were present in the same secretion granules. In addition, these glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide-containing granules were morphologically distinct from glucagon granules but similar to pancreatic polypeptide granules and somatostatin granules.", "PMC3840052": "A 175 kdalton (kDa) polypeptide is bound covalently to the chromosomal DNA fragments from mouse cells exposed to the intercalating agent 4'-[(9-acridinyl)-amino]methansulphon-m-anisidide.

Since the relative molecular mass of topoisomerase II polypeptide chains is also about 175 kDa and topoisomerase II inhibitors prevent intercalator-induced DNA fragmentation, we propose that the polypeptide bound covalently to the 5'-terminus of the DNA fragments is a polypeptide derived from frequently integrated topoisomerase II operating to normalize torsional stress resulting from intercalation.", "PMC2806384": "Based on a vasoconstrictor role for serotonin (5-HT) in various types of cardiopulmonary conditions the effect of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, on 5-HT-induced responses in the intact, isolated rat lung was investigated. 5-HT produced biphasic responses consisting of weak vasodilator and predominant, dose-dependent constrictor components.

Twelve patients who died of causes other than intracranial disease served as controls. Tonsillar herniation occurred in all who died of acute CVDs. More advanced GLA was seen in the central folia adjacent to the central white medullary body of the cerebellum as compared with the peripheral folia. Widespread GLA involving the most of the peripheral folia was found solely in patients in whom brain death had been present over 18 h. Of the 12 control patients, 4 showed GLA only in the central folia. Although GLA of the central folia might develop during immersion fixation of the brain, the alteration of the peripheral folia is assumed to develop in the period of brain death. Widespread GLA extending to the peripheral folia could be a pathological finding characteristic of brain death, where intracranial blood flow could be absent or significantly reduced. Brain death for little less than 1 day would be necessary for GLA to develop.", "PMC3258162": "The interaction of complement component C1q with fibrinogen and fibrin was studied by using a solid-phase direct binding assay. Scatchard analysis of radioiodinated fibrinogen binding to C1q indicated at least two high-affinity binding constants (Kd) calculated as 8.5 and 120 nM. In contrast, binding of radioiodinated fibrin to C1q showed only a single class of binding sites with a calculated Kd of 600 nM. Fibrinogen-C1q binding was shown to decrease as a function of increasing salt concentrations, indicating either the presence of charged amino acids in the binding sites or an ionic strength induced conformational dependency of the binding. In direct binding studies using isolated fragments of C1q, both the collagen-like domain of C1q and the globular domains of C1q were shown to bind fibrinogen, indicating at least one binding site for fibrinogen is located in each of the major domains of C1q. Addition of the thrombin-generated peptides of fibrinogen, fibrinopeptides A and B, enhanced C1q-fibrinogen binding, again indicating a complex binding interaction. These results indicate that C1q and fibrinogen are capable of high-affinity interactions that may serve to sequester these complexes in areas of tumors, immune complex deposition, or wounds.", "PMC3964940": "Differences in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signal-to-noise (S/N) performance between saddle-shaped and solenoidal coils have been postulated.

Similar plasma levels and excretion values were observed by using radioimmunoassay and HPLC-liquid scintillation techniques. For the latter technique Sandostatin was radiolabeled with either 14C or 3H. The plasma pharmacokinetics of Sandostatin were as follows: Vdss = 0.4 liter/kg, C/t = 4.2 ml/min, and t1/2 2.0 hr; this half-life was by far longer than that of somatostatin. The in vitro protein binding amounted to 59% in rat plasma; no Sandostatin was taken up by blood cells. The tissue concentrations of Sandostatin were similar when determined either by radioimmunoassay or by quantitative whole-body autoradiography; this suggests that the distribution of 3H or 14C radioactivity observed 0.5 hr after iv administration mostly represented unchanged Sandostatin. Kidney and liver were the only tissues in which Sandostatin levels were higher than in blood; high radioactivity levels were observed in the blood vessel walls, whereas levels in brain were insignificant. Unchanged drug accounted for most of the radioactivity found in plasma, urine, and bile, whereas only traces of unchanged drug were detected in feces. These results demonstrated the metabolic stability of Sandostatin in the tissues, primarily in the liver, and suggested an extensive degradation in the intestinal tract. The degradation products consisted of smaller peptides and free amino acids. About 50% and 20% of the applied dose were excreted as unchanged Sandostatin in bile and urine, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2767187": "The responses of 82 simple cells and 41 complex cells in area 17 of anesthetized and paralysed cats were examined with light bars of different length. For 84% of the simple cells and 66% of the complex cells the preferred axis of orientation of a stationary flashing long bar (orientational selectivity) and the preferred axis of movement of a small spot were parallel. As a consequence, the axis of maximal response to a moving light spot was mostly orthogonal to the optimal axis of a moving bar. Thus, a single cell responds to two perpendicular axes of preferred movement one for a long bar and one for a light spot, respectively. For both axes independent direction preferences could be distinguished. Additional preferred axes of movement between the two orthogonal extremes could be found with moving bars of intermediate lengths. This can be explained by the fact that cells with a pronounced response to a moving spot showed a strong tendency for intermediate bar length to elicit responses consisting of a superposition of both components. Therefore, decreasing bar length resulted in a gradual rotation of the preferred direction of movement from orthogonal to parallel with respect to the orientational axis, rather than to a mere widening of the tuning curve. Accordingly, the change in orientation selectivity with decreasing bar length is a regular transition from the orientation dependent response to a response type that depends only on the movement axis of the spot. Thus, in a simple model, the resulting response characteristic can be interpreted as an average of both components weighted according to the length of the stimulus.", "PMC2795093": "Radiation exposure to various systems can result in the development of severe toxicity, known as the acute radiation syndrome, with hematopoietic tissues being acutely susceptible to radiation-induced injury. Usually it is the degree of hematopoietic toxicity that determines the feasibility of further tumor control doses of therapy. Therefore the development of agents capable of protecting hematopoietic tissues could have important clinical applications. The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been demonstrated to be an effective agent capable of protecting hematopoietic tissues in vivo from the toxicity associated with radiation exposure. We report here the results of studies designed to further investigate the capability of various cytokines (IL-1 and interleukins-2 and -3) to protect bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors [granulocyte-macrophage and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM and CFU-Meg)] from radiation exposure in vitro. Only IL-1 was effective in protecting CFU-GM and CFU-Meg from radiation-induced toxicity in the range of 1-10 U/ml; however, no protection was observed when the radiation dose was greater than 300 rad. The ability of IL-1 to block radiation-induced toxicity was negated in the presence of an antibody to IL-1. These studies provide further information on the effectiveness of IL-1 in protecting in vitro hematopoietic tissues from toxicity associated with radiation exposure.", "PMC3546561": "Recent treatment strategies have been directed toward blockade of estrogen action or inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis as a means of inducing regression of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The major source of estrogen in postmenopausal women is the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrone through the enzyme aromatase. It is known that aromatase activity increases proportionately with degree of obesity in women. To test the importance of this modulatory factor, we correlated body weight with estrogen excretion in our population of patients with breast cancer and found significant relationships. In situ production of estradiol from plasma precursors within breast cancer tissue may provide another source of estrogen. Major enzymes mediating estrogen biosynthesis were found to be present in tumor biopsy specimens. Aromatase activity was found to be present in 48/61 human tumors, sulfatase in 35/35, and 17 beta -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in 41/41. One inhibitor of aromatase, aminoglutethimide, has been extensively studied in patients with breast cancer. The additional effects of this drug on cholesterol side-chain cleavage and on 11-hydroxylase activity require coadministration of replacement glucocorticoid in treatment regimens. In pilot trials, 37% of patients experienced objective tumor regression with a combination of 1000 mg aminoglutethimide and 40 mg hydrocortisone daily. In randomized clinical trials with this regimen, aromatase inhibition with aminoglutethimide produced tumor regression with similar frequency as did surgical hypophysectomy, surgical adrenalectomy, or tamoxifen administration. The side effects of aminoglutethimide, including lethargy, skin rash, and ataxia complicate its use even though these problems are generally transient. Regimens of low-dose aminoglutethimide are being developed to reduce these side effects. Low-dose aminoglutethimide appears to block aromatase effectively and to have limited side effects, and is undergoing extensive clinical trial. A more specific aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione, is now also being tested clinically, whereas MDL 18962, another new selective inhibitor, is undergoing study in animals.", "PMC3422537": "Basophilia has been reported to indicate an accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), heralding a poor prognosis. We have studied 47 patients with chronic-phase CML by basophil growth and differentiation assays in vitro, demonstrating an association between basophil growth index (BGI) and clinical time to blast crisis as well as overall survival. In addition to confirming an association between positive BGI and phase of CML in a larger group of patients, a positive BGI predicted death or blast crisis within 2 years' study of chronic phase CML (p less than 0.01), with a sensitivity of 78%, specificity, 81%; the positive predictive value of a positive test, 64%; and a negative predictive value of a negative test, 89%. The survival experience of the 22 evaluable patients with chronic-phase CML and a positive BGI was significantly worse than the survival of the 19 patients with a negative BGI (p less than 0.0001). At 1, 2, and 3 years the proportion of surviving patients with a positive BGI was 0.64, 0.32, and 0.23, respectively, compared with 1.00, 0.90, and 0.79 for those with a negative BGI. The median survival of chronic phase CML patients with a positive test at diagnosis (n = 14) was 27 months versus 54 months for those with a negative diagnosis (n = 14) (p less than 0.05). These findings emphasize the prognostic utility of basophil growth assays in CML and suggest a molecular relationship between leukemic transformation and basophil lineage expression.", "PMC3539135": "The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial growth inhibitory property of amniotic fluid (AF) from patients in the early third trimester and to examine its relationship to preterm labor and delivery. A total of 38 AF samples from patients between 27 and 35 weeks gestation with intact membranes were studied. Antibacterial activity was tested against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. Fifteen fluids were from patients in preterm labor who delivered near term after successful inhibition of labor. Five of these fluids (33%) were inhibitory to E. coli, five (33%) to S. aureus, and 11 (73%) to B. fragilis. Nine fluids were from patients who failed inhibition of labor and delivered preterm; none of these were inhibitory to E. coli, two (22%) to S. aureus, and only one (11%) to B. fragilis (P less than 0.005). Two of the nine fluids from patients who failed inhibition of labor also yielded fusobacteria. The remaining 14 fluids were obtained from patients without preterm labor and exhibited antibacterial activity similar to that from patients with successful labor inhibition.

The CF derived glycopeptides had two different features when compared to those from Controls (1) an increased number of fucosyl residues linked alpha 1----6 to the N-acetylglucosamine attached to asparagine and (2) fucosyl residues linked alpha 1----3 to a branch N-acetylglucosamine. The glycopeptides from both sources were of the di and triantennary type containing sialic acid linked alpha 2----3 and alpha 2----6 to galactose in an approximate molar ratio of 3:2 and 2:1, from CF and Control, respectively. Glycopeptides derived from a glycoprotein, fibronectin, secreted from CF fibroblasts were also examined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and showed no evidence of fucosyl residues linked alpha 1----3 to branch N-acetylglucosamine and a lesser percentage of core fucose than found in the peripheral membrane glycopeptides.

K and N were twofold and fourfold higher, respectively, after growth in LBC compared with that in YNB. A comparison of adhesion in different assay solutions gave similar results, with the solution given to dehydrated patients (5% glucose in 0.45% NaCl [D5.45]) allowing for the highest K and the largest N. Scatchard curves for both LBC- and YNB-grown cells had negative slopes, which is supportive evidence for the view that negative cooperativity is involved in the binding process. Additional experiments to examine the role of cell surface hydrophobicity in adhesion to plastic were conducted with the white and opaque phenotypes of C. albicans. There was no significant difference in the adhesion of these phenotypes to plastic, although the opaque phenotype was significantly more hydrophobic. Adhesion, but not cell surface hydrophobicity, of both phenotypes was significantly greater in D5.45. Moreover, relatively hydrophilic mycelial forms of C. albicans were found to attach only when D5.45 was used as the assay medium and, in contrast to yeast-phase cells, were insensitive to reduced adhesion by nonionic detergents. These results suggest that the adhesion of C. albicans to plastic is regulated by environmental circumstances and the phenotypic state of the organism.", "PMC3661926": "A maximum pump output pressure under 15 psi which is adapted to the necessary back pressures and flow pressures can provide a reduction of problems related to pressure build-up. Thus, the time to alarm in case of occlusion and the bolus dosage after removal of the obstruction can be minimized. This is important in the use of critical drugs with short half-lives, such as catecholamines and vasoactive substances. On the basis of aspects described above, it appears necessary to reconsider technical requirements. Finally, the definition of accuracy and technical solutions for an improved alarm function of electronic infusion systems are discussed.", "PMC3498208": "We studied the early events in athymic immunoincompetent rats after implantation with cultured thymic fragments (CTF) under the kidney capsule, with special emphasis on the settlement of lymphocytes and non-lymphoid RT1 class II elements. At 2 weeks after grafting, tissue under the kidney capsule comprises strands of keratin-positive epithelial cells from the graft, without immigrant cells. At 3 weeks, the CTF graft is populated with lymphocytes and with non-lymphoid RT1 class II-positive cells expressing the recipient haplotype (allogeneic combinations). Part of these cells bear determinants recognized by an anti-rat dendritic cell antibody. At 4 weeks the graft exhibits a completely restored thymic architecture. At the periphery, the first indications of T-cell competence generated after CTF implantation are observed 6 weeks after implantation. At 18 weeks, the peripheral thymus-dependent immune system is almost completely developed. This includes in vitro alloreactivity, even to the donor RT1 haplotype of the graft. But skin grafts of the allogeneic CTF donor haplotype are not rejected. Thus, a state of in vivo tolerance is induced under the influence of grafted epithelium, which is not due to a specific deletion of alloreactive cells. We conclude that CTF regain their original thymic architecture between 2 and 4 weeks after implantation in (allogeneic) athymic nude recipients, and that only after this restoration does peripheral thymus-dependent immune competence start to develop.", "PMC3469657": "Cell-free fusion between endocytic vesicles has been obtained in a sensitive assay based on the avidin-biotin binding reaction. Chinese hamster ovary cells are allowed to endocytose either avidin-linked beta-galactosidase or biotinylated IgG. Postnuclear supernatant extracts prepared from these cells are incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. Fusion between vesicles from the two extracts permits the avidin-biotin association to occur, so that the amount of avidin-enzyme-biotinylated IgG complex produced is proportional to the amount of fusion between vesicles. The amount of complex formed is measured, after detergent lysis of the vesicles, by an ELISA technique, using a fluorogenic substrate for beta-galactosidase. The fusion process requires ATP hydrolysis and specific cytosolic proteins. The vesicles that fuse appear to be endocytic vesicles populated by the endocytosed proteins within 5 min of their internalization at 37 degrees C. Ionophores and weak bases do not inhibit fusion, suggesting that a pH gradient across the vesicle membrane is not crucial for the fusion process.", "PMC3673990": "Hemoperitoneum is usually due to rupture, laceration, or perforation of a blood vessel or organ.

The centromere regions of the three chromosomes were contained on three SalI fragments (120 kilobases [kb], chromosome III; 90 kb, chromosome II; and 50 kb, chromosome I). Each fragment contained several repetitive DNA sequences, including repeat K (6.4 kb), repeat L (6.0 kb), and repeat B, that occurred only in the three centromere regions. On chromosome II, these repeats were organized into a 35-kb inverted repeat that included one copy of K and L in each arm of the repeat. Site-directed integration of a plasmid containing the yeast LEU2 gene into K repeats at each of the centromeres or integration of an intact K repeat into a chromosome arm had no effect on mitotic or meiotic centromere function. The centromeric repeat sequences were not transcribed and possessed many of the properties of constitutive heterochromatin.

Mean body weight increased by 3.0 +/- 0.3 kg, without any change in average size of isolated abdominal adipocytes. Overfeeding resulted in a 58% increase (P less than 0.01) in mean fasting plasma insulin concentration, whereas fasting plasma glucose concentration remained constant. Basal and maximum (8 nmol/L) insulin-stimulated glucose transport rates by isolated adipocytes increased by 83% (P less than 0.02) and 110% (P less than 0.01), respectively, after overfeeding, associated with an increase of 118% (P less than 0.01) in the incremental response to maximal insulin stimulation. However, no differences in either the sensitivity (ED50 of insulin for the stimulation of glucose transport) or the responsiveness (percent stimulation by insulin) of glucose transport were seen in isolated adipocytes as a result of overfeeding. Maximum insulin-stimulated total glucose utilization rates by isolated adipocytes incubated at 5.5 mmol/L glucose were 63% greater after overfeeding, due to increases in lactate formation, triglyceride synthesis, and CO2 production. Mono125I-(Tyr A14)-insulin binding per cell and per cell surface area was similar before and after overfeeding. The lipolytic rate of isolated adipocytes, in the absence and presence of 25 nmol/L and 2 mumol/L isoproterenol, was decreased by 75% (P less than 0.02), 45% (P less than 0.05), and 27% (P less than 0.05), respectively, after overfeeding.

However, the rationales these women had for undergoing sterilization were not always clear-cut; often a mixture of medical and contraceptive reasons were given. In this study, Cycle III data from the National Survey of Family Growth, 1982, were used to investigate the determinants of different types of sterilization decisions--sterilizing for contraceptive, medical, or \"mixed\" reasons. It is important to recognize this \"mixed\" component of sterilization motivation.

Accordingly, the World Health Organization undertook a prospective study in which several noninvasive methods were employed together in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy. The examinations analyzed encompassed chest roentgenography, electrocardiography, vectorcardiography, mechanocardiography, echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy and ventriculography and pulmonary scintigraphy. From the chest X-ray, the size of the main pulmonary artery, the transpulmonary artery distance and the size of the right descending pulmonary artery were analyzed; correct identification of patients with or without pulmonary hypertension was achieved in only 40%. With respect to the electrocardiogram, the number of false negative and false positive findings renders this method of negligible usefulness. Mechanocardiography proved technically difficult and incurred inconsistencies in interpretation such that this method was only rarely useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. The same held true for the use of echocardiography since it is technically difficult to obtain adequate imaging in patients with overinflated lungs and the pulmonic valve can only be visualized in about 50% of the patients. Right ventricular systolic time intervals would be interest but their measurement can only be accomplished in a small number of patients. Myocardial scintigraphy with thallium-201 may render indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension if the right ventricular wall can be visualized; this is the case in 80% of patients in whom mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 30 mm Hg but only in 56% of those with mean pulmonary artery pressures between 21 and 30 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3426803": "An inhibitor of neutral proteinases was isolated from the cytosol of bovine leukocytes by anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q and gel filtration on a HPLC TSK column.

The latter was shown to be homogeneous in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa, with calibrated HPLC a molecular mass of 36.5 kDa has been determined. Isoelectric focusing followed by Western blot analysis revealed four bands in the pH range of 5.0 to 5.9. The inhibitor was found in bovine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), whereas lymphocytes and monocytes lacked this protein. No immunological cross-reactivity between the described cell-derived PMN-inhibitor (PMN-I) and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor was detectable. The mechanism of inhibition for the serine proteinases chymotrypsin, trypsin, pancreatic elastase and leukocyte elastase was studied. PMN-I could not bind to PMS-chymotrypsin.

Nitroglycerin (GTN), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and sodium nitroprusside (NP) were found to inhibit dose-dependently the intracellular Ca+2 increase induced by the platelet activating factor (PAF). The inhibiting effect of NP was at lower concentrations than those of GTN and ISDN. GTN calcium blocking action did not change significantly regardless of vasopressin, serotonin or PAF used as inducers of the intracellular Ca+2 increase. GTN suppressed the PAF provoked Mn+2 entering into the cells. NP and GTN induced increase of the cGMP content correlated with their calcium blocking activity. They did not augment the level of cAMP. Methylene blue (MB), a guanylate cyclase and glutathione reductase inhibitor, decreased the calcium blocking effect of GTN and its influence on the cGMP content but failed to suppress the inhibitory effect of NP. Ascorbic acid increased the calcium blocking effect of NP but did not influence the inhibitory effect of GTN. An increase in Ca+2 content induced by PAF in platelets from patients with chronic congestive heart failure was significantly higher in the group with dilatation cardiomyopathy. The effect of 10 mg of ISDN sublingually on forearm venous tone was higher in patients with initially elevated venous tone.

This paper draws attention to some other sources of variation which Grayson does not consider but which have been considered by other writers and which might have somewhat different consequences for the estimation of shared environmental effects.

Using the double sucrose gap technique, we investigated the effects of Sr2+ and Ba2+ ions on the Na+ Ca2+ exchange activity in frog atrial fibres where it is the major relaxation mechanism. With either Sr2+ or Ba2+ ions instead of Ca2+ in the extracellular bath, Na-free contractures reversibly developed but with different kinetics. Voltage clamp experiments showed that the tonic tension recorded in the presence of Sr2+ or Ba2+ was markedly increased following the addition of monensin, a Na+ ionophore known to increase the intracellular Na+ activity. In Na-free solutions (Li-substituted), it was possible to induce contractures by substituting Sr2+ or Ba2+ ions for extracellular Ca2+. These contractures could be relaxed by reintroducing Na+ or Ca2+ ions in the extracellular medium. Taken together, these results suggest that Sr2+ and Ba2+ ions can interact with the Na+-Ca2+ exchange mechanism and potentially participate not only in Na+-cation but also in Ca2+-cation exchanges on either side of the sarcolemmal membrane.", "PMC2965234": "We tested the response of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels to the following physiological stimuli: postural changes; head-out water immersion; and physical exercise.

Head-out water immersion produced a prompt and remarkable (sevenfold) increase in p-ANP, with a plateau reached after 1 h and held until the end of the experiment (2 h). Plasma ANP levels were measured in 10 normal subjects performing supine treadmill exercise at 50% of maximum aerobic capacity for 30 min.

Small thymic epithelial cells, TECS, had receptors for EGF with high affinity, Kd = 1.2 X 10(-9) M, and exhibited increased DNA synthesis and increased RNA synthesis upon stimulation with EGF. In addition, incubation of TECS monolayers with EGF resulted in enhanced production of prostaglandin E2. In contrast, large thymic epithelial cells, TECL, did not express receptors for EGF and demonstrated no biological response to the hormone. These results suggest the possibility that intrathymic regulation of lymphoid cells may occur via the action of \"nonimmunologic\" mediators on thymic epithelial cells.

The cellular content of ME-IRM following the actual release induced by these secretagogues remained constant suggesting the replenishment of the cellular peptides. The repletion of the peptides may occur through an enhancement of the processing rate of the proenkephalin precursor. Furthermore, the increase in secretion as well as the repletion of the cellular ME-IRM were calcium-dependent and were inhibited by the nicotinic receptor antagonist, hexamethonium, but not by atropine. These results indicate that secretion and repletion of the peptides are tightly coupled and activated by nicotinic receptor stimulation.", "PMC2894018": "The influence of some antagonists of histamine receptors on morphine-, fentanyl-, and pentazocine-induced analgesia was studied in rats and mice.

Analgesic effects of pentazocine were not changed by benzhydramine and mepyramine. H2-receptor antagonist-cimetidine enhanced also analgesia induced by morphine and fentanyl in rats, but it either increased (after icv injection of 50 micrograms) or decreased (after icv injection of 100 micrograms) the action of pentazocine. Thus, H1 and H2 antagonists potentiate the antinociceptive effects of morphine and fentanyl but the action of pentazocine is not changed by H1 antagonists and is affected in an inconsistent manner by a H2 antagonist cimetidine.

The concentration of BSO required to reduce the colony forming ability to 50% (Cc) for the chronic cytotoxicity on V79 cells was 0.03 mmol/L under aerobic condition, while the Cc for the acute cytotoxicity on V79 cells under hypoxic and aerobic conditions was 0.4 and 0.5 mmol/L. The growth inhibition rate of human tumor cells K562 and SGC-7901 by BSO was 6.89-26.06% and 12.01-55.69%, respectively. Enhanced cytotoxicity activity was observed when BSO was used in combination with cis-dichlorodiamino Pt(II) or 5-fluorouracil.", "PMC2410131": "The calcium selective ionophore, ETH 1001, and the divalent cation ionophore, A23187, promoted Ca2+ flux across RBC membranes under various experimental conditions. ETH 1001 did not promote the passive movement of Mg2+ whereas A23187 did. The results confirm the potential application of ETH 1001 as a Ca2+ selective ionophore for biological membranes.", "PMC3663118": "The basic glutathione S-transferases in human liver are composed of at least two immunochemically distinct polypeptides, designated B1 and B2. These subunits exist as homodimers, but can hybridize to form the B1B2 heterodimer [Stockman, Beckett & Hayes (1985) Biochem. J. 227, 457-465]. Although these basic glutathione S-transferases possess similar catalytic properties, the B2 subunit exhibits significantly greater selenium-independent glutathione peroxidase activity than subunit B1. The use of the ligands haematin, tributyltin acetate and Bromosulphophthalein as inhibitors of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene-GSH-conjugating activity clearly discriminate between the B1 and B2 subunits and should help facilitate their identification. Peptide mapping experiments showed that B1 and B2 are structurally distinct, but related, subunits; subunit B1 yielded 43 tryptic peptides, seven of which were unique, whereas subunit B2 yielded 40 tryptic peptides, four of which were unique.", "PMC2475644": "Twenty-four patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were investigated for possible changes in certain indole amine constituents in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Albumin in serum was determined and used as a rough nutritional marker. Six of the 24 patients had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS, four had other clinical symptoms of HIV infection, and 14 had no apparent symptoms. The HIV-seropositive patients had significantly decreased tryptophan values; their blood concentrations were 28% lower and their CSF concentrations 30% lower than corresponding values in 14 healthy controls. The blood concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were 50% lower, and the platelet content of 5-HT was 36% lower in HIV-infected individuals than in the control group. The most pronounced changes were invariably seen in the six cases with AIDS and in patients with a low number of CD4+ cells. No significant difference between controls and HIV-seropositive patients was detected in the mean CSF concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), although these levels were markedly reduced in four of the HIV patients.

The prevalence of radiographic evidence of International Labour Office (ILO) category 1 or higher small opacities was 4.5% in 516 men who had never been employed in a dusty job other than in surface coal mining. Among these 516 workers, all 4 cases of ILO radiographic category 2 or 3 rounded opacities and 1 case of large opacities had been employed as a highwall drill operator or helper. The prevalence of category 1 or higher opacities increased with tenure as a highwall drill operator or helper (2.7% for 0 y, 6.5% for 1-9 yr, 25.0% for 10-19 y, and 55.6% for greater than or equal to 20 y drilling). Radiographic evidence of small rounded opacities, dyspnea, and decreases in FEV1.0, FVC, and peak flow were significantly related to tenure at drilling operations after adjusting for age, height, cigarette smoking status, and exposures in dusty jobs other than in surface coal mining. However, tenure in coal cleansing plants and other surface coal mine jobs were not related to significant health effects. The apparent excess prevalence of radiographic small rounded opacities in anthracite surface coal mine drillers suggests that quartz exposures have been increased. Average respirable quartz concentrations at surface coal mine drilling operations should be evaluated to determine whether exposures are within existing standards, and dust exposures should be controlled.", "PMC2553840": "Opioid-binding sites were quantified in the ewe hypothalamus using [3H]diprenorphine ([3H]DIP) as the radioligand. [3H]DIP binding to hypothalamic membrane preparations was stereospecific, saturable with respect to [3H]DIP concentration, and linear with hypothalamic membrane protein content. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of binding sites. There were no significant differences in binding site concentration or binding affinity in hypothalami from intact ewes during the breeding and non-breeding seasons, or from long-term ovariectomized ewes with and without oestradiol treatment during the breeding season. Thus, whilst ovarian steroid hormones are known to modify LH responses to opioids and their antagonists in the ewe in vivo, they do not appear to do this by modulating the numbers of hypothalamic opioid-binding sites.", "PMC2790310": "McCormick's Toy Discrimination test allows a skilled audiologist to obtain word discrimination thresholds in quiet from children with mental ages of 2 years and above.

Alpha interferon has been a prototype of other biological agents that are now in clinical development. These agents operate through fundamentally different mechanisms of action than conventional chemotherapy and have produced a unique profile of side effects as well as response patterns. Time to response is generally longer than with chemotherapy, and dose-response and schedule-dependency questions continue to be explored for most tumor types. Although response rates have been low against most solid tumors when alpha interferon is used as a single agent, it has demonstrated a surprisingly wide range of efficacy in hematologic malignancies. These include tumors of presumed B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid lineages. In some diseases, e.g., hairy cell leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, alpha interferon is broadly effective; it appears to considerably reduce or occasionally eliminate the malignant clone while normalizing the peripheral blood counts in most patients. In other diseases, alpha interferon appears destined to play a major role as part of combination therapy or in maintenance or consolidation therapy. In other disease settings, alpha interferon's role continues to be explored as part of combination therapy, adjuvant therapy, or as local-regional therapy. The full potential of alpha interferon as an antineoplastic agent will not be determined for many years.

These data support the hypothesis that VP acts synergistically with CRF to cause the secretion of ACTH in vivo but the origin of the CRF and VP, and the physiology of their release, have not been precisely defined. Parvocellular cell bodies in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) which project to the external zone of the median eminence can be stained for both CRF and VP after adrenalectomy, and there is light microscopic immunocytochemical evidence that neurophysin (NP) may be located within some of the CRF-containing axons. Electron microscopic immunocytochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of CRF, VP and its 'carrier' protein, VP-associated neurophysin (NP-VP) in 100-nm neurosecretory vesicles (NSVs) in axons terminating near the portal capillary plexus in the external zone of the median eminence. If these peptides are extensively co-localized in the same NSVs in the median eminence, then coordinate secretion of CRF and VP in vivo is obligatory, at least in some physiological circumstances. We demonstrate in this report, using post-embedding electron microscopic immunocytochemistry on serial ultrathin sections, that CRF, VP and NP-VP are contained not only in the same axons and terminals, but in the same 100-nm NSVs in the median eminence of both normal and adrenalectomized rats. In addition, in the normal rat median eminence 44% of the CRF-positive axons and terminals stained strongly for VP and NP-VP, whereas in the adrenalectomized rat virtually all the CRF-positive structures in the median eminence showed strong staining for VP and NP-VP, indicating a transformation of one subpopulation of CRF-positive axons and terminals by adrenalectomy.", "PMC1933200": "The techniques of ultrasonographic and hookwire localization biopsy of impalpable breast lesions detected by a large breast screening unit during its first year of operation are described. Hookwire localization (HL) was performed using mammography. Ultrasonographic localization (UL) was used for lesions readily detectable by ultrasonography by marking the skin directly over the lesion and calculating its depth below the surface. UL is not appropriate when microcalcification is the sole mammographic abnormality. Localization was required for 150 of the 191 (78.5 per cent) screen-detected lesions. HL was used for 94 (62.7 per cent) and UL for 56 (37.3 per cent). Four lesions were missed by HL, none by UL; 35 per cent of lesions removed by HL and 39 per cent by UL were malignant, giving benign: malignant biopsy ratios of 1.8:1 and 1.5:1 respectively.

This knowledge changed the way existing drugs were used to control rejection and led to the development of new drugs that could more effectively control the rejection process. Early drug protocols used combinations of azathioprine, antilymphocyte globulin, and steroids. Later protocols used combinations of cyclosporine, steroids, and antithymocyte globulin. After problems related to cyclosporine were identified, protocols came full circle. They now include drugs that were used in earlier protocols, as well as cyclosporine.

Subjects were ten male volunteers, five of whom had above-elbow amputations and had used their prosthetic devices for an average of 8.3 years. The other five subjects were selected from a volunteer pool. Movements were made and measured on a standard linear slide whose cursor had a pulsing infrared diode attached opposite the subject. An infrared camera and microprocessor translated diode movement into a corresponding change in voltage. The voltage was simultaneously applied to an audio device which supplied the augmented feedback. The movement of the cursor by the subject was paralleled by a linearly-related change in audible frequency (Hz). The subjects performed 15 trials at each of three retentions (immediate, 15-sec filled, and 15 sec unfilled), both with and without the augmented feedback, for a total of 90 trials.

Co-culturing of these cells with recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) resulted in the appearance of high amounts of Ia antigens at the cell surface of essentially all cells. The continuous presence of the stimulus was a prerequisite for sustained Ia expression because removal of the stimulus resulted in rapid decline of surface Ia. Two-dimensional (2D) gel analysis (1D isoelectric focusing, 2D sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) of class II molecules synthesized by rIFN-gamma-stimulated bone marrow macrophages (BMM phi) revealed that, in contrast to class II complexes hitherto described, BMM phi-derived I-A and I-E subregion-encoded subunits are synthesized without invariant chains. The invariant chain-deficient alpha,beta heterodimers are expressed at the cell surface in high proportions demonstrating that their correct assembly and transport to the cell surface is accomplished in the absence of invariant chains. The lack of invariant chains appears not to be due to a failure of rIFN-gamma to induce transcription of the gamma-chain gene because rIFN-gamma-induced, in contrast to uninduced, BMM phi accumulate high levels of invariant chain-specific transcripts as evidenced by Northern blot analysis. These findings suggest that translation of gamma-chain-specific mRNA is blocked in BMM phi for as yet unknown reasons. Alternatively, newly synthesized gamma chains might have escaped their regular intracellular maturation pathway as a result of unidentified modifications mediated by altered post-translational processing mechanisms.", "PMC3667779": "On irradiation with short-wavelength UV light in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, methotrexate and its metabolites 7-hydroxymethotrexate and 2,4-diamino-N10-methylpteroic acid are cleaved into highly fluorescent products.

Study of the effect of the mobile phase composition and irradiation time on fluorescence signal intensity showed that a residence time of ca. 3 s in the on-line photochemical reactor was best. The detection limit for methotrexate was 0.4 ng, for 7-hydroxymethotrexate 1.0 ng and for 2,4-diamino-N10-methylpteroic acid 0.6 ng.

Only cigarette smoking was more frequent in men (84 vs 11%, p less than 0.001), being the remaining coronary risk factors more common in women (hypertension 69% vs 37%, p less than 0.001; hypercholesterolemia 46% vs 33%, p less than 0.05, and diabetes mellitus 42% vs 14%, p less than 0.01). In addition, unstable angina was a more frequent indication of coronary angioplasty in women than in men (74% vs 61%, p less than 0.05), whereas coronary angioplasty after intravenous thrombolysis was more frequent in men (12% vs 1%, p less than 0.001). Coronary angioplasty angiographic success (87% vs 91%), and minor (16% vs 10%) or major (5% vs 3%) complications were not statistically different in the two groups. Nevertheless, success of the procedure in the absence of any complication was achieved in a higher percentage (86% vs 76%, p less than 0.05) of men than in their female counterparts. After coronary angioplasty 88% of women had an angiographic follow-up available which yielded a restenosis rate of 41% (vs 32% in men, NS), despite the absence of symptoms in the 89% of these patients in their last visit.

Khat-chewing has a stimulating effect on the central nervous system, which is the reason for the widespread abuse of this plant. From the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, khat-chewing spread from the limited area of the north-western part of Somalia to the whole country, assuming epidemic proportions. Khat-chewing was recognized as a real national problem with adverse consequences for the health and socio-economic development of the country. A law prohibiting the use, importation, cultivation and trade of khat was enacted in 1983, and it has been strongly enforced by a comprehensive national programme that has mobilized the whole country to achieve its objectives. Committees to co-ordinate action on khat control were established at the national, regional and local levels. An information and education campaign through the use of the mass media has been carried out to support the national programme. After the successes achieved in the enforcement of the prohibition law, the national authorities, hampered by a shortage of financial resources, have had major difficulties in providing farmers with adequate compensation for damage caused to them by the destruction of khat plantations. Difficulties were also experienced in coping with the unemployment of those who were involved in the khat business and in establishing the recreational facilities needed to provide healthy social alternatives to khat-chewing sessions.

Diffuse white matter changes are more difficult to explain. These might result from confluence of focal changes, or from diffuse white matter ischemia (incomplete infarct). Alternatively, they may be related to alterations of the transependymal CSF flow.

This investigation evaluated, in one study, whether and to what degree these two mechanisms contribute to the generation of these activity patterns. Summated multiunit discharges were simultaneously recorded from lateral (LN) and medial (MN) sites on the bullfrog's olfactory nerve to sample the mucosal activity occurring near the internal and external nares, respectively. Precisely controlled sniffs of four odorants (benzaldehyde, butanol, geraniol, and octane) were drawn through the frog's olfactory sac in both the forward (H1) and reverse (H2) hale directions. By combining the four resulting measurements, LNH1, LNH2, MNH1, and MNH2, in different mathematical expressions, indexes reflecting the relative effects of the chromatographic process, regional sensitivity, and hale direction could be calculated. Most importantly, the chromatographic process and the regional sensitivity differences both contributed significantly to the mucosal activity patterns. However, their relative roles varied markedly among the four odorants, ranging from complete dominance by either one to substantial contributions from each. In general, the more strongly an odorant was sorbed by the mucosa, the greater was the relative effect of the chromatographic process; the weaker the sorption, the greater the relative effect of regional sensitivity. Similarly, the greater an odorant's sorption, the greater was the effect of hale direction. Other stimulus variables (sniff volume, sniff duration, and the number of molecules within the sniff) had marked effects upon the overall size of the response. For strongly sorbed odorants, the effect of increasing volume was positive; for a weakly sorbed odorant, it was negative. The reverse may be true for duration. In contrast, the effect of increasing the number of molecules was uniformly positive for all four odorants. However, there was little evidence that these other stimulus variables had a major influence upon the effects of the chromatographic process and regional sensitivity differences in their generation of mucosal activity patterns.", "PMC2896714": "Three aspects of surgical hand hygiene have been studied: the attitude of the surgeon, the microbiology of glove changing during an operation, and the use of antiseptic-coated gloves together with different handwash routines.

The morphological features of P. westermani cercaria and redia are described.", "PMC3964992": "A cohort of 431 male cryolite workers employed for at least six months between 1924 and 1961 was identified from personnel records at the Copenhagen cryolite factory. During this period, heavy fluoride exposure resulted in at least 74 cases of skeletal fluorosis. All workmen in the cohort were followed up in Denmark until July 1, 1981. During 1941-1981, 206 men died, while only 149.3 deaths were expected from national mortality statistics. Significant excesses were seen in the following causes of death: violent death and all cancers, in particular cancer of the respiratory system. When compared with specific mortality rates for the Copenhagen area, violent death (and suicide taken alone) remained in significant excess among employees hired before 1940. Cancer morbidity data for the 35-year period 1943-1977 showed 78 cases of malignant neoplasms in the cryolite workers against 53.2 expected for Denmark as a whole and 67.9 for Copenhagen. The excess was almost entirely due to an excess number of respiratory cancers. Cancer morbidity showed no apparent correlation with length of employment or time from first exposure. Because detailed information on predictors for respiratory cancer was unavailable, a possible residual effect of fluoride cannot be excluded. However, any major carcinogenic effect of heavy fluoride exposure would be very unlikely.", "PMC3149649": "1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) was quantitated by use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in brains and livers of marmosets which showed parkinsonism after daily subcutaneous injection of TIQ. TIQ showed greatly increased levels in the brains and livers of the TIQ-treated marmosets, with no detectable metabolites of TIQ. TIQ was present as an endogenous amine in the brains and livers of saline-treated marmosets at very low concentrations. It thus seems that TIQ can pass easily through the blood-brain barrier but cannot be metabolized in the brain or the liver. It is possible that TIQ accumulated in the brain may produce parkinsonism.", "PMC2745692": "Isolates from five patients with genitourinary infections diagnosed over a 7-week period were identified as CDC group HB-5. The organisms caused clinical presentations of pelvic inflammatory disease in three women and urethritis in the only male in the series. The remaining patient received surgical treatment for a Bartholin gland abscess. Since the clinical and temporal presentations were remarkable and the questions of sexual mode of transmission and strain relatedness were of concern, the five strains were examined further by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and ribosomal DNA typing. Overall, the five clinical isolates were more closely related to each other than to the control strains. This is the first report describing genitourinary infections caused by group HB-5. While the pathophysiology of group HB-5 infections remains to be fully elucidated, the possibility that this organism may be sexually transmitted deserves further study.", "PMC2994781": "The effect of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on hematopoietic recovery after marrow-ablative chemoradiotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was studied in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of high-grade malignancy and in patients with acute leukemia. The recovery of platelets after autologous BMT occurred significantly quicker in CMV-negative patients than in CMV-positive patients (platelets greater than 50,000 per cubic millimeter after 21 1/2 v 40 days, respectively). No differences in the recovery of neutrophils were found between those with or without CMV infection. CMV-positive patients required significantly more transfusion support with thrombocyte concentrates than CMV-negative patients (three v six thrombocyte concentrates). In conclusion, CMV infections do not influence neutrophil recovery but do delay platelet recovery. As a consequence, patients with a CMV infection, whether primary, reactivated, or latent, require more thrombocyte concentrates, which increases the risk of transfusion-related infections.", "PMC2773427": "Blood lipids, peroxidation of lipids, inflammation mediators were examined in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Three trials significantly favored drug vs placebo, four showed a trend towards drug vs placebo, two showed no difference and two showed a trend towards placebo vs drug. The combined results of these 11 trials showed a statistically significant improvement with dipyridamole. Although this result should be viewed with caution because of methodologic variations in the studies, the available evidence appears to suggest that dipyridamole may have a beneficial effect, and that it may have been prematurely discarded in the treatment of angina pectoris.", "PMC3178540": "High-speed, high-resolution data (frontal plane) were collected from 6 Sprague-Dawley rats by opto-electronic mandibular tracking (OMT), followed by microcomputer analysis of individual chew cycles. Mastication comprised rapidly alternating, unilateral cycles with variable degrees of lateral translation. There was no evidence of bilateral mastication (simultaneous chewing on both left and right sides). Analysis revealed significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) differences between whole-cycle, slow-open (SO) phase, fast-open (FO) phase, fast-close (FC) phase, and slow-close (SC) phase duration, height, width, and velocity during mastication of standardized foods (pellets and slurry). Regression analysis between millimetres of vertical/horizontal movement (Y) and vertical/horizontal velocity (X) revealed differences during these mastications. Whole-cycle and SO-phase regression equations had the greatest disparity between pellet and slurry chewing for both vertical and horizontal movements. Correlation coefficient analysis between movement and velocity data indicated that (1) vertical correlations were smaller than horizontal ones, (2) slurry correlations were greater than pellet ones except for whole cycles, (3) FO phase had the largest movement/velocity correlation during both pellet and slurry mastication, and, that (4) SC phase had the smallest movement/velocity correlation. Vertical and horizontal movements during pellet FC phase were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) greater than slurry ones; both vertical and horizontal movements during pellet SC phase were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) less than slurry ones.

In spite of an initial histological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma from the biopsy material, the correct diagnosis of atypical carcinoid was made by sputum cytology. The carcinoid cells had exfoliated into the sputum collected immediately after bronchofiberscopic examination although the bronchial tissues obtained at this time did not reveal any histological findings suggestive of neoplasia. The distinctive cytological features in sputum of atypical carcinoid that differentiate it from small cell carcinoma are considered to be the relatively abundant vesicular cytoplasm and the finely reticular or granular chromatin pattern observed in well-preserved tumor cells. The present case also suggests that clinical data may be indispensable to the differential cytological diagnosis of such tumors.", "PMC1638051": "Quantitative estimations of perimeter and area from digitized video images, and the application of these features in morphometry, are discussed.

The procedure is applied to sort into normal and abnormal categories, human left ventricles (LV) using in vivo data from 19 subjects (ten normal and nine abnormal LV's) studied by ultrafast tomography (Cine-CT). The procedure starts by utilizing a vector in a helical coordinate system to describe the spatial geometry of each individual LV cavity. This individual vector is then anatomically aligned and normalized to eliminate effects due to size, yielding a dimensionless vector, denoted as \"geometrical cardiogram\" (GCG). The GCG characterizes the instantaneous 3-D geometrical information of the individual LV. For the group of healthy subjects, the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) is then applied to compress the geometric information contained in their individuals' GCG vectors, at end diastole (ED) and end systole (ES), and yield a unique set of basis vectors. The \"normal shape domain\" is next defined as a truncated set of the KLT basis vectors from which a normal GCG can be reconstructed with a mean squared error (MSE) smaller than a defined threshold. The calculated MSE of any individual GCG reconstructed in this domain is then used as a criterion for sorting the 3-D shapes. Hearts which yield MSE greater than the threshold are considered abnormal. When applied to the study group of 19 subjects a significant difference (p less than 0.0001) between the MSE values obtained for the normal LV's, and those obtained for the abnormal LV's was detected, thus leading to a successful sorting of all the studied LV's. Finally, the KLT is applied to yield a compact representation of the 3-D geometry of any LV (normal or abnormal).", "PMC1410914": "On lines of human (HeLa) and monkey (BS-C-1) cell cultures, the cytotoxicity of 15 products of dental use for radicular and coronary fillings, alloys and endodontic antiseptics was analysed.

The liberated elastin peptides such as K-elastin possess various biological activities: They are chemotactic for monocytes and fibroblasts, stimulate the oxidative burst and the intracellular free Ca2+ mobilisation through the phosphatidylinositol (PIP2) breakdown in PMNLs. It was found that the PIP2 breakdown induced by K-elastin is a pertussis toxin sensitive process in PMNLs of young subjects. In the case of the elderly, the K-elastin-induced oxidative burst, intracellular free Ca2+ elevation was less than in young, and could not be inhibited by pertussis toxin. Studying the K-elastin-induced inositol phosphate (IP) formation in PMNLs of elderly a disturbed PIP2 breakdown was found. K-elastin stimulated the IP formation at a very low level in PMNLs of elderly. This alteration of the second messenger formation (e.g. IP3 and Ca2+) after KE stimulation, might be the consequence of their originally elevated levels in resting PMNLs of elderly.", "PMC2781108": "The usefulness of routine intrapericardial pressure determination and hemodynamic monitoring during therapeutic (n = 22) or diagnostic (n = 2) pericardiocentesis was analyzed. Hemodynamic data confirmed the presence of cardiac tamponade in all cases, including the 2 patients without clinical suspicion. Prior to fluid evacuation, abnormally elevated levels of intrapericardial (13 +/- 5 mmHg), right atrial (14 +/- 4 mmHg) and pulmonary capillary (16 +/- 3 mmHg) pressures were observed. A significant correlation was found between intrapericardial and right atrial pressures (r = 0.97, p less than 0.05) and also between intrapericardial and pulmonary capillary pressures (r = 0.69, p less than 0.05). The basal cardiac output was low (3 +/- 1 l/min) and increased after the pericardiocentesis in all but one patient. According to the results of pericardiocentesis, patients were classified into three groups. Group I: intrapericardial and right atrial pressures decreased to normal levels. The increment of cardiac output was high (72%) and the procedure was considered successful. Group II: right atrial and intrapericardial pressures remained elevated (7.7 +/- 4 and 7 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively) and the cardiac output increment was less marked (52%), thus indicating incomplete drainage. Group III: intrapericardial pressure decreased to normal levels but right atrial pressure remained elevated. All these patients were found to have associated cardiac disease, most frequently constriction. We conclude that routine determination of intrapericardial pressure: 1) reveals the presence of tamponade in cases without clinical suspicion; 2) indicates the efficacy of drainage; and 3) together with right atrial pressure recording, provides early diagnosis of associated cardiac disease, especially effusive-constrictive pericarditis.", "PMC3184956": "The spontaneous regression of a malignant tumor subsequent to surgical excision of a distant cancer is a fascinating observation. Although rare, this dynamic tumor/host relationship may offer important insight into mechanisms of immunologic surveillance.

In nine out of 10 patients with evidence of partial autonomous blast cell growth. IL-1 further stimulated cell growth in both suspension culture and in a clongenic assay. IL-1 also stimulated cell growth in two out of three cases with no evidence of autonomous growth whereas no additional stimulation was observed in two cases with totally autonomous growth. In blast cells stimulated by IL-1, synthesis of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was increased and the proliferative response to IL-1 was inhibited by an antibody to GM-CSF. In all samples with evidence of autonomous growth, blast cell conditioned medium (BCCM) contained IL-1 activity (range 0.7-74.2 units ml) and a polyclonal antibody to IL-1 markedly inhibited autonomous growth in four samples. BCCM from three of these four samples contained GM-CSF, the synthesis of which was suppressed when BCCM was prepared in the presence of anti-IL-1. Our data suggests that endogenous IL-1 is an important factor in the regulation of the production of GM-CSF and hence of autonomous growth of AML blasts, but that other mechanisms regulating GM-CSF production may exist.", "PMC3513839": "The Arrhenius kinetics for the synthesis of var1, which is a hydrophilic protein of the mitochondrial ribosomes, have been compared to that of other mitochondrial translation products, which are hydrophobic subunits of the respiratory enzyme complexes.

The chromosome banding pattern of the four populations was identical and conformed to the standard chromosome map of A. aquasalis from Brazil. These results suggest that the population from Santa Fe and Guayana, considered to be A. emilianus, is conspecific with A. aquasalis.

In addition, we have used PLT reagents to define a new LD specificity, LD-MN2, that is associated with DR2 and is found significantly more frequently in DR2+ IDD patients than in DR2+ normals.

The cells were detached with EDTA and trypsin, suspended in EMEM with 10% calf serum and studied with time-lapse, phase-contrast cinematography in suspension and during attachment and spreading. Cells were fixed and prepared for light microscopy while in suspension and during the spreading process. They were also prepared for scanning and transmission electron microscopy at different times during spreading. The projected areas of stained cells, in suspension and at different stages of spreading, were measured morphometrically and the results compared statistically. The glial cells in suspension were often found to retain somewhat their shape from the previous monolayer. They spread radially outwards with even lamellar cytoplasm and peripheral ruffling, as a group more quickly than the malignant glioma cells. They also became polarized and started to translocate in a shorter time. The glioma cells were spherical in suspension and characterized by pronounced blebbing of the cell surface. Blebbing continued during spreading and was finally replaced by ruffling at the edge. The cells spread like the glial cells radially outwards but the lamellar cytoplasm was occasionally somewhat irregular. Cells from the glioma lines spread as groups slower than the glial cells but with individual rates for the different lines. One of the glioma lines appeared to spread more thinly than the glial cells. Cells which sedimented on top of other cells could not spread.

It was hypothesized that the right hemisphere is specialized to become activated by and to process negative affective stimuli, and that this specialization may play a role in the co-occurrence of depression and pain. The relationship between depression, experimental pain, and cerebral laterality was investigated in 16 depressed and 16 nondepressed, right-handed, female students. Cerebral laterality was measured via tasks assessing visual and auditory biases, and pain was assessed via a cold pressor task. The proposition that the right hemisphere mediates the co-occurrence of pain and depression was not supported, but specific findings did suggest that the right hemisphere may play a unique role in pain perception. Data from the visual task indicated that prior exposure to pain results in increased right hemisphere activation as indicated by a left visual field bias. Pain perception was a complex function of mood, preceding tasks, and the hand tested, and it was suggested that exposure to a typical right-hemisphere task increased the left side lateralization of pain in nondepressed subjects. Implications of these findings are discussed for coexisting problems of pain and depression and for the lateralization of pain in disorders judged to involve a significant psychogenic component.", "PMC3042988": "Two \"Maryland bridges\" replacing anterior teeth fused to the facial surface of the abutments are described.", "PMC3501574": "We undertook a prospective study of children from three to 24 months of age with rectal temperatures of greater than or equal to 40.0 degrees C (104.0 degrees F) to determine if children whose fevers fail to respond to antipyretic therapy are more likely to be bacteremic than children whose fevers are lowered by antipyretic measures. Children from two clinical settings were studied: primarily black lower-class children at an inner-city hospital (n = 188) and primarily white middle-class children at a suburban hospital (n = 45). We found an overall prevalence of bacteremia of 7.3%, which was not statistically different between two hospitals. A response to antipyretic therapy, defined as a decrease in temperature of at least 1 degrees C, was seen in 83.7% of children.

These proteins--FlaW, FlaU, and FlaV--are believed to be assembled in this order at the distal end of the hook. When the recipient hooks were provided by flaU mutants, whose hook tips contained FlaW only, exogenous FlaU was essential for polymerization of both exogenous and endogenous flagellin, whereas exogenous FlaV inhibited such polymerization. When the recipients were flaV-mutant hooks, whose tips contained FlaW and FlaU but not FlaV, exogenous FlaV inhibited polymerization of exogenous flagellin. FlaV also inhibited polymerization of exogenous flagellin at the tips of filament fragments. In contrast, FlaV was essential for polymerization of endogenous flagellin onto flaV-mutant hooks, and onto short filaments that had been made (in the absence of FlaV) by polymerization of exogenous flagellin on the tips of flaV-mutant hooks. These results suggest that FlaV acts not only at the tip of the hook to initiate growth of the filament, but also at the tip of the growing filament, and that FlaV is essential for polymerization of endogenous flagellin--i.e., for the normal process of filament assembly in vivo.", "PMC555765": "During the span from 50 to 100 days and beyond, the male stroke-prone Okamoto rat develops systolic blood pressure measures in excess of 200 mm Hg.

When analyzed as pressure-flow relationships, there was no significant change after nifedipine, indicating that the fall in blood flow could be accounted for by the reduction in perfusion pressure. Four of the placebo group developed Raynaud's phenomenon after the baseline study, whereas none developed Raynaud's phenomenon after nifedipine. Our results suggest that although nifedipine may reduce vascular reactivity, caution is warranted in use of this drug in patients with threatened digital ischemia because of the possibility that digital blood flow may be reduced.", "PMC3292680": "Infective endocarditis usually occurs in patients who have had previous cardiac damage or who have congenitally abnormal hearts. However, this infection may afflict otherwise normal individuals, and it is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus. In these individuals, interactions between circulating microorganisms and resident cardiac endothelial cells may initiate the infection. In the present studies we established an assay to measure in vitro binding of S. aureus to porcine cardiac valve endothelial cells. We found that this interaction was specific and saturable with respect to time. In contrast, there was no specific binding of Escherichia coli, an organism that rarely causes endocarditis. Exogenous fibronectin had no effect on specific binding of S. aureus, and heat-killed organisms adhered equally well as viable bacteria. Fixation of the endothelial cells with formalin abolished all specific binding. Soluble components from bacterial extracts inhibited S. aureus binding in dose-dependent fashion. These observations suggest that circulating S. aureus may interact with specific sites on cardiac endothelial cells, thereby potentially initiating infective endocarditis.", "PMC2504300": "The effects of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and its putative intracellular mediators on progesterone (P) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) formation were studied in rat granulosa cells. A calcium ionophore (A23187), 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and melittin (a phospholipase A2-stimulator) were used to later intracellular calcium, protein kinase C, and arachidonic acid levels, respectively. During a 5-h incubation, LHRH increased basal P levels but failed to affect the formation of P induced by cholera toxin (CT). On the other hand, both basal and CT-stimulated PGE2 formation were increased by LHRH. Treatment of the cells with A23187 or TPA attenuated the formation of P induced by CT or FSH. By contrast, A23187 or TPA significantly augmented CT- or FSH-stimulated PGE2 formation. Interestingly, the effects of A23187 and TPA on PGE2 were synergistic, whether or not FSH or CT was present during the incubation. This synergy was not observed with regard to P formation. Melittin also increased basal P and PGE2 levels, and enhanced the stimulation of PGE2 by A23187 or TPA. However, in the combined presence of A23187 and TPA, melittin failed to further enhance the high levels of PGE2 accumulated. These findings further support a role for the intracellular calcium, protein kinase C, and arachidonic acid metabolic pathways in the multiple actions of LHRH in the ovary.", "PMC4008436": "Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) hepatocytes were isolated using a two-step perfusion through the portal vein. A typical perfusion yielded 2.92 X 10(6) liver cells with a mean viability of 96.3%. Hepatocytes comprised 93.4% of the total cell isolate. Survival of hepatocytes in suspension culture was dependent on fetal bovine serum concentration and temperature of incubation. Serum concentrations of 5, 10, and 20% produced the highest survival during primary culture. Hepatocyte survival was in inverse proportion to the incubation temperature. Trout hepatocyte DNA synthesis and mitosis decreased during the culture period. Cytochrome p450 activity decreased rapidly during the first 2 d of culture and then remained low but measurable during the remaining 8 d of culture. Culture temperature also influenced the p450 activity with lower temperatures producing greater activity. Morphologic changes occurred in the cells during culture. Isolated hepatocytes self-aggregated, forming strands and clumps that increased in size with time in culture. Junctional complexes between cells were evident within the aggregates. Nuclear atypia, increases in size and number of autophagic vacuoles, and the appearance of bundles of intermediate filaments also were observed with increased time in culture.", "PMC2074251": "Immunomodulation by antibacterial agents shows promise as a novel strategy in the treatment of infectious diseases. Cefodizime, a new oxi-imino-amino-2-thiazolyl cephalosporin, is a particularly good candidate in this context. In-vivo models of experimental infections show that prophylactic administration of cefodizime increases the survival of some strains of mice after challenge with Toxoplasma gondii or Candida albicans; its curative effect in infections due to members of the Enterobacteriaceae is better than that expected from in-vitro MIC determinations relative to other third-generation cephalosporins; this effect is even more marked in immunocompromised animals. Data obtained both in vivo and ex vivo show that cefodizime enhances various immune parameters such as phagocyte function, B lymphocyte responsiveness and delayed hypersensitivity; it may restore natural killer (NK) and phagocyte activity, as well as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interferon production, in immunocompromised patients and animals. The in-vitro effects of this drug include enhancement of phagocyte bactericidal activity and alteration of bacterial virulence factors. The chemical basis for these various immunomodulatory properties is related to the thio-thiazolyl side-chain at position 3 of the cephem nucleus. To date, the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory properties of cefodizime have not been identified clearly, but it is likely that it interferes at different levels of specific and non-specific immune defences.", "PMC4009826": "We present 9 consecutive patients who underwent insertion of the Mentor inflatable penile prosthesis. Of these patients 3 had successful results after repeated problems with the Scott inflatable penile prosthesis. Complications included spontaneous inflation of the prosthesis, a tubing kink, aneurysmal cylinder ballooning and cylinder disruption. Slow deflation seems to be an inherent problem with the Mentor system. Although penile squeezing may be used to help deflation, traumatic urethritis may occur. However, concealment may not be possible without such squeezing. Interim use of a noninflatable prosthesis to treat a damaged corpus cavernosum is recommended. Although ingenious technology has enabled successful implant surgery, no penile prosthesis yet devised has proven to be ideal. Further refinements are being made. Ultimate evaluation will require years of followup in the spirit of the pre-700 series of Scott inflatable penile prostheses.", "PMC3366972": "A new case of spinal cord compression secondary to steroid-induced epidural lipomatosis is reported in a patient treated for dermatomyositis.

The development of epidural lipomatosis does not require a preexisting lipoma and may occur in a previously normal spine.", "PMC3281007": "Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF) has been reported to increase the leukocyte count in subhuman primates subjected to total-body irradiation and in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We administered this substance to 19 patients with breast cancer or melanoma treated with high-dose combination chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support. Groups of three or four patients were treated with 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, or 32.0 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day of glycosylated rHuGM-CSF by continuous intravenous infusion for 14 days, beginning three hours after bone marrow infusion. Total leukocyte and granulocyte recovery was accelerated in these patients as compared with 24 historical controls matched for age, diagnosis, and treatment. Leukocyte counts (mean +/- SD) obtained 14 days after transplantation were 1511 +/- 1003 per microliter in patients given 2 to 8 micrograms per kilogram per day, 2575 +/- 2304 in those given 16 micrograms, and 3120 +/- 1744 in those given 32 micrograms, as compared with 863 +/- 645 per microliter in the controls. No consistent effect on platelet counts was noted. Toxic effects were generally mild and not clearly dose-related in patients given 2 to 16 micrograms per kilogram per day. Edema, weight gain, or myalgias occurred in all patients given 32 micrograms per kilogram; marked weight gain, generalized edema, pleural effusions, and hypotension developed in two patients, one of whom also had acute renal failure. Our results indicate that rHuGM-CSF can accelerate myeloid recovery after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation, over a range of doses that can be tolerated. In this setting the ability to increase the dose is limited by the development of myalgias and fluid retention.", "PMC3484861": "CT has proven to be excellent in identifying orbital pathology responsible for proptosis. Occasionally, no discrete mass or extraocular muscle enlargement to explain the exophthalmos is found, only an appearance suggestive of an abnormal increase in orbital fat volume. Fifteen patients were studied with proptosis apparently resulting from increased orbital fat. Clinical follow-up revealed that four of them had Graves orbitopathy, unilateral in one; two had Cushing disease/syndrome; and nine were obese without endocrinopathy. The orbital volume and percentage orbital fat volume were measured by CT software analysis in these patients and in a control group of 16 patients without proptosis. Measurements of proptosis and thickness of the scalp fat pad at the inion level were also performed. Significantly greater values for orbital fat volume, percentage fat volume, and proptosis were found in the proptosis group compared with the control group. There was excellent correlation between proptosis and percentage fat volume, supporting the contention that increased orbital fat is responsible for the proptosis. The thickness of the scalp fat pad at the inion level was significantly greater in obese and Cushing patients than in control subjects, but the thickness was not significantly greater in Graves patients than in controls. Proptosis and inion fat were well correlated (r = 0.74) in the control and obese patients, which suggests a relation between general body fat and orbital fat volume.", "PMC2408586": "Electron microscopy performed in a young girl suffering from keratitis, ichthyosis, and deafness syndrome showed pathologic storage of glycogen in various types of tissues.

CT findings were recorded following general rules for surgical and pathological studies on cancer of biliary tract proposed by Japanese society of biliary surgery. Serosal invasion (S factor), direct hepatic invasion (H inf factor), lymph node metastasis (N factor), bile duct invasion (B factor), duodenal invasion (Du factor) and finally preoperative staging diagnosis were included in this study. Conclusion is as follows. 1) False positive results were predominating in S and H inf factor, sensitivity was 76.0% and 50.0% respectively. 2) In B factor, the result was poor, the sensitivity 44.4%. 3) In N factor, CT was effective, the sensitivity 77.6%. 4) Finally it was concluded that CT can play an important role in staging diagnosis of gallbladder cancer, the sensitivity was 93.1%.", "PMC2921494": "A 37-year-old man with a 30-year history of recurrent anorectal ulceration developed a hemangiosarcoma of the rectum.

The main indication for use of nitrous oxide/oxygen sedation is fear-anxiety. The equipment used is a continuous flow machine with a fail safe system set at a minimum of 30 or 40 per cent oxygen. A standardized sedation technique starting with administration of 100 per cent oxygen, is recommended. The concentration of nitrous oxide is then slowly increased and individually set, mostly between 30 and 50 per cent. In most cases the analgesia produced by nitrous oxide is not sufficient to ensure pain-free dental treatment. The sedation must therefore be supplemented by local anaesthesia. Side effects, e.g. restlessness, vomiting, and nausea are infrequent. About 90 per cent patients, who have difficulty in co-operating during dental treatment, mainly because of anxiety, show excellent or fair co-operation during nitrous oxide/oxygen sedation. Occupational exposure to nitrous oxide can be minimized by the use of scavenging systems, local exhaust systems, careful sedation technique, and equipment management.", "PMC1796901": "In synaptosomes of the rat striatum the dopamine uptake was measured in a concentration range of 0.03 microM to 100 microM.

According to these findings a novel model for the dopamine uptake is proposed. Its main assumption is one carrier with two dopamine binding sites.", "PMC2133063": "Intravenous injection of beta-endorphin antiserum (AS) with antibody titres of 1:1,600, 1:3,200, 1:12,800, and 1:20,000 decreased the voltage threshold in the tail-shock test (electrocutaneous nociceptive stimulus) in rats for 2 days, after which time control levels were regained. In the case of AS of titres 1:12,800 and 1:20,000 this threshold then increased to above control levels for about 40 and 100 days, respectively. This effect was abolished by naloxone. In the same rats, an injection of AS of titre 1:1,600 did not alter the latency of the tail-flick test (thermal nociceptive stimulus) but AS of titres 1:3,200, 1:12,800, and 1:20,000 decreased it for 1-4 h, the actual length of time being titre-dependent. After control levels had been regained, there was no further change in latency in the tail-flick test in the subsequent 42 days. Injection with preimmune serum did not change either voltage threshold or latency in the two tail-stimulation tests in control rats. Thus the hyperalgesic short-term effect seen in response to treatment with beta-endorphin AS was more pronounced in response to an electrocutaneous stimulus than to a thermal one, and the long-term selective analgesic effect was present in response to rats given electrocutaneous stimulation but not to thermal stimulation. It is proposed that beta-endorphin AS has a two-stage selective effect: a reduction in beta-endorphin release followed by a 'rebound' increase.", "PMC2987814": "We have analysed the mRNAs which map within the short unique (US) region of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome. US has a total length of 12979 base pairs (1) and is extensively transcribed with approximately 94% of the total sequence present in cytoplasmic mRNAs and 79% of the total sequence considered to be protein coding. There are several examples of overlapping functions and multiple use of DNA sequence within this region. US contains 12 genes (1) which are expressed as 13 mRNAs. Two of these mRNAs are thought to arise from the same gene since they differ only slightly in the positions of their 5' ends and probably specify the same polypeptide. 11 of the 13 mRNAs are arranged into four nested families with unique 5' ends and common 3' co-termini.

Complete data on variables of interest were available for 3617 colon cancer patients (2545 Caucasians and 1072 Blacks) and 1528 rectal cancer patients (1179 Caucasians and 349 Blacks). No significant difference was observed between the races with respect to either the follow-up time or the censoring pattern. For each site, Caucasian patients had a lower risk of death at any time point compared to Black patients, and this difference was maintained within categories of disease stage, sex, age and SES. The race effect was statistically significant in all multivariate models. Moreover, only race was significant in models that considered both race and SES.

Treatment of quiescent cultures of rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells with okadaic acid induced marked activation of a kinase activity that phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 2 and myelin basic protein, but not histone or casein, in vitro. This activated kinase eluted at approximately 0.15 M NaCl on a DEAE-cellulose column and its apparent molecular mass was determined to be approximately 40 kDa by gel filtration. Detection of the kinase activity in polyacrylamide gels containing substrate proteins after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis revealed that the okadaic-acid-activated kinase activity resided mainly in two closely related polypeptides with apparent molecular mass approximately 40 kDa. The characteristics of this kinase were indistinguishable from those of the mitogen-activated MAP kinase in the same cells. The okadaic-acid-activated MAP kinase was deactivated by protein phosphatase 2A treatment in vitro. These results suggest that MAP kinase is negatively regulated by protein phosphatases 1 and/or 2A in quiescent cells and therefore can be activated by inhibiting these protein phosphatases. Interestingly, the okadaic-acid-induced activation of MAP kinase was transient and epidermal-growth-factor-induced activation was also transient, even in the presence of okadaic acid. These data may imply that protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are not involved in the deactivation of MAP kinase in cells.", "PMC2987813": "We have found that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells contain an ATP-dependent topoisomerase activity that supercoils circular DNA in vitro. Subsequent addition of a type I topoisomerase eliminates the supercoils. Like bacterial gyrase, this activity is inhibited by low concentrations of novobiocin (less than 0.1 microM) and by nalidixic acid (less than 0.1 microM). We have examined the effects of these topoisomerase inhibitors on accumulation of various chloroplast transcripts in vivo. Novobiocin differentially affected such transcripts; some transcripts became more abundant while many others were reduced in the presence of this drug. Nalidixic acid on the other hand caused many transcripts to become more abundant albeit to varying degrees. Inhibitors of this algal topoisomerase specifically stimulate a family of related transcripts which we have previously shown to be under light-dark control. We discuss how the inhibitors of this topoisomerase might exert their in vivo effects.", "PMC2724296": "The effects of 8-phenyl and 8-cycloalkyl substituents on the activity of theophylline, caffeine, 1,3-dipropylxanthine, 1,3-dipropyl-7-methylxanthine, 3-propylxanthine, and 1-propylxanthine at A1 adenosine receptors of rat brain and fat cells and at A2 adenosine receptors of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and human platelets are compared. An 8-phenyl substituent has little effect on the activity of caffeine or 1,3-dipropyl-7-methylxanthine at adenosine receptors, while markedly increasing activity of theophylline, 1,3-dipropylxanthine, 1-isoamyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 1-methylxanthine, and 3-propylxanthine. 8-Phenyl-1-propylxanthine is potent (Ki = 20-70 nM) at all receptors. A p-carboxy or p-sulfo substituent, which is introduced on the 8-phenyl ring to increase water solubility, in most cases decreases the activity and selectivity for the A1 receptor. Among the 8-p-sulfo analogues, only 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline and 1,3-dipropyl-8-(p-sulfophenyl)xanthine are selective for the A1 receptors. 8-p-Sulfophenyl derivatives of caffeine, 1,3-dipropyl-7-methylxanthine, and 3-propylxanthine are somewhat selective for the A2 receptors. 8-Cycloalkyl substituents (cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl) markedly increase activity of caffeine and 1,3-dipropyl-7-methylxanthine at the A2 receptor. 8-Cyclohexylcaffeine is potent (Ki = 190 nM) and very selective for the human platelet A2 receptors, but is not as selective for the rat PC12 cell A2 receptor. Such A2 selectivity is in contrast to the marked A1 selectivity of 8-cycloalkyltheophyllines and 8-cycloalkyl-1,3-dipropulxanthines.

Malabsorption was common in the patients with diarrhea and weight loss, as shown by abnormal D-xylose and 14C-glycerol-tripalmitin absorption tests. In these patients, duodenal biopsy specimens showed a histiocytic infiltrate containing numerous acid-fast organisms in 5 and a mild-moderate chronic inflammation in 13.

In the adult, premenopausal woman, the endometrium follows a precisely programmed series of morphologic and physiologic events, characterized by growth, secretory differentiation, and in the absence of conception, degeneration and regeneration. Proliferation, secretion and degeneration are confined to the upper functionalis layer, whereas the lower basalis layer is the seat of regenerative endometrium. In the postmenopausal years, absence of biologically significant estrogenic stimulation leads to progressive endometrial involution, from proliferative to inactive in the mid-50s to atrophy in the late-60s. Cyclic endometrial alterations are controlled by the ovarian estrogens and progesterone via their respective endometrial intranuclear receptors, and possibly other peptides and enzymes. They provide appropriate environment for the implanting conceptus.

The sensitivity to modifiers was increased by membrane energization, and the uncoupling was reversed by membrane-permeable thiol compounds when modifiers other than alkylating agents were used to uncouple. The present paper demonstrates that there exists in the F0 of bovine ATP synthase another set of essential thiols, whose modification results in reversible inhibition of ATPase activity. These thiols are most susceptible to modification by mercurials (p-chloromercuribenzoate greater than p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate) and do not appear to be modified by N-ethylmaleimide. The reversible modification of these thiols by mercurials protects the ATP synthase against irreversible inhibition in F0 by N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The possible location of these two sets of thiols in the F0 of bovine ATP synthase is discussed.", "PMC3032639": "A significant serum level of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance (DLIS) (greater than or equal to 0.5 ng/ml) has been found in healthy full-term neonates, in prematurely born neonates as well as in full-term but small for gestational age neonates. Neither the babies nor their mothers had received digoxin therapy. On the first day of life, the incidence of serum levels of DLIS greater than or equal to 0.5 ng/ml in the three groups of neonates were respectively 64% (32/50), 42% (8/19) and 77% (10/13). Longitudinal measurements in preterm and small for gestational age neonates indicate a progressive disappearance of DLIS from their serum, none of them having a significant serum level at 21 days of age. As long as the chemical structure, origin and physiological properties of DLIS remain unknown, clinicians must be cautious in interpreting the serum levels of digoxin used for therapeutical purpose in neonates.", "PMC5120087": "Single receptor units in the compound eye of the horseshoe crab were illuminated, and their impulse discharges were recorded without removing the eye from the animal. The receptors were spontaneously active in darkness and responded without saturation over a light intensity range of 10(10) to 1. When the eye was excised, the receptors did not discharge in darkness and had an intensity range of 10(5) to 1, as is usually found. Experiments show that these and other differences result from cutting off the blood supply to the eye when it is excised. In addition, the range and shape of the intensity characteristic suggest that more than one receptor mechanism encodes light intensity in this eye.", "PMC2278112": "Death rates from colorectal cancer in Northern Ireland are higher than in most of the rest of the United Kingdom. Although local surgeons have recognised this problem for some time it has remained unclear whether this reflects a greater underlying incidence or a worse mortality. We have reviewed all histological diagnoses of colorectal cancer in the province over a three year period and we report the incidence and site distribution for this disease in this population of one and a half million. With the exception of rectal cancer in females the incidence of colorectal cancer, whether histologically diagnosed or registered, is higher than in England, Wales or Scotland. The site distribution accords with that in other high risk countries.

A maximum color change from blue to yellow was not obtained not even when large numbers of bacteria were used. Samples of stimulated saliva and plaque samples from people with different salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were inoculated into the test medium.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for cytogenetic analysis. Selected immune and haematological parameters were also investigated. The results of these studies showed no statistically significant difference between the group of plant workers and the control group in respect of any of the biological parameters investigated in this study. Nevertheless, duration of employment in EO manufacturing was positively correlated (p less than 0.05) with the frequency of chromosome breaks and with the percentage of neutrophils in a differential white blood cell count and negatively correlated (p less than 0.05) with the percentage of lymphocytes. As the values of these parameters remained within the normal limits of control populations, the correlations were considered to have no significance for health. Atmospheric concentrations of EO were determined using personnel air samplers and were generally below the detection limit (less than 0.05 ppm) during stable plant operations, although transient concentrations of up to 8 ppm were occasionally recorded. The amount of alkylation (2-hydroxyethyl groups) of the Nt atom of histidinyl residues in haemoglobin was also measured in an attempt to gauge recent individual exposures to EO. Variable but, in most instances, readily measurable amounts of Nt-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-L-histidine (Nt represents the N3 atom of histidine) were found in the haemoglobin of plant workers and in the control group who had not knowingly been exposed to an exogenous source of EO.

There exists a significant statistical value for the lower tda angle in the right hand, in the MZ phenotypes of alpha 1 antitrypsin bearers, with P less than 0.05 significance. In the left hand there are many individual values that are identical (62% of the total test effected) thus the statistical methods cannot be applied satisfactorily, bearing in mind the significant difference as the statistical group recognized.

Tryptic peptide mapping of chondroitinase-treated DS-PG and CS-PGs indicated that the peptide patterns observed with the two core molecules from CS-PGs were identical with each other but distinct from the peptide pattern of the DS-PG core molecule. It is likely therefore that the two forms of CS-PGs are derived from the same gene product by post-translational modification or partial degradation, but DS-PG is derived from a distinct gene product. Comparison of the concentration (hexuronate/DNA) of the proteoglycans in newborn and fetal rat skin showed an age-related change in proteoglycan composition; at 4 days before birth, the uronic acid proportions, DS-PG:CS-PGs, were about 14:1 and during the next 4 days, DS-PG increased 2.2-fold whereas CS-PGs decreased 4-fold. On a per DNA basis, the rate of [3H]serine incorporation into CS-PGs was 2.5 times the rate for DS-PG at 4 days before birth but decreased by 95% during the next 4 days. The rate for DS-PG also decreased but to a much lesser extent, so that by 2 days before birth, it began to exceed the rate for CS-PGs. The striking change in the concentration and labeling rate of CS-PGs can be interpreted either as a decrease of CS-PGs synthesis, or as an increase of CS-PGs breakdown, or both, a process which might be involved in the transition of extracellular matrix from a fetal type to a newborn or adult type.", "PMC3931302": "The effect of a selective thromboxane (TX) synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046), alone and in combination with a very low dose of aspirin, on the platelet function was studied in healthy and diseased subjects. A single dose of 100 mg OKY-046 was orally administered to patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and healthy volunteers. TXB2 generation and platelet aggregation were measured before and at 1, 4, 6 and 8hr after dosing. In addition, after the administration of a very low dose of aspirin (0.1-0.25 mg/kg/day) for at least one month, a single dose of OKY-046 was given to CVD patients. TXB2 generation and platelet aggregation were measured in the same manner as OKY-046 alone. The effect of OKY-046 on platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (AA) was different in each subject whereas platelet TXB2 generation was almost completely inhibited in all of the patients and healthy volunteers. OKY-046 had a slight inhibitory effect on collagen induced aggregation. A combination of OKY-046 with a very low dose of aspirin, on the other hand, produced additional inhibition of the platelet aggregation induced by both AA and collagen. The present results suggest that the accumulation and metabolism of cyclooxygenase products that accumulate when TX synthetase is blocked, differ in each subject, additional inhibition is caused by the combined use of TX synthetase inhibitor and a very low dose of aspirin because the very low dose of aspirin partially reduces the proaggregatory cyclooxygenase products that accumulate when TX synthetase is blocked.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC4085576": "Measurements were made of the spectral transmissivity of freshly isolated normal human crystalline lenses.

ApoB mRNA editing is developmentally regulated in human fetal small intestine, producing parallel changes in the synthesis and secretion of apoB100 and apoB48. Neither fetal nor adult liver contained detectable levels (less than 1%) of edited apoB mRNA. By contrast, apoB mRNA is incrementally edited during development in several extraintestinal fetal tissues. These tissues demonstrated significant differences, however, in both the extent and developmental profile of apoB mRNA editing. Additionally, while apoB100 synthesis and secretion was demonstrated in these tissues, apoB48 synthesis was confined to the small intestine. Thus, although the molecular mechanism underlying this process remains unclear, the capacity to edit apoB mRNA is widely distributed among both fetal and adult tissues. We speculate that the asynchronous and developmentally modulated induction of apoB mRNA editing may provide a novel mechanism for regulating lipoprotein biogenesis in both the developing fetus and adult human.", "PMC3936755": "Cystozoites of Sarcocystis sp. isolated from beef muscles were purified by elution through Spheron chromatographic gel.

The optimum purity was achieved at the elution rate of 10 ml/min and column length of 100 mm. The recovery of cystozoites (38-56%) was in correlation to the ionic strength of the eluent.

In the present study in Roux-en-Y rats with gastric fistula, perfusion of the loop with hyperosmolal (1200 mOsm X kg-1 of PEG solution) 0.20 M HCl produced a greater reduction of the maximal response to pentagastrin (91% inhibition) than perfusion with 0.20 M HCl (64%), suggesting that HCl and hyperosmolal solution inhibit secretion by different mechanisms. The maximal acid response to histamine was more resistant to inhibition than that to pentagastrin; 0.20 M HCl inhibited secretion by 43%, 1200 mOsm X kg-1 of PEG solution by 42%, and hyperosmolal 0.20 M HCl by 60%.

BBMV alkaline phosphatase activity gave linear ln(activity) vs. radiation dose plots with a target size of 68 +/- 3 kDa, similar to previously reported values. Water and solute transport were measured using the stopped-flow light-scattering technique. The rates of acetamide and osmotic water transport did not depend on radiation dose (0-7 Mrad), suggesting that transport of these substances does not require a protein carrier. In contrast, urea and thiourea transport gave linear ln(activity) vs. dose curves with a target size of 125-150 kDa; 400 mM urea inhibited thiourea flux by -50% at 0 and 4.7 Mrad, showing that radiation does not affect inhibitor binding to surviving transporters.

Multiparous patients with eclampsia were different on long-term follow-up from primiparous eclamptic women. A logical conclusion from this observation is that multiparous and primiparous patient groups should be analyzed separately whenever hypertensive diseases of pregnancy are evaluated. This study is therefore an attempt to define the clinical profile of hypertension during pregnancy on the basis of parity alone. The prenatal and hospital records of 99 successive pregnant patients identified as hypertensive during a 1-year period at Mount Sinai Hospital Medical Center served as the study population. A group of 25 primiparous and 25 multiparous patients, all with uncomplicated pregnancies and normal deliveries in sequence during a 1-month period, served as normal nonhypertensive control groups. Various pregnancy parameters were statistically evaluated for study and control groups. Significant differences were found between hypertensive primiparous and multiparous patients in mean weight increase (p less than 0.05), gestational age at first increase in blood pressure (p less than 0.007), and time from first increase in blood pressure until delivery (p less than 0.008). The difference in birth weight was not significant between hypertensive groups. In contrast, among the control groups, multiparous patients had significantly larger offspring than primiparous patients (p less than 0.01). Weights of normal primiparous control women were almost identical to those of primiparous hypertensive women (3252.8 +/- 511.8 versus 3203.26 +/- 679.5 gm).

No significant differences in a variety of laboratory findings, reflexes, edema, or mode of delivery were observed between the various groups. The clinical and laboratory presentation of hypertension in pregnancy may be similar between primiparous and multiparous patients.

This method identifies proliferating cells by binding the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 to a nuclear antigen present in all cells that are in the G1, S, G2, and M phase of the cell cycle, but not in the G0 phase. In a kinetic study of Na cell line U937 using concanavalin A for stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a steady increase of Ki-67 positive cells evaluated by flow cytometry was observed. Simultaneously, the [3H]thymidine uptake of the ConA blasts was measured and compared to the expression of Ki-67. A linear correlation between the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells and the log transformed counts per minute was demonstrated, and staining with Ki-67 detected cell proliferation with the same sensitivity as 3H-TdR uptake. In addition, it was possible to stain Ki-67-labelled cells with a second cell marker if a second fluorescent dye coupled to an antibody was used. This provided the opportunity to define precisely the phenotype of proliferating cells.

Moreover, adult neurones may respond in a different manner from developing neurones to the same environmental cues. Thus, the recovery of the integrative and transmission capabilities (which depend on the neuronal architecture, passive and active membrane properties, and synaptic receptor distribution) by a regenerating adult neurone may not be complete. In the present review, we examine several aspects of the outcome of the interaction between the microenvironment and regrowing neurones using the cockroach giant interneurones (GINs) as a model system. We demonstrate that whereas extrinsic cues govern the morphological redifferentiation and distribution of synaptic receptors, the distribution of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels is to a large extent determined by intrinsic factors. The pathway of regrowth and the architecture of regenerating GINs were studied by examination of intracellularly stained fibres. The environments provided by the connectives and ganglia are different. The elongating sprouts in the connective appeared as smooth cylinders. Within the ganglionic domain, the main longitudinal sprouts emitted neurites which extended and branched into the neuropile. The local cues for branching of neurites were eliminated by freezing and thawing of the ganglia prior to the arrival of the growing tips. The failure to extend neurites under these conditions is attributed to the elimination of extrinsic signals for morphological redifferentiation of the fibres, since the same fibres emit neurites in anterior ganglia which have not been subjected to freezing and thawing. The distribution of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the GINs was mapped by ionophoretic application of ACh. In both the intact and regenerating GINs receptors were located only on the neurites. Freezing and thawing of a ganglion eliminated the local signals for insertion and/or activation of AChRs on the neurites. Thus, both the morphological redifferentiation and the distribution of AChRs are affected by the microenvironment. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels were detected after intracellular injection of tetraethylammonium into the GIN and in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and Ba2+ in the extracellular space. The regrowing axon tips always revealed large barium action potentials independent of the CNS microenvironment. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that Ca2+ plays an important role in the growth process. However, increased Ba2+ responsiveness was also observed in axonal segments proximal to the region of neuronal extension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC3965016": "In a longitudinal study of a sample of firemen in London 1006 firemen were interviewed and examined in 1976 and 895 were seen a second time 12 months later.

The average levels of FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC in both years compared favourably with conventional predicted values. Separate multiple regression analysis for the two years indicated that the FEV1 and FVC fell more rapidly in those aged over 40, and that cigarette smoking had a strong harmful effect on these measures of function. Only among men with over 20 years' service was there possibly any evidence (not statistically significant) of an effect from duration of employment.

Reflectance spectra of tissue hemoglobin at the brain's surface were measured for assessment of both local tissue hemoglobin content and its oxygen saturation. Local oxygen consumption was calculated from the spectral changes of tissue hemoglobin during complete cessation of blood flow by compression of the cortical surface in the suprasylvian gyrus with the tip of an optic probe. This procedure was performed without any brain damage and only took approximately 5 s. The calculated local oxygen consumption during this short period of compression remained constant for a few seconds. Then, it decreased rapidly, although the local tissue hemoglobin was not completely deoxygenated. The value of local cerebral oxygen consumption obtained by this method was 3.02 +/- 0.61 mL O2/100 g brain/min; it was not influenced by the change in systemic blood pressure. The effect of pentobarbital on cerebral oxygen consumption was also studied.

When the cells were grown on glucose, tyramine failed to derepress the arylsulfatase synthesis. When grown with methionine as the sole sulfur source, the enzyme was synthesized irrespective of the carbon source used. Addition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate overcame the catabolite repression of synthesis of the derepressed enzyme caused by tyramine. Uptake of tyramine was not affected by the carbon source. We isolated a mutant strain in which derepression of arylsulfatase synthesis by tyramine occurred even in the presence of glucose and inorganic sulfate. This strain also produced beta-galactosidase in the presence of an inducer and glucose.

Hypertension (blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) was found in 20% of 101 consecutive patients with UHY. Twenty-six patients with UHY and hypertension were followed for 35 months and the effect of surgery on blood pressure was analyzed. Blood pressure fell from 178 +/- 4/108 +/- 4 to 135 +/- 2/84 +/- 2 mm Hg after surgery. Hypertension was cured in 62%, improved in 19% and unchanged in 19%. In 73% of the cured patients the PRA-ratio was greater than or equal to 1.5, while all unchanged patients had a value of less than 1.5. Hypertensive patients were significantly older than normotensive patients, but did not differ in kidney function, underlying cause of hydronephrosis, incidence of urinary tract infection or frequency of interstitial nephritis. We conclude that in UHY the incidence of hypertension is not particularly high. However, in a substantial number of patients, high blood pressure is reversible by surgery. In most of these patients the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system seems to play an important role in sustaining high blood pressure, although in some patients other mechanisms might be operative as well.

All men were treated with 49 g per week of either Betamethasone Diproprionate in an optimized vehicle or Clobetasol Proprionate ointment. Three methods used to assess HPAS were compared. Classic 8 a.m. plasma cortisol measurements, urinary-free cortisol, and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid determinations and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GCMS) quantitation of urinary cortisol metabolites were compared. Values for all methods were obtained just prior to therapy and at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 during therapy and at day 28 after treatment was stopped for 7 d. Plasma cortisol measurements correlated well with other measures of HPAS. GCMS determination of urinary cortisol metabolites was slightly more sensitive at detecting HPAS than the other two methods. Persistent HPAS after day 7 was only appreciated by GCMS. Urinary-free cortisol and 17-hydroxycortisol was the least sensitive of the three methods. Analysis of urinary cortisol metabolites by GCMS may be most useful in the monitoring of HPAS resulting from use of topical glucocorticosteroid preparations.", "PMC2952246": "Although no frequently described in the podiatric literature, nuclear medicine imaging may be of great assistance to the clinical podiatrist.

Na+ serves as an allosteric modulator for leucine transport, lowering the Km for leucine from 66 to 15 microM. C. vinosum cells also contain a system that transports both isoleucine and valine. The isoleucine/valine system has the attributes of a H+/amino acid symport at pH less than 7.5 but appears to function as a H+/Na+ (Li+)/amino acid symport at pH greater than or equal to 7.5. Na+ gradients produce an allosteric lowering of the Km values for both isoleucine and valine, from 14 to 7 microM and from 34 to 17 microM, respectively. C. vinosum also accumulates D-alanine in an energy-dependent reaction. The transport process appears to involve the electrogenic cotransport of D-alanine and Na+. The Km value for D-alanine was determined to be 9 microM. Unlike the previously characterized C. vinosum L-alanine/Na+ symport, Na+ gradients did not affect the Km for D-alanine transport. L-Alanine and glycine, but not alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, act as competitive inhibitors for D-alanine transport.", "PMC3069013": "Six monoclonal antibodies and ten alloantisera were used to precipitate cell surface molecules of approximately 44 kDa (class I MHC antigens) from radiolabelled equine peripheral blood lymphocytes. All ten antisera were raised against antigens of a single donor horse (horse 0834, ELA-A2,-A2). Four methods of producing antisera were compared: one or two pregnancies, skin allografting, and skin grafting followed by pregnancy. Immunization by pregnancy appeared to produce antibodies against class I products only, while skin grafting raised antibodies to class II antigens as well. Nine of the antisera were raised across an entire MHC haplotype barrier, while one recipient carried the ELA-A2 antigen of the donor. The pregnancy antiserum raised across this barrier probably identifies a second polymorphic class I locus in the horse. Sequential immunoprecipitation using this antiserum in the first stage and an anti-MHC haplotype antiserum or monoclonal antibody reagent in the second stage supported this hypothesis. Gene products of this second ELA class I locus are immunogenic in pregnancy.", "PMC3069011": "A cell surface molecule of equine T lymphocytes was identified and characterized using a mouse monoclonal antibody, HT23A.

HT23A labelled T cell areas of horse lymph nodes and spleen when used in an indirect immunoperoxidase assay on frozen sections.

By applying pulse polarography at the dropping mercury electrode to acetonitrile extracts of animal tissues and eggs, a detection limit of 50 micrograms/kg and mean recoveries of 79% were obtained. The same extracts were used for the HPLC determination with electrochemical detection. This led to a detection limit of 1 microgram/kg. Additional rapid confirmation can be obtained from HPLC using an internal standard (nifursol) and comparing peak area proportions of both substances at varied polarization voltages.

The mean IgG1:IgG2 ratio of naturally infected cattle was 1:4 indicating a significant (p less than 0.001) IgG2 dominance. Similar ratios were detected in the experimentally infected cattle. The dominance of IgG2 was independent of breed, sex, and age. Twenty-nine cattle had significant immunoglobulin levels to both C. psittaci and Coxiella (C.) burnetii simultaneously. The predominance of C. psittaci-specific IgG2, in contrast to the predominance of C. burnetti-specific IgG1 detected in these same individual serum samples under identical conditions, indicates that the ability to preferentially produce either IgG1 or IgG2 was not limited in these individual cattle. A transient yet significant IgG1 response was also developed in cows following chlamydia-induced abortions (immunotype 1) or in cattle infected with the polyarthritis-serositis-encephalomyelitis agents (immunotype 2). IgG1 levels decreased faster than IgG2 levels. These findings have diagnostic implications and identify the need for determining the immunoglobulin classes and subclasses of the humoral immune responses of animals and man to chlamydial infections.", "PMC3756919": "Mucins derived from colonic cancers differ immunologically and chemically from those in normal colonic epithelium. It has been demonstrated that the lectin from the peanut will bind to mucins present in colonic cancers and other neoplastic lesions but not to those from the normal colon. It was hypothesized, therefore, that in transformed colonic epithelium the glycosylation of mucins occurs differently than in normal epithelium. To rule out the possibility that the differences in oligosaccharide structure were due to postsecretory degradation, studies were designed to evaluate cancer-associated colonic mucins produced under more controlled conditions. We studied nine different cancer cell lines first in monolayer culture and then as xenografts in athymic or nude mice. Eight of the nine cell lines in monolayer culture synthesized glycoconjugates that were labeled by fluorescein-conjugated lectins. After injection into nude mice, eight of the nine cell lines produced tumors typical of human colonic cancer, and six of nine secreted mucin. The mucins produced by the xenografts were labeled at fluorescence microscopy by peanut lectin and other lectins, characteristic of what had been seen in other primary human colonic cancers. One cell line, LS174T, produced large amounts of mucin in the xenograft model. Mucin was purified from these tumors and characterized biochemically. It was demonstrated that mucin purified from the xenografts bound peanut lectin. Therefore, we have concluded that cancer-associated mucins are present in cultured colorectal tumor cells. The cancer-associated mucins are also found in nude mouse xenografts, indicating that they are not the result of postsecretory degradation by colonic flora or by tumor cell necrosis. The cell culture and xenograft can therefore be useful for studying the biosynthesis of cancer-associated mucins.", "PMC3601584": "Haemolytic activities of the classical and alternative complement pathways, and levels of C1, C4, C3, factor B and C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) were measured in 137 serum samples of 69 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In most sera IgG, IgA and IgM concentrations were determined as well. Clinical correlations of these laboratory parameters have been studied. C1 and C4 activities were found to be depressed in almost 50% of the sera tested, and hypogammaglobulinaemia was observed with a similar frequency. Low C1 and C4 levels were found mainly in the early stages of the disease. A strong association between the occurrence of infections and hypogammaglobulinaemia was observed, although low immunoglobulin levels frequently occurred in patients without a history of infections. Low C1 and C4 levels were significantly correlated with the incidence of infections, too, and this correlation was observed mostly in the early stages of the disease. The reason for this is not known. The present results suggest that not only low immunoglobulin levels but low C1 and/or C4 levels may contribute to the increased susceptibility to infections in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.", "PMC1382248": "The once-daily alpha 1 blocker terazosin was administered to 36 men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who had previously been scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). At 3 months, terazosin at 5 mg q.d. produced improvements in symptom scores, peak urinary flow rates, mean urinary flow rates, and residual urine. These improvements were maintained at 6 and 9 months. Terazosin also proved to be well tolerated, with no cases of hypotension or erectile dysfunction. We conclude that terazosin is effective in relieving obstructive urinary symptoms of BPH and that it allows many patients to be placed in a \"holding pattern,\" allowing surgery to be delayed until the disease progresses. The use of terazosin also increased the capabilities of our urologic clinic. By reducing the urgency of surgery, it allowed us to schedule TURPs more conveniently and thereby accommodate more prostate surgery within the limited resources of our clinic.

The difference between the 2 groups underlines the presence of emotional stress. Lidocaine without and with a vasoconstrictor changes the heart rate and blood pressure differently. These haemodynamic changes are superposed by alterations caused by emotional stress and are similar in all test series. The so-called epinephrine-collapse often seems to have its cause in an abrupt relative deficiency of epinephrine after stress.

In the present article the nonpyramidal cell population of this cortex is considered. It is known from Golgi preparations that in layers II-VIa there are bipolar cells, smooth or sparsely spinous multipolar and bitufted cells with either unmyelinated local plexus or myelinated axons, and chandelier cells. Each of these cell types has been previously examined in Golgi-electron microscopic preparations. The question now being asked is whether the information about the characteristics of these different types of nonpyramidal cells derived from the Golgi-electron microscopic studies can be used to identify the cell bodies of nonpyramidal cells in tissue prepared for conventional electron microscopy. If this can be done then the neuronal composition of area 17 can be determined. It has been found that the cell bodies of bipolar cells can be readily identified because they are elongate and have nuclei with a vertical infolding and few axosomatic synapses, which are of both the symmetric and asymmetric varieties. Evidence is presented to show that there are two types of bipolar cells, small ones and large ones, the large ones being distinguished by their well-developed endoplasmic reticulum in which the cisternae are arranged parallel to the cell surface. Bipolar cells account for 6% of the neuronal profiles in layer II/III, 3% in layer IV, 5% in layer V, and 2% in layer VIa. The cell bodies of other types of nonpyramidal cells in layers II-VIa cannot be distinguished from each other in thin sections, because recognition of the different cell types depends upon the characteristics and distribution of their dendrites and axons. However, it is evident that in this group of neurons there are some with small cell bodies and others with large cell bodies, and in both size groups there are varieties of neurons which can be recognized from the characteristics of their perikaryal cytoplasm. All of these neurons have both symmetric and asymmetric axosomatic synapses. The greatest number of these nonpyramidal cells which are not bipolar in form is found within layer II/III, where they account for 7% of all neuronal profiles. These neurons comprise 4% of all neuronal profiles in layer IV, 6% in layer V, and 2% in layer VIa. Layers I and VIb contain only nonpyramidal cells, but these are different from the ones in layers II-VIa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC2927602": "Serious morbidity and hyperemic states continue to complicate the treatment of certain intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinical and radiographic characteristics of 62 patients treated over 3 years were analyzed to determine if hyperemic complications (HCs) (defined as unusual perioperative edema or hemorrhage) and outcome could be predicted. Twenty-five (40%) of the patients were less than 30 years old, 28 (45%) were between 30 and 50, and 9 (15%) were more than 50. A history of hemorrhage was found in 48%, and 34% presented with progressive deficits. Thirteen (21%) developed evidence of HCs; 51 (82%) ultimately had a good outcome, 4 (6%) had a poor outcome, and 7 (11%) died. The incidence of HCs was higher in patients whose AVMs recruited perforating vessels (53%) than those without (7%) (P less than 0.001). The presence of preoperative angiographic steal carried a 35% risk of HCs whereas its absence carried a 13% risk (P less than 0.05). The sum of the diameters of the feeding vessels was also predictive (P less than 0.05). Outcome was clearly age-related: good outcome was achieved in 92% of the patients less than 30 years old, 86% of those 30 to 50, and 44% of patients older than 50 (P less than 0.05). Left hemispheric AVMs showed less morbidity than right (P less than 0.05) as did those without perforating vessel recruitment (P less than 0.07).

However, subunit 1 (and therefore transferases 1-1 and 1-2) was not detected. The most conspicuous difference is the presence in lung of a new form, eluting at pH 8.7, which is not detected in rat liver. This isoenzyme (transferase \"pH 8.7\") is characterized by its low apparent subunit Mr and high efficiency in the conjugation of glutathione with anti-benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, considered the ultimate carcinogen of benzo(a)-pyrene.", "PMC3074335": "The relationships between transient cerebral and retinal ischemic symptoms and brachiocephalic angiographic findings were studied in 464 patients.

Keratin polypeptides of normal pouch epithelium appear in a molecular weight range of 43-67 kd and 5-6 proteins can be identified. The disappearance of high molecular weight keratin (61-67 kd) was observed from the 6-wk DMBA-treated premalignant group to the 15-wk DMBA-treated malignant group.

We have re-introduced clones of two of these genes, myo-3 and unc-54 at low copy number into the germline of C. elegans. The resulting loci behave as functional copies of the genes by two genetic criteria: (i) they can result in phenotypic rescue of strains carrying inactivating myo-3 or unc-54 mutations, and (ii) their presence in strains with wild-type copies of the endogenous myosin loci has genetic consequences similar to duplicating the endogenous loci. The re-introduced genes function at a level close to that of the endogenous loci. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the different isoforms have been used to localize the expressed proteins. The re-introduced genes express in precisely the same cell types as the endogenous genes, and the myosin products produced assemble into filament structures as in wild-type. Unexpectedly, we have found in the course of this work that very high copy numbers of the unc-54 gene lead to a disruption of muscle structure which may result from overexpression of the protein product.", "PMC2196875": "We have studied the activity of yeast PGK promoter in E. coli at different temperatures using lacZ as the reporter gene.

Northern blot analysis showed that the level of lacZ transcript was less in recombinant cells grown at 42 degrees C, whereas plasmid copy number per cell was more as compared to recombinant cells grown at 30 degrees C. Data suggest that the yeast PGK promoter is less active at 42 degrees C and that this activity is regulated at the level of transcription.", "PMC2822703": "Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated diadenosine tetraphosphate was found to inhibit the in vitro replication of SV40 DNA. This inhibition was sensitive to preincubation of the polymer with either poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A):ADP phosphohydrolase, or an excess of free Ap4A. In contrast, the general catalytic activity of DNA polymerase was not inhibited by the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Ap4A when activated salmon sperm DNA was used as a template. These data suggest that inhibition of SV40 DNA replication by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Ap4A requires both the intact polymer and intact Ap4A moiety and is specific to events occurring during the initiation or elongation of a double-stranded template. Since both poly(ADP-ribose) and Ap4A accumulate in cultured mammalian cells following stresses which are accompanied by DNA strand breaks, these data are consistent with a model in which poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Ap4A inhibits DNA replication following DNA damage.", "PMC116438": "The Bacillus cereus protein has been obtained from culture fluid in homogenic form as indicated by SDS-disc electrophoresis and immunodiffusion not described before.

Nonetheless, casual pressures remain the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertensive patients. We compared casual and noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in a consecutive series of 60 subjects evaluated for possible mild hypertension on the basis of casual pressures. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed on days of usual activity. Correlations between casual systolic and average ambulatory systolic pressures or casual diastolic and average ambulatory diastolic pressures were not significant. Nearly half of the subjects had average ambulatory systolic pressures less than 130 mm Hg. Sixty percent had average ambulatory diastolic pressures less than 85 mm Hg. Nearly 40% had both systolic and diastolic pressures less than those limits. A preliminary analysis of the effects of these results on the short-term cost of antihypertensive treatment was made, assuming that treatment could be withheld from those with average ambulatory pressures less than 130/85 mm Hg. This approach suggests that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring need not increase overall cost, if the results of this evaluation are used in the decision to treat.", "PMC2148185": "This study investigated the interaction between the polyamines spermine and spermidine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by using (+)-[3H]-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-im ine maleate ([3H]MK801) binding to well washed rat brain membranes. The actions of arcaine, agmatine, diethylenetriamine and 1,8-octanediamine as polyamine antagonists were compared to use as tools in this study. Arcaine was found to be the antagonist of choice due to its greater potency. Several divalent cations, including Ba++, Ca++ and Sr++, but not Zn++, decreased the apparent potency of arcaine. These cations enhance [3H]MK801 binding in a similar fashion to spermidine and spermine suggesting that they may share a common site and mechanism of action. Moreover, arcaine competitively reduced the enhancement of [3H]MK801 binding produced by Sr++ did not alter the inhibition produced by higher concentrations of this cation, a phenomenon that also occurs with spermidine. The distinct arcaine sensitivity of the two separate phases of the concentration-response curves of both spermidine and Sr++ suggests two separate mechanisms underlying the action of spermidine-like drugs on the NMDA receptor. Further investigation of the increase in [3H]MK801 binding produced by spermidine revealed that spermidine increased the equilibrium affinity of this ligand by 2-fold without significantly altering the density of binding sites. In contrast, polyamine induced increases in the dissociation of [3H]MK801 required higher polyamine concentrations than necessary to increase ligand binding and were relatively insensitive to arcaine. These findings suggest that polyamines do not activate or promote the activation of the NMDA receptor, but instead enhance [3H]MK801 binding by allosterically increasing ligand affinity.", "PMC4629651": "A transduction analysis of phenylalanine-responding mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed the existence of six unlinked genes.

The physiology of catecholamines as well as their measuring indications are discussed, together with concise evaluation of the methods most commonly used, namely indirect radioenzymatic assays or direct determinations by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with either electrochemical or fluorometric detection. The main advantage of radioenzymatic assay is its sensitivity and thus the need for only a small sample. Liquid chromatographic methods in general are less tedious, relatively rapid, and cheap, and omit the use of radionuclides. Both of these methods, however, are subject to a number of analytical errors, which can only be avoided by proper development of methods and skilled use of these methods.

Immunoassay data and localization studies both indicate that the lectin is particularly associated with late embryonic and early postnatal development. No lectin could be detected in embryos prior to 21 days of gestation, whereas many tissues showed an increase in lectin around the time of birth. It is likely that in most tissues the high concentrations of lectin are largely due to increased synthesis by fibroblasts, which are particularly abundant and active in connective tissue during the extensive tissue reorganization taking place at this time. The lectin appears to be synthesized by other differentiated cell types also, notably myoblasts, alveolar cells and erythroblasts. The peak of lectin concentration seen in foetal liver probably reflects lectin associated with foetal erythropoiesis. The rabbit lectin has a low specific activity but its tissue concentration is correspondingly higher than lectin concentrations in other mammals. This conservation of total lectin activity suggests a fundamental role for the lectin dependent upon its saccharide binding activity. This and other indirect evidence suggests that these lectins are involved in the synthesis, secretion or organization of extracellular matrix components.", "PMC3760800": "Silent thyroiditis is an increasingly recognized cause of transient thyrotoxicosis.

The thyrotoxic state spontaneously resolves in 2 to 12 weeks at which time the patient either returns to a euthyroid state or passes through a transient hypothyroid phase. Diagnostic laboratory findings include elevations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine and a markedly depressed radioactive iodine uptake.

Below 0.3 M NaCl the overall structure of the molecule is disc-shaped; at 0 M NaCl the axial ratio of the disc is about 1:7 and between 0.1 M to 0.3 M it is slightly more asymmetric, with an axial ratio of 1:10. At about 0.3 M NaCl there is a reversible transition to a more open structure, and, from 0.3 M up to 1.1 M NaCl the small-angle X-ray data can be explained by models consisting of ensembles of flexible, non-overlapping, bead-chains generated by a Monte Carlo procedure. Within this concentration range there is a gradual increase in the stiffness of the chains, as well as a decrease in bead radius, which indicates that the molecule becomes more open when the NaCl concentration is increased. The transition to a more open structure is also demonstrated by the average radius of gyration which increases gradually from 8.26 nm at 0 M NaCl to 8.75 nm at physiological or near-physiological conditions, and up to 16.2 nm at 1.1 M NaCl.", "PMC2199213": "Proteins were solubilized selectively from chlorosomes of Chloroflexus aurantiacus by electrophoretic gel filtration according to Griebenow et al.

However, the ratio VImax/VEmax was related to the IR'/ER' ratio only. The subject's perception of combined loads differing both in intensity and IR/ER ratio could be well depicted by the equivalent resistive-load-sensation contours.

Younger patients generally presented with less severe initial contractures and had the greatest percentage of improvement. When used on a single limb when bilateral contractures were present, sympathetic reduction of the contracture occurred to varying degrees in the unsplinted limb.

We dissected ACI (RT1a) rat corneas into separate epithelial, stromal, and endothelial components by a method that yields pure cell populations in tissue culture, and grafted these components separately to groups of fully allogeneic PVG (RT1c) recipients). Grafts of corneal stroma elicited strong cellular cytotoxic immune responses in a cell-mediated lymphocytotoxic assay, but corneal epithelium failed to generate any detectable response. Grafts of corneal endothelium alone, however, evoked a potent cellular cytotoxic response. Using congenic rats, it was found that grafts from PVG.1A (RT1a) donors to PVG (RT1c) recipients (which differ at both the RT1.A and B loci) yielded identical results. However, no corneal component graft from PVG.R1 (RT1rl) donors to PVG recipients (which differ only at RT1.A) generated a detectable immune response. Use of target lymphoblasts from congenic strains established that at least part of all responses detected were directed against class I (RT1.A) major histocompatibility complex antigens. These findings indicate that there is differential immunogenicity of specific corneal tissue components in the rat that may be further influenced by the degree of MHC disparity between donor and recipient.", "PMC3973705": "A simple method is described for checking the patency of ventriculoperitoneal shunts by using a pair of small disc thermistors. With this technique, shunt patency is shown by a downward deflection of the recording trace, blockage of the ventricular catheter is indicated by a flat-line recording, and obstruction of the distal end of the abdominal catheter is demonstrated by an upward deflection. These observations were confirmed in a study of 32 hydrocephalic patients with obstructed shunts who subsequently underwent shuntography and operation. An experimental model was also devised to study the mechanism of the recording changes.", "PMC2873823": "In this study, 142 patients under 12 years of age with the diagnosis of urticaria accompanied or not by angioedema were examined. In all 72.6% of the patients were under 6 years of age. Boys and girls were equally affected, 13.4% of the cases had chronic urticaria, 56.3% had a previous history of urticaria, 88.0% had generalized urticaria, and about half of the cases had associated angioedema. The causes of the urticaria were identified or suspected in 32.4% of the cases. Drugs, foods, insect bites and stings, infections and cold were the most common or associated precipitating agents in that order. Histories revealed 27.5% of the cases had records of other allergic diseases, and 76.1% had allergic diseases in the family. Dermographisms were found in 16.2% of the cases, and 22.5% of cases had eosinophilia. The means of IgE levels in both acute and chronic urticaria were within normal limits, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Skin testing was of little practical value in evaluating the etiology of the urticaria. Clinical trials of drugs for symptomatic treatment revealed that clemastine, ketotifen and hydroxyzine gave approximately equally high response rates. All these three medications gave significantly greater response rates than chlorpheniramine.", "PMC3738495": "Risk management, for the control of toxic chemicals in particular, and risky human activity in general, begins with the perception of risk and the identification of hazards. The machinery of quantification and evaluation of risk proceeds in a climate of risk perception, and is affected by the state of such perception among all participants in the process. The management of risk, either through legislation or corporate decision making, although ideally objective, is frequently governed by subjective considerations, especially when those individuals or bodies responsible for management decisions develop a 'local' perception of risk. The details of decision making and the sensitivity of the process to various sources of information is reviewed with emphasis on the control of toxic chemicals.", "PMC3169399": "The behavior of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) is affected by external stimuli.

The large cellular aggregates are initially solid but subsequently cavitate to form hollow, thin-walled vesicles. These cells also contain an endogenous beta-D-galactoside-binding lectin. Previous work has shown that high extracellular concentrations of this lectin are associated with decreased cell-cell adhesion [Milos, N. and S.E. Zalik: Differentiation 21, 175-182 (1982)]. We have removed the fluid contents from aggregates cultured for 24 and 48 h and tested them for the presence of lectin activity. The results demonstrate that lectin activity is detectable in a higher number of aggregates cultured for 24 as opposed to 48 h (75% vs. 28%, respectively). The lectin activity per aggregate is also higher in aggregates cultured for 24 h (180 vs. 67 hemagglutinating units, respectively, for 24- and 48-h aggregates). Thus, at the time when cells are moving apart from one another during aggregate cavitation, detectable lectin activity is released into the vesicular contents of the aggregate.", "PMC4091050": "This study presents a case of beta-blocker intoxication due to massive overdose of metoprolol (7.5 g).

It is suggested that the individual differences in the responses of patients to cardiac glycosides, a great range of doses of the drugs causing intoxication as well as the absence of a close correlation between the occurrence of therapeutic and toxic effects and blood plasma glycoside concentration are related to the change of the level of endogenous digitalis-like substances in the organism.

On the other hand, a maximal increase of liver phosphorylase a was found after 5 min and this response was attenuated at 10 and 20 minutes in the fed rats. Fasting for 24 h extinguished the greatest part of this response. During infusion, a decrease of liver synthase a activity was observed in the fasted and of total synthase activity in both the fed and fasted animals. In fed rats an i.v. bolus of 0.50 microgram.kg-1 or doubling of the infusion rate for 5 min, both immediately after 20 min of infusion, led to maximal phosphorylase a activity again and to a decrease of synthase a activity.

Illness was associated with a marked increase in the concentration of serum proteins in the secretions, and during inflammation there was no apparent barrier to the passage of large molecules (molecular weight 775,000) from the serum into the respiratory passages. At the time of virus isolation, trainees requiring hospitalization had less immunoglobulin A (IgA) in their secretions even though they had greater quantities of immunoglobin G (P < 0.05) and albumin than trainees followed in the field, whose secretions were also tested at the time of virus isolation. Base-line IgA and protein concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) in hospitalized trainees than in trainees followed prospectively in the field. The results suggest a nonspecific protective function for secretion protein, although we have not excluded the possibility that field study trainees were protected by specific neutralizing antibody present in the nasal secretion.", "PMC2614494": "Five patients (aged 19-52 years) were treated for a midbrain syndrome due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning and had clinical follow-up investigations for up to 18 months. Three patients recovered with minor neurological and neuro-psychological deficits and resumed their premorbid life-style. One patient had normal findings, while the fifth remained in a permanent vegetative state. Initial CT of the brain may fail to detect low-density lesions in the globus pallidus. If present, these lesions may either have disappeared, diminished, or remained unchanged at follow-up. Long-term outcome seems to show a closer link to white matter changes, which are at present best investigated by magnetic resonance imaging.

We now show that a second lectin, present in tsetse haemolymph, is essential to complete the maturation process. Interactions between tsetse lectins and parasite surface coats probably determine trypanosome transmissibility and may be partly responsible for the distribution of trypanosomiasis in Africa.", "PMC3001053": "The chromatin structure of the 3'-nontranscribed spacer of the linear rRNA gene molecules of Tetrahymena thermophila was examined.

E., and Blackburn, E. H. (1985) Nucleic Acids Res. 13, 2661-2680], and the terminus of the molecule. Using sensitivity to nucleases as a probe, a unique chromatin structure was found in this rDNA region. Proceeding from the end of the rDNA molecule, the telomeric repeated sequence, (CCCCAA)n, was packaged in a non-nucleosomal complex adjacent to three phased nucleosomes. This nucleosomal structure was disrupted at the Type V repeat region, which, compared with the neighboring nucleosomal region, was more accessible to nucleases and, from both micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion results, was packaged in chromatin differently from the sequences flanking it on both sides. The region between the Type V repeats and adjacent to the transcription termination site was in yet another distinguishable chromatin structure as judged by its sensitivity to nucleases. It includes sites protected in chromatin and sites which were cleaved in chromatin but not detectably digested in DNA controls, suggesting that specific proteins are also associated with this region.", "PMC3905849": "A production model of the autoSCAN-4 system (American MicroScan, Inc., Mahwah, N.J.) was tested with not more than 11 strains each of 73 groups or species of gram-negative bacilli from various Centers for Disease Control culture collections.

The autoSCAN-4 system identified 95.3% of all 405 cultures accurately: 95.4% of 307 members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 96.6% of 29 nonenteric fermenters, and 94.2% of 69 nonfermenters. Manual readings of the same trays provided essentially the same results, with a maximum change of only +1.6% identification accuracy of members of the Enterobacteriaceae. These data were obtained by all required additional tests, including serology and computer consultation when indicated. Only 19 of the cultures tested were misidentified. These were distributed randomly throughout the various groups and species except that Edwardsiella tarda was usually missed because of poor H2S reactions in the test medium.

Twelve patients, who required major blood replacement during elective surgery, were studied to determine the changes in coagulation when packed red cells were used to replace major blood loss. In addition, the coagulation abnormalities present at the time an observer noted excessive bleeding were determined. Prior to blood product replacement and after the estimated loss of each 0.3 blood volume, coagulation tests were obtained including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen levels, and assays of coagulation Factors V, VIII, and IX. Coagulation tests were repeated when clinical hemostasis was judged inadequate by the anesthesiologist and attending surgeon. Significant decreases in platelet count, fibrinogen levels, and Factor V, VIII, and IX levels occurred as increasing blood volumes were replaced. Increases in PT and aPTT above control occurred in nine of the 12 patients prior to replacement of 1 blood volume; none of the nine patients had increased clinical bleeding. In four of seven patients who had blood replacement of greater than 1 blood volume, increased clinical bleeding was noted by the observer. Platelet counts were less than 100,000/mm3 in each of these four patients, and a platelet concentrate obtained by pheresis of a single donor was administered. In two of the four patients platelet counts increased, but clinical bleeding did not resolve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3198449": "Psychoanalytic medicine can incorporate information from the neurosciences to expand anatomic characterology through new knowledge of brain function.

This ability, which may be in the direction of human brain evolution, contributes to personality development in a way that is not conflicted but leads to investments of mental abilities with intense interest. Personality traits may result that are misunderstood and unpopular despite the crucial need for such persons at this point in our society's history.

In this paper, the nature of this phenomenon is studied and the bound manganese is used as a reporter group to monitor a redox-linked conformational change in the protein. A reductive titration of the cyanide-inhibited enzyme shows that the change in the manganese EPR signal is associated with reduction of CuA. The change appears to reflect a rearrangement in the rhombic octahedral coordination environment of the central Mn2+ atom and is indicative of a redox-linked conformational transition in the enzyme. The manganese is likely to reside at the interface of subunits I and II, near the periplasmic side of the membrane. One of its ligands may be provided by the transmembrane segment X of subunit I, which has been suggested to contribute ligands to cytochrome a and CuB as well. Another manganese ligand is a water oxygen, as indicated by broadening of the manganese EPR signal in the presence of H2(17)O.", "PMC3310203": "SEM studies related to carious change in dental enamel are reviewed, and their contribution to understanding the mechanism of formation of the early enamel lesion and of its repair evaluated. SEM has contributed significantly to understanding the mechanism of enamel dissolution at the level of the single crystal. Etching studies have yielded useful information on the effect of enamel structure on the pattern of acid dissolution at the microscopic level and have highlighted the importance of re-precipitation phenomena in modifying the pattern of mineral loss. High-resolution studies have provided interesting quantitative data on changes in crystal size, and also information on changes in crystal shape and orientation, during lesion formation and remineralization. However, further work is required in this area to clarify uncertainties about sampling bias and to relate the observed changes more precisely to the larger-scale structure of the tissue. Numerous observations on the surface morphology and internal structure of carious lesions have been made but preparation techniques used to date introduce artifact to a greater or lesser extent and interpretation of some of these results is therefore handicapped. We propose the use of a methacrylate replication technique as the method of choice for studying pore distribution in carious enamel and present preliminary results using this technique.", "PMC2394805": "The intestinal colonization rate of Aeromonas spp. was determined for 52 cesarean-born Peruvian neonates. Rectal swabs were obtained daily from newborns during their postdelivery hospitalization (mean = 5.5 days), and the gross appearances of their feces (blind determinations) were recorded. Aeromonas spp. were recovered from rectal swabs of 12 of 52 (23.1%) infants during their first week of life; the isolates were obtained from 5 of 9 (55.6%) infants with at least one stool with a watery consistency and from 7 of 43 (16.3%) neonates with no watery stools (P = 0.022). None of the infected infants became clinically ill. No other commonly recognized enteropathogens were detected in watery stools. An environmental survey indicated that hospital water was the probable source of infection.

The conserved regions consist of a 25-bp region between nt positions 23 and 47 and a 16-bp region between nt positions 245 and 260. The 16-bp region corresponds to the region of 7SL RNA that is claimed to fold and become paired with the internal promoter sequence.

The magnitude of the level of proteinase activity detected was not dependent on tumor burden. Similar elevations in activity were detected with all 3 variants when they were transplanted either subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. However, transplantation of the B16-F10 line to the anterior chamber of the eye did not induce elevated plasma proteinase activity. Animals bearing intraocular tumors developed splenomegaly and lived the same length of time as animals bearing intraperitoneal or subcutaneous tumors. The development of increased levels of activity appeared to occur equally in male and female mice and was not dependent on the presence of a spleen, which undergoes enlargement during the disease process. These various lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the elevated level of plasma proteinase activity observed in melanoma-bearing mice is regulated by the host.", "PMC3515690": "Eighty-seven organ transplant recipients developed 88 tumors after immunosuppression with CsA. The neoplasms showed important differences from those seen following conventional immunosuppressive therapy (CIT). Malignancies appeared an average of 14 months (range, 1 to 82) after CsA and 59 months (range, 1.0 to 225.5) after CIT. Cancers were particularly common among recipients of extrarenal organs. NHLs were the most common neoplasms comprising 52%, compared with 12% in CIT patients. They appeared an average of 8.5 months after transplantation, compared with an average of 41 months after CIT. Unlike NHLs in CIT patients, they more often involved lymph nodes, were more widespread, more frequently involved the small intestine, rarely involved the brain, were more likely to regress, and had a better prognosis following reduction of immunosuppressive therapy. Skin cancers (13% of cancers) were less common than in CIT patients (40%). Kaposi's sarcomas were more common (10% v 3%). Some tumors commonly seen after CIT, including in situ uterine cervical carcinomas and carcinomas of the vulva/perineum, have not occurred in CsA patients. In this small series, there was a surprising frequency of endocrine-related malignancies (ovarian, testicular, breast, and thyroid) and renal cell carcinomas. Longer follow-up and study of larger numbers of patients will determine whether differences from CIT patients will persist. Only seven (8%) patients were treated only with CsA, the remainder received other immunosuppressive agents, mainly prednisone.

Combined analysis indicated that four DR antigens are positively associated with the condition in Negroid subjects - DR3, 4, 7 and w9. DR3 and 4 are also associated in Caucasians, but the relative risk for DR3 is lower in Negroid subjects. The DR7 association is specific for the Negroid race, and DRw9 is only weakly associated in Caucasoid subjects. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis demonstrated a DQ beta restriction pattern in Negroid subjects which is absent from Caucasoid subjects. This pattern was associated with DRw9 and a subset of DR7, and was markedly increased in frequency in diabetic patients compared with control subjects (48.7% vs 10.4%, respectively; p less than 10(-4). In the absence of this pattern, DR7 showed no positive association. DR3 in Negroid subjects was associated with two distinct DQ alpha-DQ beta patterns, only one of which was positively associated with diabetes. A DQ beta pattern, in linkage disequilibrium with different DR antigens in different races, conferred a consistent protective effect against the development of Type 1 diabetes. Trans-racial genetic analysis thus supports a primary role for DQ in susceptibility to Type 1 diabetes.", "PMC1854907": "Tensile tests on longitudinal and circumferential strips of the rabbit aorta have been performed.

The level of IR-CRH in maternal plasma increased progressively during pregnancy, increased further at delivery and declined rapidly to the non-pregnant level on the 1st day postpartum. The level of IR-F in maternal plasma also increased progressively during pregnancy, increased further at delivery, but decreased slowly postpartum, not returning to the non-pregnant level within 5 days. Significant correlations were found between the level of IR-CRH and IR-ACTH, IR-CRH and IR-F, and IR-ACTH and IRF in maternal plasma both during pregnancy and after delivery. It is noteworthy that the concentration of IR-CRH in the maternal plasma at delivery was higher in multiple pregnancy than in normal pregnancy, and that the level of IR-CRH in the umbilical cord in uncomplicated cases was much lower than that in the maternal plasma, and was significantly lower than those in the umbilical cord plasma in cases of asphyxia, IUGR or premature delivery. The level of IR-F, not IR-CRH and IR-ACTH, at normal vaginal delivery was significantly higher than that at elective cesarean section.

Diphosphoinositide (DPI) synthesis in rat mast cell granules was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [gamma 32] ATP into DPI in the absence of exogenous phosphatidylinositol (PI). Lipids were isolated with methanol/chloroform/HCl and were separated by thin-layer chromatography on oxalic acid impregnated silica gel plates. DPI areas were identified by staining with iodine, scraped and measured for 32P radioactivity. The addition of polyamines, spermine and spermidine to the granules caused an increase in DPI synthesis, which can be catalyzed by PI kinase. This effect of polyamines on DPI synthesis in the rat mast cell granules was dose-dependent and maximal effects were observed at 1 mM spermine and 10 mM spermidine respectively. When the effect of 1 mM spermine on 32P incorporation into DPI in rat mast cell granules was investigated serially, 32P incorporation into DPI in rat mast cell granules incubated with spermine for 15 min was enhanced significantly (p less than 0.05) compared with that in the granules in the absence of spermine.", "PMC2556093": "We have developed a new method using a computerized photodiode-array spectrophotometer (CPAS), to characterize the biosynthesis and the inhibition of leukotriene (LT) B4, C4, D4 and E4 in calcium ionophore (Ca-I)-stimulated whole blood.

The use of CPAS enabled us to identify and measure LTs from 2 ml volume of Ca-I stimulated whole blood as well as to check the purity of LTs, without any use of radioimmunoassay or bioassay. 2. LTC4 produced in whole blood was almost completely converted to LTE4 after 80 min incubation, and at this time both the production of LTE4 and LTB4 reached a plateau and remained constant thereafter. 3.

We have isolated mutants carrying mutations in one of the membrane-bound components of the histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium that allow transport in the absence of both histidine-binding proteins HisJ and LAO (lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein). All of the mutations are located in a limited region of the nucleotide-binding component of the histidine permease, HisP. The mutants transported substrate in the absence of binding proteins only when the membrane-bound complex was produced in large amounts. At low (chromosomal) levels, the mutant complex was unable to transport substrate in the absence of binding proteins but transported it efficiently in the presence of HisJ. The alterations responsible for the mutations were identified by DNA sequencing; they are closely related to a group of hisP mutations isolated as suppressors of HisJ interaction mutations (G. F.-L. Ames and E. N. Spudich, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 73:1877-1881, 1976).

Unloading of the soleus muscle diminished primarily myofibrillar proteins whereas stretching increased all proteins. Stretching the soleus increased RNA, accelerated, especially, in vitro synthesis of sarcoplasmic proteins, and diminished in vitro proteolysis. Both in vivo and in vitro results showed slower synthesis and faster degradation in the freely moving than in the weight-bearing soleus muscle, faster synthesis and slower degradation in the stretched than in the freely moving soleus muscle, and faster degradation in the stretched than in the weight-bearing soleus muscle. Hence, stretching of the soleus muscle prevented changes in mass and protein metabolism produced by unloading. Shortening of the extensor digitorum longus muscle produced less muscle growth, slowed in vitro protein synthesis, and lowered RNA relative to the contralateral, freely moving muscle.", "PMC2689226": "Removal of the extrinsic 33 kDa polypeptide increased the accessibility to trypsin of a COOH-terminal tridecapeptide epitope of the alpha subunit of cytochrome b-559 (psbE gene product). The sensitivity of the cytochrome epitope to trypsin was not measurably affected by removal of the 16 and 23 kDa extrinsic polypeptides, nor increased by removal of the OEC manganese along with the 33 kDa protein. While protecting alpha-cytochrome b-559 against trypsin, the 33 kDa protein is also proteolyzed, suggesting the possibility of an additional protein component involved in the shielding of the cytochrome. Shielding of the COOH-terminal epitope of alpha-cytochrome b-559 by the OEC 33 kDa protein implies that these COOH-terminal chains of the cytochrome are part of a protein network in the lumen space near the photosystem II reaction center. This network may contain residues that are involved in the binding of essential OEC metal ions.", "PMC3581401": "A retrospective survey of 3,585 patients aged newborn to 20 years was performed to investigate the prevalence of intraoperative respiratory complications in patients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). There were no significant differences in complication rates between asymptomatic patients (1.61 per 100) and those with symptoms (1.64 per 100); however, patients who were asymptomatic but had a recent history of an URI had a significantly higher complication rate (5.31 per 100; p less than 0.05) than the asymptomatic patients. There were no significant differences in intraoperative complications between patients managed with and without tracheal intubation, nor was there any association between the type of anaesthetic agent used and the development of intraoperative respiratory complications. Results from the study suggest no increased risk of respiratory complications for patients presenting with uncomplicated URIs.

A partial repletion occurred, 3 h after the cellulose sulphate injection, which was followed by a secondary fall in plasma kininogen. Plasma kininogen values were back to control levels 10 h after the treatment in all groups.3 Treatment of rats from days 19-22 of pregnancy with cellulose sulphate resulted in 40% depletion of plasma kininogen and in prolongation of pre-parturition behaviour.4 It is suggested that the increase which normally occurs in plasma kininogen levels towards the end of pregnancy in the rat may play a role in the process of parturition.", "PMC2811192": "Formation, structure and composition of the preocular fluid and its distribution at the surface of the eye ball are discussed in detail.

The need for this type of program is shown by the increased population of infants born at high risk for respiratory diseases, as well as the centralization of high risk newborn care at the tertiary center, leaving many physicians without the experience or skill to stabilize and manage premature and term infants with respiratory problems.

Administered via aerosol, ribavirin will be deposited rather uniformly on the surface of the nasopharynx, the tracheobronchial tree and in the pulmonary area. Examples of aerosol-delivered dosages found to be effective in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection and influenza A and B virus infections are as follows: 12.8 mg of ribavirin/hour for a 6-month-old infant weighing 7.5 kg, and 56.2 kg of ribavirin/hour for a 25-year-old adult weighing 62.5 kg. Drugs which are relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions can also be administered in small particle aerosol by using liposomes as a vehicle. The preparation of enviroxime, a potent anti-rhinovirus drug, in liposomes for aerosol use is reported here.

We have reviewed the clinical and pathological features of 16 lymphoma-like lesions of the cervix (10 cases), endometrium (five cases), and vulva (one case) and compared these features with those of malignant lymphoma. One patient with a cervical lesion and one with a vulvar lesion had infectious mononucleosis. Microscopic examination of the lesions revealed an infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with prominent mitotic activity, including cleaved and noncleaved follicular center cells and immunoblasts; a starry-sky pattern was present in three cases. Plasma cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and small lymphocytes were present within the infiltrate in many of the cases. Immunohistochemical stains were performed in seven cases. In six they indicated the presence of polyclonal plasma cells; most of the atypical large cells did not stain for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. In the seventh specimen many immunoblasts had cytoplasmic staining of polyclonal type. The microscopic features of the lesions differ from those of lymphomas. Surface ulceration and intralesional acute inflammatory cells and plasma cells are rarely seen in lymphomas, while a large size, deep invasion, cellular monomorphism, and prominent sclerosis were not seen in the reactive lymphoma-like lesions. Follow-up of from 6 months to 12 years was available for 10 of the 16 patients, nine of whom were treated by procedures inadequate for the cure of malignant lymphoma, and has been uneventful in all of them. The clinical and pathologic features of these cases suggest that the atypical appearances in most of them resulted from a focally florid lymphoid proliferation in association with chronic cervicitis or endometritis, or a generalized disorder of lymphoid cells such as infectious mononucleosis.", "PMC2615192": "The baseline hematologic status of 27 patients with modest degrees of aluminum overload was examined. In addition, hematologic data were evaluated in 19 of these patients during and after treatment with DFO. Although neither severe anemia nor microcytosis was observed pretreatment, there was a significant correlation between hemoglobin level and degree of aluminum burden as determined by bone surface aluminum staining (r = -0.58; P less than 0.007). Following treatment with DFO, hemoglobin concentration increased dramatically by 1.3 to 4.4 g/dl in eight patients but did not change in the remaining eleven. Responders and nonresponders were similar with regard to the degree of aluminum overload both before and after chelation therapy but differed with regard to baseline levels of erythropoietin (higher in responders) and degree of iron overload (greater in nonresponders). Pretherapy levels of red cell ALA dehydratase were depressed in all patients (32 +/- 4 vs. 56 +/- 5 U/g Hb in normals) but did not correlate with the degree of aluminum overload and did not change with chelation therapy. Pretherapy levels of red cell protoporphyrin were elevated in 15 of 24 patients (62%) and were higher in responders than in nonresponders.

The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of this product at steady-state between healthy volunteers and two different patient groups with inflammation of either the small or the large bowel. Two carefully selected groups of patients, nine with Crohn's disease restricted to the small intestine and ten with total ulcerative colitis and one group of ten healthy volunteers received two 250 mg Mesasal tablets three times daily for 10 days to reach steady-state. Plasma 5-ASA and acetyl-5-ASA concentrations were followed for 48 h and urinary excretion for 72 h. There was a great variation in most pharmacokinetic parameters within each group and no significant differences were noticed between the groups.

A 4-week single-blind placebo run-in/screening period, during which no antihypertensive medication was given, was followed by 3 consecutive 4-week treatment periods with placebo or celiprolol (200 mg or 400 mg daily). At the end of the 4-week placebo run-in/screening period, 26 hospital out-patients with a seated mean blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) of 161.4/101.7 mmHg and a mean pulse rate of 75 beats/min entered the double-blind crossover phase of the study. Results showed that there was no significant difference in seated mean systolic or diastolic blood pressure between 200 mg celiprolol daily (149.2/92.3 mmHg) and 400 mg celiprolol daily (149.1/92.5 mmHg). However, mean seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower on celiprolol than on placebo (157.1/98.2 mmHg). Neither dose of celiprolol had a significant effect on seated pulse rate. No patient was withdrawn due to an adverse event and no laboratory assessment outside the normal range was reported to be of any clinical significance. It is concluded that oral celiprolol, 200 mg or 400 mg daily, is effective and well tolerated for controlling mild to moderate essential hypertension. Since both doses had very similar effects on blood pressure there is no advantage in this group of patients for the 400 mg daily dose of celiprolol.", "PMC3591093": "Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi develop slowly.

A clone containing the core-histone genes was isolated from a annelid genomic library constructed in the EMBL-4 phage vector, using a trout H3 genomic probe. This clone was found to contain two and a half repeats of a 6-kbp EcoRV fragment that contained one copy of each of the core-histone genes. The clusters are tandemly arrayed in the genome and the gene order within the core-histone cluster does not vary. Absolutely no differences were found in the nucleotide sequences comprising the same part of two adjacent clusters (bases -225 to 2776 and bases 5821 to 8825). The number of copies of the cluster appeared to be high: approximately 660 copies/diploid cell, as also observed in sea urchins and amphibians. There are also some additional subtypes of histone gene organization: multimers of tandemly arrayed genes and isolated genes; these are present at a much lower copy number (an average of 40-50 copies/diploid genome). Two mRNAs (for H2B and H3) are transcribed from one DNA strand and the two other histone mRNAs (for H2A and H4) from the other strand as is the case for some insects and certain vertebrates. No H1-coding sequence has been found in the completely sequenced four-membered cluster.

All of the patients had nonspecific symptoms of fever and cough; however, none exhibited the classic findings of dyspnea, wheezing, or hemoptysis. Smears of sputum were nondiagnostic. The chest x-ray film revealed mediastinal adenopathy in two patients and a lower lobe consolidation in the third; all had small ipsilateral pleural effusions. Endobronchial lesions were white or pink exophytic masses obstructing the airways, mimicking bronchogenic carcinoma. Areas of \"classic\" primary tuberculosis were seen in two of the patients. Despite ongoing clinical and roentgenographic deterioration, all patients responded well to antituberculosis medications.

Here, a fraction which stimulated initiation at the correct site, provisionally called \"initiation correcting factor\" (ICF), was partially purified from Krebs-2 cells. The ICF activity appeared to copurify with a complex of initiation factors eIF-2 and eIF-2B. The ability of ICF to stimulate, in reticulocyte lysates, the correct initiation of translation on the RNAs from neurovirulent and attenuated type 1 and type 3 poliovirus strains was investigated. Like crude initiation factor preparations, ICF appeared to be relatively less active with the RNAs from attenuated strains, the difference being especially pronounced for the type 3 strains. For the latter strains, the data suggested an important role of the nucleotide at, and perhaps around, position 472 in determining a response to the addition of ICF. It is proposed that interaction of a specific segment of the viral RNA with one or more of initiation factors plays an important part in the mechanism of translation of the picornavirus genomes, poliovirus attenuation, and, possibly, pathogenesis of poliomyelitis.", "PMC3230378": "Sensitive enzyme immunoassays for the determination of total leukocyte neutral proteinase inhibitor and polymorphonuclear elastase-leukocyte neutral proteinase inhibitor complexes are described.

Three separate meta-analysis were conducted to quantitatively review the exercise-anxiety literature for state anxiety, trait anxiety and psychophysiological correlates of anxiety. Such a procedure allows tendencies of the research to be characterised. The results substantiate the claim that exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety, but only for aerobic forms of exercise. These effects were generally independent of both subject (i.e. age and health status) and descriptive characteristics. Numerous design characteristics were different, but these differences were not uniform across the 3 meta-analyses. For state anxiety, exercise was associated with reduced anxiety, but had effects similar to other known anxiety-reducing treatments (e.g. relaxation). The trait anxiety meta-analysis revealed that random assignment was important for achieving larger effects when compared to the use of intact groups. Training programmes also need to exceed 10 weeks before significant changes in trait anxiety occur. For psychophysiological correlates, cardiovascular measures of anxiety (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate) yielded significantly smaller effects than did other measures (e.g. EMG, EEG). The only variable that was significant across all 3 meta-analyses was exercise duration. Exercise of at least 21 minutes seems necessary to achieve reductions in state and trait anxiety, but there were variables confounding this relationship. As such, it remains to be seen what the minimum duration is necessary for anxiety reduction. Although exercise offers therapeutic benefits for reducing anxiety without the dangers or costs of drug therapy or psychotherapy, it remains to be determined precisely why exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety. Since several mechanisms may be operating simultaneously, future research should be designed with the idea of testing interactions between these mechanisms.", "PMC3979679": "In order to elucidate the role of the vagus nerve in the release of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), mongrel dogs were given a 4-min intraduodenal infusion of 10 g glucose or 5 g soybean oil before and again 1 month after truncal vagotomy (TV). The basal GIP concentrations were significantly elevated after TV. The plasma GIP levels following glucose infusion in the vagotomized dogs were significantly higher than those in the untreated dogs, whereas the GIP levels following fat infusion were not affected by TV. These results suggest that TV influences glucose-induced GIP release but not fat-induced GIP release, indicating that different mechanisms of the vagus nerve may be involved in glucose- and fat-induced GIP secretions.", "PMC3488048": "A 29-year-old Haitian man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome presented with nasal obstruction and epistaxis.

The former process appears to be more prevalent, with the latter restricted to vessels that form near the endoderm-mesoderm interface. The contributions of endothelial cells formed by each of these processes to specific blood vessels has not been defined, however, nor have the origins of precursors (angioblasts) of intraembryonic endothelial populations been established. To identify the origins of endothelial cells, precursor populations from quail embryos were transplanted into chick embryos. Antibodies that recognize quail endothelial cells were applied to sections from chimeric embryos fixed 2-5 days after surgery. These experiments reveal that all intraembryonic mesodermal tissues, except the notochord and prechordal plate, contain angiogenic precursors. Many angioblasts emigrate from the grafted tissue, invading surrounding mesenchyme and contributing to the formation of arteries, veins, and capillaries in a wide area. The invasive behavior of these angioblasts is unlike that of any other embryonic mesenchymal cell type and represents a third process operating during embryonic blood vessel formation. Transplanted angioblasts, even those excised from quail trunk regions, form normal craniofacial vascular channels, including the cardiac outflow tract. These results demonstrate that the control over blood vessel assembly resides within the connective tissue-forming mesenchyme of the embryo, not within endothelial precursors.", "PMC2239268": "We have studied the effects on lung volume, respiratory mechanics and ventilation during the first hours after instillation of 60 mg/kg of human surfactant into the trachea of 4 very preterm, newborn infants with severe IRDS under mechanical ventilation. Measurements were made with a \"face-out\" body plethysmograph and a modified nitrogen wash-out method. In addition to a transient decrease in total and alveolar ventilation immediately after the instillation we found an immediate rise in lung volume, but respiratory compliance decreased. These changes lasted less than two hours. Oxygen requirements fell in 3 out of 4 infants. The changes in lung volume and compliance are explained in terms of changes in the shape of the static recoil pressure characteristics of the diseased lungs after treatment.

Low intensities of either stimulus elicited slow repetitive firing. Each action potential was preceded by a slow depolarizing prepotential (SPP), lasting 50-300 ms and was followed by fast (3-5 ms) and slow (more than 100 ms) afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs). The SPPs, and AHPs were indistinguishable for the two types of stimuli. In response to strong depolarizations, most cells showed an initial burst of spikes, followed by a pause before the steady discharge. This pattern was elicited by both glutamate and current. The input resistance usually increased 5-20% during subthreshold depolarizations by glutamate or current. In contrast, large doses of glutamate caused a slow decline in the resistance (up to 40%), which was larger than during comparable current-induced discharge, and the response was followed by a longer AHP. It is concluded that both dendritic and somatic depolarization, induced by glutamate and current, respectively, can elicit sustained repetitive firing with SPPs, fast and slow AHPs and burst-pause pattern, thus, increasing the likelihood that these phenomena play a role during natural activation of CA1 cells.", "PMC3706463": "We used electro-oculographic recordings of eye movement responses to a dynamic random-dot stereogram to assess stereopsis in normal infants and in infants with congenital esotropia.

No patient with congenital esotropia showed evidence of stereopsis when tested at a postoperative interval of more than two weeks.", "PMC3953482": "The losses of iron in whole body cell-free sweat were determined in eleven healthy men. A new experimental design was used with a very careful cleaning procedure of the skin and repeated consecutive sampling periods of sweat in a sauna. The purpose was to achieve a steady state of sweat iron losses with minimal influence from iron originating from desquamated cells and iron contaminating the skin. A steady state was reached in the third sauna period (second sweat sampling period). Iron loss was directly related to the volume of sweat lost and amounted to 22.5 micrograms iron/l sweat. The findings indicate that iron is a physiological constituent of sweat and derived not only from contamination. Present results imply that variations in the amount of sweat lost will have only a marginal effect on the variation in total body iron losses.", "PMC3690967": "Twenty children with fracture-separation of the entire distal humeral epiphysis have been reported.

Posteromedial displacement of the humeral fracture fragment together with the ulna and the radius most commonly occurs. The injury must be distinguished from dislocation of the elbow, fracture of the lateral condyle, and supracondylar fracture of the distal humerus.", "PMC3986869": "The kinetics of expression of radiation-induced micronuclei (MN) in synchronized Chinese hamster cells (CHO) was examined. The purpose of the study was to determine if the cell cycle distribution of a population significantly influences the levels of radiation induced MN, thereby obscuring the exact quantification of the radiation effect. Cells were synchronized by centrifugal elutriation, irradiated, and then different phases of the cell cycle were examined for: cell cycle progression, division probability, and temporal expression of MN. The results demonstrate that the time interval for maximal MN expression is long enough that the position of cells in the cell cycle and radiation induced division delays do not prevent the majority of cells from completing their first post-irradiation mitosis, therefore, expressing MN. By following the progression of synchronized cell populations by flow cytometry and also examining the time of division of individual cells for 24 hr after irradiation, we observed that the maximum number of cells from all phases of the cell cycle are in their first post-irradiation interphase at that time, thus explaining the MN results.", "PMC2171371": "Plasma noradrenaline and platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density (sites/cell using 3H-rauwolscine with and without phentolamine) were correlated with withdrawal score in 23 hospitalized patients undergoing ethanol withdrawal. Control groups for plasma noradrenaline were 25 patients admitted to hospital for elective gastroscopy and 12 laboratory workers accustomed to venipuncture. Controls for platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor measurements were a separate group of 31 normal subjects with a mean age close to that of the patients' withdrawing from ethanol. Plasma noradrenaline was significantly higher in the patients undergoing ethanol withdrawal than in patients admitted to hospital for elective endoscopy. Twelve laboratory controls had plasma noradrenaline levels significantly lower than either patient group. A significant though poor statistical correlation existed between ethanol withdrawal score and simultaneously determined plasma noradrenaline level. Platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites/cell were reduced in ethanol withdrawal compared with the normal controls. Platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites/cell increased over the first 24 hr of ethanol withdrawal but remained significantly lower than control values. The change in platelet adrenoceptors was accompanied by a fall in mean plasma noradrenaline. Thus, the stress of hospital admission itself is associated with an increase in plasma noradrenaline, but ethanol withdrawal enhances this increase, which is accompanied by and probably causes a reduction in platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor numbers. These changes begin to return towards normal within 24 hr as the withdrawal reaction subsides.", "PMC2859599": "Old female rats exhibiting either the constant vaginal estrous (CE) or the prolonged diestrous (PD) state were given lergotrile mesylate (LM). Treatment with 4.5 mg/kg daily significantly reduced prolactin (PRL) levels in both groups. The basal luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were not altered. In the CE group, LM treatment produced a single prolonged cycle, with the reemergence of the CE state. However, in the PD group, the rats exhibited several regular cycles during the treatment period. Several of these rats also showed evidence of having an LH surge during the reinduced cycle. These results suggest that high PRL levels may be a causative factor with respect to acyclicity in the PD rats, but PRL does not seem to be a major contributor to acyclicity in the aged CE rat.", "PMC2670300": "Chemical carcinogens are generally activated enzymatically to electrophiles that form covalently bound carcinogen-DNA adducts. Detoxifying enzymes are competing with the activating enzymes for these procarcinogenic chemical substrates. Wide person-to-person variations in these two types of enzymatic activities are found. Repair rates of DNA damage caused by carcinogens also vary among individuals. These interindividual differences in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens and repair rates of carcinogen-induced DNA damage reflect acquired and inherited host factors that may influence an individual's risk for development of cancer.", "PMC3473065": "Brain damage following cranial radiation therapy can be crippling or even life-threatening and has been studied in both patients and animals. An additional toxic effect of chemotherapy has been found in children, who died following brain irradiation and systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To study the interaction of radiation and drugs on brain tissue, we treated rabbits with brain irradiation and/or i.v. methotrexate. For a period of up to 3 months following radiation therapy, brain morphology was compared in seven treatment groups. Weekly doses of methotrexate administered i.v. produced no brain damage. Histological examination showed myelin swelling and beading 14 weeks after fractionated brain irradiation with 24 Gy. Combination of brain irradiation and methotrexate produced additional hypertrophy of microglia and pyknosis of adventitial cells. In none of these groups, even after doses of 48 Gy brain irradiation, was calcification or brain necrosis observed during the first 14 weeks following irradiation.", "PMC4043118": "In an attempt to detect occult or intermittent rhinorrhea, 10 patients without and 9 cases with rhinorrhea were investigated after a lumbal injection of 1.3 mCi 111In-DTPA. Significant count rates were detectable in the nasal pledgets of all individuals, so that it was not possible to distinguish those with and those without rhinorrhea. Therefore, the ratio of activity in nasal pledgets and blood normalized for weight recommended by McKusick et al. was used. In the patients without evidence of rhinorrhea, the ratio did not exceed 2.0, whereas in 8 of the 9 cases with rhinorrhea, it was considerably increased.

Growth was equal to or surpassed that observed in Mueller-Hinton broth or on Mueller-Hinton blood agar. The final medium adopted consisted of medium 199 and a supplemental mixture of cysteine, glucose, and various salts. Addition of sodium bicarbonate or CO(2) enrichment was not required. For solidification, only agarose allowed growth of all strains; glutamic acid stimulated growth of two strains but was inhibitory for a third. The addition of 8% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 2% purified albumin, and penicillin resulted in induction of all three strains to the L-form with frequencies up to 0.3%. At present no induction to the L-form has been achieved in the absence of albumin. Various lots of PVP proved toxic in the defined medium, and extensive dialysis was required for good growth and L-form induction. Substitution of PVP with sucrose indicated a sucrose toxicity for the parental gonococcus even on the addition of albumin. L-form induction did occur on sucrose L-medium but at significantly lower frequencies. The colonies appeared 1 week later than those on PVP L-medium but at significantly lower frequencies. The colonies appeared 1 week later than those on PVP L-medium and remained very small and poorly developed.", "PMC3308792": "We investigated the distribution of microtubules and microfilaments in some exocrine and endocrine cells in rats. Microtubules were stained by applying an immunofluorescent technique using antibodies against beta-tubulin, while microfilaments were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, which binds selectively to polymerized actin filaments. In the cytoplasm of some exocrine cells (pancreatic acinar cells and ventral prostatic epithelial cells), the microtubules were distributed longitudinally from the apical region to the basal region, but no microtubules were found in the nuclear region. In exocrine cells, most of the microfilaments were localized beneath the apical plasma membrane. In some endocrine cells (those of the adenohypophysis and the islets of Langerhans), the microtubules exhibited a radial or reticular distribution in the cytoplasm, and intense fluorescence was observed in the perinuclear region. The immunofluorescence produced by the antibodies against beta-tubulin was more intense in endocrine cells than in exocrine cells. The microfilaments observed in the endocrine cells studied were homogenously distributed beneath the plasma membrane. Dot-like rhodamine-phalloidin staining was often observed in the cytoplasm of both the exocrine and endocrine cells. The present study clearly demonstrated marked differences in the distribution of cytoskeletal elements in exocrine and endocrine cells, and these may reflect differences in the secretory direction of such cells as well as in epithelial-cell polarity.", "PMC3817118": "Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin, hormones that can be used to induce superovulation, were administered to hybrid female mice (C57BL/6J X CBA/J) on known days of the estrous cycle, or when the mice were known to be acyclic, in order to determine whether certain reproductive states of the animals either enhanced or inhibited effects of the exogenous gonadotropins. Days of the estrous cycle on which the hormones were given did not significantly affect the numbers of animals that mated and in most cases did not affect embryo yield. When hormone treatment was initiated on the day of estrus in the 5-day cycle, the embryo yield was greater than when treatment was initiated on the first day of diestrus but even the difference between these groups had only marginal significance. Mice that were not exhibiting regular estrous cycles, some of which had been rendered acyclic by exposure to constant light, did not differ from mice with regular cycles in numbers that mated or in embryo yield following gonadotropin administration. When gonadotropin injection of regularly cycling mice was initiated on metestrus, on the first day of diestrus, or on estrus, the vaginal cycle was retarded as indicated by failure of cornified cells subsequently to predominate in vaginal smears at proestrus, estrus, or metestrus but initiation of hormone treatments on the second day of diestrus advanced the occurrence of vaginal cornification. Following gonadotropin injection, vaginal cornification became less reliable as a predictor of the time at which the animals would mate and ovulate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2800122": "Cochlear neuroepithelial cells contain a lot of mitochondria which is an indication of a high rate of metabolism in the organ. However, blood flow in the internal ear is low because vessels of the stria vascularis have no muscular layer or vasomotor innervation. Therefore in case of a disease reactive hyperemia which may lead to the restoration of blood supply should not be expected. Internal ear circulation may be influenced by compressing internal jugular veins to produce venous hypertension and hyperemia. Rabbit experiments in which internal jugular veins were ligated showed that the concentration of a labeled substance in the ear preparation increased by 72.8% within an hour after intravenous injection as compared to the controls. This effect is due to an increase of transcapillary filtration and transmural permeability in the terminal circulation area. However, venous hyperemia has certain disadvantages which makes it necessary to develop better approaches to blood from control as a method of therapy of internal ear diseases.", "PMC3350770": "The incidence and severity of audiogenic seizures in kanamycin (KM)-treated rat pups, from a Wistar strain which is inherently seizure-resistant, was analyzed as a function of (a) postnatal age at the time of KM injection (i.p.) and (b) KM dosage. The vigor of the pinna reflex response on postnatal day (PND) 28 was correlated with (a) age at the time of injection, (b) dosage and (c) individual audiogenic seizure severity scores on PND 28 or PND 32. The data indicate that PNDs 9-12 are the developmental period when the rat has its greatest sensitivity to induction of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures by KM. The pinna reflex data suggest that cochlear vulnerability to KM intoxication is also greatest during this period. The optimum dosage for the induction of susceptibility was 100 mg/kg X 4 days. Use of higher doses resulted in a reduction of both incidence and severity of audiogenic seizures. The pinna reflex generally exhibited a supranormal vigor in animals having the most severe seizures. The behavioral attributes of induced audiogenic seizures at postnatal ages of 28 and 32 days are described and discussed.", "PMC2802877": "Intragastric administration of rifampicin to rats in a dose of 40 mg/kg resulted in decreasing of the contents of grampositive cocci and lactobacilli and increasing of the number of gramnegative aerobic potentially pathogenic bacteria in feces of the experimental animals. It was noted that along with changes in the composition of the fecal microflora after the exposure to the antibiotic there were disorders in feces excretion of ammonia and amino acids such as alanine and glutamic acid as well as lactic, amber, butyric, valeric and alpha-ketoglutaric acids. Reduction of the changed biochemical indices was shown to be slower than that of the routine microbiological indices.", "PMC4051504": "One of the practical difficulties with the frequently proposed use of liposomes for delivery of water-soluble substances to cells in whole organisms is that liposomes are relatively unstable during storage. We have studied the ability of trehalose, a carbohydrate commonly found at high concentrations in organisms capable of surviving dehydration, to stabilize dry liposomes. With trehalose both inside and outside the bilayer, almost 100% of trapped solute was retained in rehydrated vesicles previously freeze-dried with 1.8 g trehalose/g dry phospholipid. Trehalose is very effective at inhibiting fusion between liposomes during drying, as assessed by freeze-fracture and resonance energy transfer between fluorescent probes incorporated into the bilayer. However, inhibition of fusion alone does not account for the preservation of the dry liposomes, since the concentration of trehalose required to prevent leakage is more than 10-fold that required to prevent fusion. We provide evidence that stabilization of the dry liposomes requires depression of transition temperature and consequent maintenance of the constituent lipids in the dry liposomes in a liquid crystalline phase.", "PMC3756528": "Jpalm, the rate of incorporation of plasma palmitate into brain, was determined in awake Fischer-344 rats at 15, 20, 25 and 38 days of age, by a modification of the method of Kimes et al. [14C]palmitate was injected intravenously and plasma-specific activity of unesterified palmitate was followed until the animals were killed at 4 h, when radioactivity was determined by quantitative autoradiography in 45 individual brain regions. Jpalm was calculated as the 4 h brain radioactivity divided by integrated plasma palmitate-specific activity to 4 h. Jpalm rose between 15 and 20 days of age in gray and white matter regions, then declined 4-5-fold in gray matter and 7-10-fold in white matter by 38 days and reached adult levels by 3 months. The white/gray ratio for Jpalm declined significantly between 20 and 38 days, and between 38 days and 3 months of age, consistent with a lower rate of turnover of white matter lipids in the mature brain. The results support the use of the Jpalm technique to measure brain lipid synthesis and turnover. They show that Jpalm corresponds to the time course of myelination during development of the rat brain, when there are parallel changes in the rates of palmitate incorporation into gray and white matter regions.", "PMC2654154": "The aim of this study is a current review of multidisciplinary therapeutic concepts in severe acute pancreatitis, the following being envisaged in succession: --severity criteria and factors involved in surveillance, --medical methods of intensive therapy, --surgical treatment in terms of its indications and tactical implications.

Striking differences in morphology and function of male and female dopaminergic neurons were observed. Outgrowth of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive processes initially proceeded at a faster rate in female than in male cultures. Morphological differences disappeared in cultures of gestational day 17. Irrespective of the age of the cultures and of the length of cultivation, the uptake capacity for (3H)dopamine per immunoreactive neuron was twice as high in female than in male cultures. Treatment of the cultures with sex steroids did not influence morphology, numbers or transmitter uptake of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons.

Microsphere myocardial blood flow was measured for correlation with serial regional changes in MR signal intensity. Significant difference in gadolinium-enhanced MR signal intensity existed between the hypoperfused LAD and the hyperemic left circumflex perfusion beds (46 +/- 22% vs 78 +/- 29% above baseline, respectively; P less than 0.05).

Seventy-seven patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulceration were entered into a double-blind, controlled study and randomized to treatment with sucralfate 2 g 2 i.d. (on waking and at bedtime) or 1 g 4 i.d. (1/2 h before meals and at bedtime). The patients were endoscoped before entry into the study, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks if unhealed at 4 weeks. Of the patients considered suitable for analysis at 4 weeks, 79% (26/33) of those taking 2 g 2 i.d. had healed ulcers in comparison to 72% (23/32) of those taking 1 g 4 i.d. After 8 weeks, cumulative healing rates were 85% (28/33) and 80% (24/30), respectively.

The appearance of nitrogenase mRNA (measured by dot blot hybridization analysis) and nitrogenase activity (measured as acetylene-reducing activity) was followed, and the cells were also observed by phase-contrast microscopy. Nitrogenase mRNA could be detected after 1.5 to 2.0 h of nitrogen starvation; enzyme activity appeared about 1 h later. Although enzyme activity increased for many hours, mRNA levels reached a steady state rapidly. Neither heterocysts nor proheterocysts formed under these conditions; however, the cells were observed to shrink and become chlorotic.

In particular, postmarketing surveillance should be expanded to include the quantification of patients' values, a drug's beneficial effects, and its adverse effects.

Cranial irradiation (CRT) has been implicated as the major cause for cognitive dysfunction. To clarify the etiology, incidence, and severity of intellectual compromise in children with brain tumors after CRT, a prospective study was undertaken comparing the neuropsychological outcome in 18 consecutive children with malignant brain tumors treated with CRT to outcome in 14 children harboring brain tumors in similar sites in the nervous system who had not received CRT. Children with cortical or subcortical brain tumors were not eligible for study. Neuropsychological testing was performed after surgery prior to radiotherapy, after radiotherapy, and at 1- and 2-year intervals thereafter. Children who had received CRT had a mean full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) of 105 at diagnosis which fell to 91 by Year 2. Similar declines were noted in their performance intelligence quotient (IQ) and verbal IQ. After CRT, patients demonstrated a statistically significant decline from baseline in FSIQ (p less than 0.02) and verbal IQ (p less than 0.04). Children who had not received CRT did not demonstrate a fall in any cognitive parameter over time. The decline between baseline testing and testing performed at Year 2 in patients who had CRT was inversely correlated with age (p less than 0.02), as younger children demonstrated the greatest loss of intelligence. Children less than 7 years of age at diagnosis had a mean decline in FSIQ of 25 points 2 years posttreatment. No other clinical parameter correlated with the overall IQ or decline in IQ. After CRT, children demonstrated a wide range of dysfunction including deficits in fine motor, visual-motor, and visual-spatial skills and memory difficulties. After CRT, children with brain tumors also demonstrated a fall in a wide range of achievement scores and an increased need, over time, for special help in school. The 2-year results of this study suggest that children with brain tumors treated with CRT are cognitively impaired and that these deficits worsen over time. The younger the child is at the time of treatment, the greater is the likelihood and severity of damage. These children, although not retarded, have a multitude of neurocognitive deficits which detrimentally affects school performance.

Odds ratios were 52.0 for AIDs and 7.8 for seropositivity for more than 100 sexual partners versus 0-5 partners when antibody-negative neighborhood controls were compared with cases and with antibody-positive neighborhood controls, respectively. Odds ratios were only 2.9 and 3.4 when antibody-negative clinic controls were compared with cases and with antibody-positive clinic controls, respectively. Odds ratios of 4.6-7.3 for rectal receptivity with most or all partners versus none or one partner were statistically significant, independent of the number of partners.

Apparent incidence of the phenotype was 562 per million infants; this rate is seven times higher than for classic cystinuria in the adult segment of the Quebec population. We studied longitudinally 26 probands 2 to 4 months of age. Initially, each excreted cystine and dibasic amino acids at much higher levels than did normal infants or either parent. From parental phenotypes (heterozygous or homozygous normal) and urine amino acid excretion values at 6 months of age in probands, the infants were classified as either heterozygous for the various classic cystinuria genotypes--type I (\"silent\"), eight infants; type II (high excretor), three; type III (moderate excretor), nine--or homozygous (and genetic compound), six. Urine amino acid excretion diminished steadily with age, to reach the variant parental value in heterozygous infants but not in homozygotes. Cystinuria heterozygotes, with the possible exception of some type I individuals, could not be distinguished reliably from homozygotes in early infancy, although homozygotes had significantly higher excretion values as a group. We deduce that renal ontogeny amplifies phenotypic expression of cystinuria alleles, thus influencing correct classification of genotype (heterozygote vs homozygote, and type of allele).

Only patients with therapeutic serum digoxin levels (range 0.5 to 1.9 ng/ml; mean 1.1 +/- 0.5) at the time of cardioversion were included. Patients with acute myocardial ischemia or unstable angina, serious electrolyte disturbance or those requiring class I antiarrhythmic agents for control of ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias were excluded. Ambulatory electrocardiograms were recorded for 24 hours before and 6 hours after cardioversion. No patient developed malignant ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular triplets or tachycardia) in the immediate 3 hour period after cardioversion. Furthermore, there were no significant (p less than 0.05) differences in the frequency of ventricular premature beats or couplets before and after cardioversion. To determine whether the level of serum digoxin or the strength of the applied shock had a significant effect on the development of postcardioversion arrhythmias, the change in frequency of single premature ventricular beats after cardioversion was compared with the serum digoxin level (ng/ml) and the applied energy level (joules) by means of linear regression analysis.

Doxorubicin should be administered preferably as 3-weekly bolus injections at doses higher than 60 mg/m2 because of its dose-response relationship. In combination chemotherapy ADIC and CYVADIC are probably the best choice. Although there are no definite data on increased activity with the addition of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and vincristine (VCR) to ADIC, we prefer CYVADIC because of the higher reported complete response rate. A limited number of patients with soft tissue sarcomas achieving a complete response with chemotherapy, will probably be cured, and for this reason it is important to aim at achieving a complete response. Preoperative intraarterial chemotherapy in locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas may further improve survival results, but before definite conclusions can be drawn, this technique should be investigated in randomized studies. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy should still be considered investigational, as no advantage has been observed in head, neck and trunk lesions, while data on extremity lesions are still conflicting.", "PMC3540032": "The efficacy of oral ketorolac 5 mg and 10 mg taken qid was compared in a randomized double-blind study with that of oral diflunisal 500 mg bid (interleaved with placebo twice daily) and of placebo, in 120 patients suffering at least moderate pain following meniscectomy. The trial comprised two phases: (1) an acute phase (the first postoperative day) and (2) a chronic phase (days 2-5 postoperatively). Acutely, pain was assessed before drug administration, and then 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 9.0 hours after the first dose. The second of the four daily doses was administered at four hours after the first dose. During the chronic phase, pain was assessed using visual analogue scales at 8 AM and 4 PM daily. The acute phase results show that all the active treatments were statistically significantly superior to placebo but were not distinguished from each other. Over the chronic phase, ketorolac 5 mg and placebo showed similar results, with diflunisal showing the least pain relief and ketorolac 10 mg the most. All the active treatments showed a low incidence of side effects and, in an overall evaluation, no one treatment was distinguishable. Ketorolac would seem to be an acceptable therapy for acute postoperative pain.", "PMC1635308": "A micturitional history of unselected 110 patients with Parkinson's disease revealed that 66 (60%) had urinary symptoms such as irritative in 28%, obstructive in 11%, and both symptoms in 21%. The frequency of urinary symptoms statistically correlated with severity of the disease, but not with the duration of illness and no sexual difference was noted. A urodynamic study was conducted in 39 patients and 7 had residual urine of 30 ml or more, 19 had detrusor hyperreflexia, 19 had a small bladder capacity and only 1 had detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. The results indicate that the disturbed urine storage is more frequent and to a severer degree than that of urine evacuation in Parkinson's disease.", "PMC3216966": "The prevailing sentiment of North American neurosurgeons is that there is no significant difference in overall morbidity between patients who are treated with early aneurysm surgery and those who are treated with delayed aneurysm surgery. This concept is based primarily on the high incidence of ischemic events after early intervention. Recent experience, however, indicates that prophylactic hypervolemic hypertensive therapy may be beneficial in reducing delayed ischemia after early aneurysm surgery. During the preceding 21 months, we have performed 125 operations for intracranial aneurysms. Fifty-six patients in this group presented less than 7 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (47 within 3 days) and were treated by a prospective protocol of urgent aneurysm surgery performed within 24 hours after presentation. In all cases, the aneurysm was clipped with the use of mannitol and spinal drainage for brain relaxation. All patients were then treated with prophylactic volume expansion therapy and induced hypertension with a central venous pressure or a Swan-Ganz catheter until the 14th day after SAH. Preoperatively, 17 patients were Hunt and Hess Grade I, 9 were Grade II, 28 were Grade III, and 2 were Grade IV. In this group of 56 patients at risk for delayed ischemia from vasospasm, 5 patients had significant intraoperative complications. Ten patients (18%) had delayed cerebral ischemia, totally reversible in 6 cases, with small infarcts in 3 cases, and with 1 death (2% mortality from delayed ischemia), there were 5 cases of shunted hydrocephalus, and 3 deaths from other complications. Overall, 41 patients (73%) returned to their premorbid occupations without neurological deficit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3565313": "For two decades, from 1964 to 1984, 309 patients suffering from choroidal melanoma were treated with 106Ru/106Rh applications, following confirmation of diagnosis by a variety of tests. A total of 216 patients (69.9%) were treated successfully and have been under observation for a mean period of 6.7 years after irradiation. 188 patients were followed for more than five years. Results indicate that enucleation for choroidal melanoma, especially in cases of eyes with good vision, may no longer be the standard treatment for this disease. This appears particularly true inasmuch as almost 50% of all patients with large choroidal melanomas who have enucleation die from metastases within 5 years of the operation. Therefore, conservative methods such as photocoagulation, irradiation, and microsurgical excision have been used with more or less success to destroy tumor and save a functioning eye.", "PMC1201152": "Human growth hormone (HGH) response to i.v. insulin (0.1 U/kg body weight) and arginine infusion (25 g of L-arginine for 30 min) was studied in 9 patients (5 males and 4 females) with primary familial hypercholesterolaemia and belonging to 4 families. Mean age was 28 +/- 2 years (range 18-36) and body weight was less than 105% of ideal body weight. Glucose tolerance and insulin response to oral glucose were normal in all patients. HGH release after insulin and after arginine was slightly increased as compared to 21 normal controls, but the differences were not significant. Insulin and glucagon response to arginine in these patients was within the normal range. Plasma glucose and free fatty acids were normal after both insulin and arginine. Moreover, no significant correlation was found between fasting cholesterol and HGH peaks after insulin and after arginine, nor between cholesterol and insulin and glucagon responses. Despite marked hyperlipidaemia, HGH-deficient patients examined by other authors never present signs of atherosclerotic disease. Our data suggest that HGH, in the presence of elevated cholesterol levels, might play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions.", "PMC3207151": "A group of six patients had the radial keratotomy (RK) procedure carried out on one eye only as part of the Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy (PERK) study. Contrast sensitivity was measured in the operated and unoperated eyes of these patients under conditions of maximum correction and no over-correction. Analysis of variance indicated a significant reduction in the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) of the operated eye postsurgically when compared to the operated eye for all patients. Analysis of results for individual patients indicated that three of the six patients showed significant reductions in CSF between the two eyes. Reasons for these changes are offered in terms of the change in glare produced by the surgical procedure and the difference in spherical aberration of the eye.", "PMC4004254": "A combination of enzyme kinetic studies and active enzyme gel chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B was used to explore conformational changes of the enzyme urease as it catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea in 0.7 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 20 degrees C. It is shown that elucidation of this system is only possible by studying the effects of inert space-filling macromolecules (ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin) on enzymatic behavior. The resulting increases in reaction velocity are interpreted in terms of composition-dependent activity coefficients assessed on a statistical mechanical basis of excluded volume. The results are first considered in terms of two extreme models; one involving a volume change on the isomerization of the enzyme-substrate complex to its activated state, and the other an isomeric expansion of the enzyme-substrate complex to an inactive form. Although both extreme models provide satisfactory descriptions of the kinetic results, they lead to unrealistic values for the radii of the various states of the enzyme-substrate complex. It is concluded, therefore, that the two isomeric transitions act conjointly, a result in conformity with the previously postulated conformational change associated with formation of the activated enzyme-substrate complex [L. W. Nichol, M. J. Sculley, L. D. Ward, and D. J. Winzor (1983) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 222, 574-581], and also with the well-established action of the substrate, urea, as an unfolding agent of proteins.", "PMC3731570": "The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) technique was used to characterize inflammatory cells in the lower respiratory tract of seven nonsmoking patients with CREST syndrome and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Differential cell counts in the BAL fluid showed a significant increase of neutrophils (p less than 0.05) and eosinophils (p less than 0.01) in comparison to normal subjects. In three patients there was also an increase of lymphocytes. No correlation was found between BAL and duration of scleroderma and/or lung function tests. The BAL findings in these scleroderma patients resemble those of idiopathic interstitial fibrosis suggesting that a similar inflammatory process occurs within the lower respiratory tract.", "PMC3173086": "A new technique for the management of the painful neuroma following ray amputation of the index finger is reported. The rationale behind this operative procedure, which is based on both clinical and experimental work, is outlined. The patients' follow-up to 4 years postoperatively is presented.", "PMC3316889": "The effect of chronic selective D-1 and/or D-2 dopamine receptor blockade on regional D-1 receptor binding was studied in rat brain following chronic treatment with the specific D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 and/or the predominantly D-2 antagonist haloperidol. D-1 receptor density and affinity were evaluated by quantitative autoradiography using 125I-SCH 23982. Chronic SCH 23390 treatment increased D-1 receptor density by 30 to 40% in the striatum, accumbens and tuberculum olfactorium; receptor affinity remained unchanged. Haloperidol had no effect on D-1 receptor Bmax or Kd values, although, when administered with SCH 23390, reduced the D-1 receptor upregulation induced by the D-1 antagonist in striatum and tuberculum olfactorium, but not in nucleus accumbens. These results may be attributable to D-1/D-2 dopamine receptor interactions occurring in the striatum and tuberculum olfactorium and may have implications for the prevention and treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders.", "PMC3469422": "The effect of cefmenoxime (CMX) was evaluated in the abdominal surgery at 18 hospitals on the prevention and the treatment of postoperative infections. The results were summarized as follows. In 179 patients with prophylactic use of 2-4 g of CMX a day, no postoperative infection was observed in 94.4%. Using fever index to judge the effect of CMX in prevention of postoperative infections, the value of fever index was higher in the infected group than in the non-infected group. A significant difference was also observed in mean fever index value between the groups given CMX in 2 g and 4 g daily, being 15.4 degree hours and 1.7 degree hours. The incidence of postoperative infections was higher in cases with intraoperative bleeding of more than 500 ml than in cases with less bleeding. Postoperative infection and peritonitis subsided after the administration of 2-4 g of CMX/day for more than 8 days in 77.1% of cases. Very few side effects were noted due to CMX. These results suggest that CMX is safe and effective in the field of abdominal surgery for the prevention of postoperative infections and in the treatment of postoperative infections.", "PMC2257980": "Thoracic sensory neurons in bullfrog tadpoles can be induced to form connections typical of brachial sensory neurons by transplanting thoracic ganglia to the branchial level at stages when some thoracic sensory neurons already have formed connections. In order to find out how many postmitotic sensory neurons survive transplantation, [3H]thymidine was administered to tadpoles in which thoracic ganglia were transplanted to the brachial level unilaterally at stages VII to IX. Between 16 and 37% of the neurons in transplanted ganglia were unlabeled, as compared to 46 to 60% in unoperated ganglia. Transplanted ganglia contained fewer unlabeled neurons than corresponding unoperated ganglia, indicating that transplantation caused degeneration of postmitotic neurons. Therefore, a large fraction of the neurons that formed connections typical of brachial sensory neurons probably differentiated while they were at the brachial level.", "PMC3950489": "A rare case of fatal Weber-Christian disease is reported. The initial presenting signs were unilateral nasal obstruction due to hyperplasia of the ulcerated turbinate, swollen cheeks and eyelids accompanied by recurrent febrile episodes. The nasal lesion showed marked inflammatory granulation tissue with necrosis and there were 'atypical' reticulohistiocytic cells. Subsequently the patient developed widespread nodular nonsuppurative panniculitis of the left thigh. The patient's general condition worsened in spite of cytotoxic and steroid treatment and he died of acute peritonitis from a perforated duodenal ulcer complicating the treatment. Microscopy showed that some atypical cells were present not only in the nasal lesion but also in the lesions of the skin and in the sinusoids of the liver and in the spleen. Weber-Christian disease secondary to midline granuloma or malignant histiocytosis has not previously been reported.", "PMC1079890": "In patients who had died due to various diseases and also in practically healthy individuals aged from 10 to 79 years calcinosis of the coronary arteries was studied morphometrically and histologically. The incidence and the extend of calcinosis implicating the coronary arteries increased with growing age and were more pronounced in males than in females. In analysis of observations uncovered, irrespective of the cause responsible for death, a direct relationship between the area of calcinosis and that of atherosclerosis in grosso modo (correlation factor of 0.46) was noted; the diseased in consequence of diverse affections demonstrated considerable variations in the development of arterial calcinosis. More often than not calcinosis of the coronary arteries was definable in atherosclerotic plaques carrying an important fibrotic component, in cases of necrosis and in those marked by a low lipids content and poor vasculalarization of an altered wall of the coronary artery. Calcinosis of the coronary arteries occurred more often than did their stenosis on 50% or more of the lumen. There has been established a direct relation between the frequency of the coronary artery stenosis and the area of calcinosis. The latter usually appears as a sign of disseminated atherosclerosis rather than as that of a progressive atherosclerotic process.", "PMC3042905": "The primary purpose of formal risk assessment in obstetrics is the prevention and consequent reduction of perinatal morbidity and mortality through early identification and intervention. Obstetric risk scoring quantifies identified risk factors according to their relative contribution to adverse perinatal outcomes and aggregates individual factor scores. A review of existing scoring methods reveals consistently low positive predictive values and more accurate prediction when the assessment occurs closer to the time of actual delivery. While numerous scoring systems exist in the literature, few are convenient in practice, and none appear to assess effectively the dynamic character of pregnancy.", "PMC3251506": "All-night electroencephalogram measures were evaluated against computed tomography scan measures, negative symptoms, and premorbid personality assessment in ten drug-free male schizophrenic patients. Computed tomography scan measures included ventricle brain ratio, cortical atrophy, and width of the third ventricle. Decreased stage-4 sleep was associated with enlarged VBR, poor premorbid functioning, and negative symptoms. Size of the VBR accounted for 58.5% of the variance in stage-4 sleep. Brain atrophy was associated with longer sleep latency but with less arousals once the patients were asleep. Rapid-eye-movement measures did not correlate significantly with any of the variables examined. Our data suggest that decreased slow-wave sleep and ventricle size are associated in schizophrenia.", "PMC4905667": "Purification of DNA polymerase from E. coli B has in two cases each time led to the isolation of two separate polymerase activities, enzyme A and enzyme B. Enzyme A was in contrast to enzyme B almost completely devoid of exonuclease activity. Each of the two enzymes yielded a single symmetrical activity peak in gel filtration chromatograms. From the elution volumes the molecular weights were estimated to be about 70,000 for enzyme A and about 150,000 for enzyme B. Treatment of enzyme B with subtilisin led to an increase of about 30 per cent of the polymerase activity while the exonuclease activity almost completely disappeared. The product of the subtilisin treatment (enzyme C) gave rise to a single symmetrical polymerase activity peak in a gel filtration chromatogram. The elution volume was identical to that obtained with enzyme A. It is concluded that enzyme A and enzyme C are formed by limited proteolysis of enzyme B.", "PMC3046446": "Three hundred fifty-one alert emergency department patients with post-traumatic neck pain were evaluated prospectively. Seven (2%) had proven fractures or ligament disruptions. The immediate onset of neck pain and the presence of posterior midline cervical tenderness each had 100% sensitivity, with specificity of 65% and 48%, respectively. Discharged patients were followed up by telephone or letter at a mean of 25 +/- 20 weeks. Of this group, 63% saw another physician, and 43% had persistent moderate-to-severe neck pain or neurologic symptoms at a mean follow-up time of 24 weeks after injury. Of those who had not had a cervical radiograph while in the ED, 52% later obtained one. In addition, 66% of the discharged patients were pursuing litigation. The results suggest that it may be possible to identify alert patients with cervical spine injury by means of history and examination only; however, a larger study confirming these results is required. The high frequency of post-ED radiography, the high prevalence of persistent symptoms after injury, and frequent involvement in litigation are factors to be considered when evaluating ED patients with post-traumatic neck pain. These factors may support the validity of obtaining cervical spine radiographs on many more of these patients than high-yield criteria would dictate.", "PMC3141381": "The synthesis of glycine betaine, a powerful osmoprotectant, from its precursor, choline, is a function of the bet genes. The bet genes code for the high-affinity transport of choline and the enzymes for its conversion to glycine betaine. These genes map at 7.5 min on the E. coli chromosome and are contained on the conjugative plasmid F'2. To study the transcriptional regulation of the bet genes in response to various environmental conditions, a collection of 30 lac operon fusions was isolated by utilizing the bet genes contained on F'2. Four osmoregulated bet loci (betA, betB, betC, and betT) were identified based on biochemical, regulatory, and merodiploid analysis of these fusions. All of the bet fusions demonstrated a 7- to 10-fold increase in transcription in response to increases in the osmotic strength of the growth medium. Choline further induced expression of lac fusions at the betA, betB, and betT loci when the cells were grown under conditions of osmotic stress. The end product of the pathway, glycine betaine, was a corepressor of choline induction for fusions at the betA and betT loci. Expression of the betA, betB, and betT loci was reduced 7- to 10-fold under anaerobic conditions. In addition, expression of the betB and betT loci was reduced when the cells were grown in high osmolarity at 16 degrees C. These studies demonstrate that the expression of the bet genes is under the control of several environmental stimuli.", "PMC3514729": "The short- and long-term effects of two calcium channel blocking drugs, verapamil and nifedipine, on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines, plasma renin activity, plasma volume and cardiac performance (echocardiography) were studied in essential hypertensive patients and in normal subjects. Verapamil, 160 mg orally, reduced blood pressure within 60 minutes in 22 hypertensive patients, but not in 12 normotensive subjects. Nifedipine, 10 mg sublingually, reduced blood pressure within 15 minutes in 19 hypertensive patients, but not in 7 normotensive subjects. Plasma noradrenaline was significantly increased both in normal subjects and in hypertensive patients only after nifedipine was administered. Verapamil (80 mg three times a day) first, and nifedipine (10 mg three times a day) thereafter, or vice versa, were given to 12 hospitalized hypertensive patients on a fixed sodium and potassium intake; the drugs produced similar blood pressure reductions, but heart rate and plasma catecholamines were increased only after nifedipine (p less than 0.05). Neither drug affected plasma volume, aldosterone or plasma renin activity. Long-term ambulatory treatment with verapamil (80 or 160 mg three times a day for 2 to 4 months) or nifedipine (10 mg three times a day for 2 months) produced changes in all variables that were similar to those observed in the hospital (controlled) study. Shortening fraction was significantly increased after nifedipine (p less than 0.05) but no change was observed after verapamil. In conclusion, blood pressure is effectively reduced by both verapamil and nifedipine; an appreciable adrenergic stimulation may be caused by nifedipine, but usually not by verapamil, and fluid retention, renin release or myocardial depression is not observed during verapamil or nifedipine treatment.", "PMC4050723": "We developed a test procedure for the clinical evaluation of the absorption of vitamin D. Serum vitamin D concentrations were evaluated in seven patients with intestinal fat malabsorption syndromes and in seven healthy, normal subjects, after being given a single oral dose of 50,000 IU (1.25 mg) vitamin D2. In the normal subjects, serum vitamin D concentrations rose from a baseline of less than 5 ng/ml to a peak of over 50 ng/ml by 12 h, gradually falling to baseline levels by 3 days. In five of the seven patients with intestinal fat malabsorption, oral administration of 50,000 IU vitamin D2 did not raise serum vitamin D concentrations above 10 ng/ml. Two patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease had a normal absorption pattern, however. These findings suggest that an oral vitamin D absorption test may be of value for determination of patients at risk for development of vitamin D deficiency. They also raise questions about the efficacy of oral vitamin D preparations in patients with intestinal fat malabsorption.", "PMC1325204": "Agrobacterium-transformed Arabidopsis plants were generated and the stability of their T-DNA-encoded resistance to kanamycin was examined. Of seven families, each homozygous for a single insertion event, two showed progressive inactivation of resistance over four generations of inbreeding. Loss of resistance was associated with methylation of an Sst II site in the nos promoter of the kanamycin resistance gene. Treatment of plant roots from inactive lines with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine restored the ability of such lines to form callus on kanamycin-containing media. These observations are consistent with the view that methylation is a factor in the progressive inactivation of transgenes in Arabidopsis.", "PMC3978159": "In hepatocytes isolated from 48-hour-old suckling pigs, the inhibition of endogenous fatty acid oxidation leads to a 30% inhibition of glucose production from lactate. Addition of oleate plus carnitine to hepatocytes from 48-hour-old fasting pigs increases by 30% the rate of gluconeogenesis from lactate. In hepatocytes isolated from fasting newborn pigs, addition of glucagon (0.5 ng/ml) produces a 30% increase in the rate of glucose production from lactate and a 70% increase of glucose synthesis from dihydroxyacetone. The high rate of lactate plus pyruvate production in fasting piglets is markedly suppressed by glucagon and return to the value measured in suckling newborns. Combined addition of oleate and glucagon to hepatocytes from fasting piglets increases by 2-fold the rate of glucose production from lactate but does not restore totally the rate of glucose synthesis found in suckling piglets. It is concluded that fatty acid oxidation and hormonal environment contribute significantly to the development of an active gluconeogenesis in the newborn pig but do not represent the sole factors involved in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.", "PMC2815779": "A report on 100 consecutive esophagoenteric anastomoses (EEA stapler) following total (esophagojejunostomy) or proximal gastrectomy (esophagogastrostomy) is presented. The following intraoperative problems occurred: insufficiency of the purse string suture [4], lumen of the esophagus too small [1], rupture of the esophageal wall [4], incomplete rings [4]. Fatal postoperative complications included two cases of insufficiency of the esophagojejunostomy, whilst the remaining six postoperative deaths were not linked to the use of the stapler (operative mortality 8%). Follow-up showed no recurrence at the stapler line, but two anastomotic strictures occurred. The EEA stapler is a helpful instrument to reduce leakage at the esophagoenteric anastomosis and, hence operative mortality after total and proximal gastrectomy.", "PMC2213140": "Antibodies to small cardioactive peptide (SCP) label a segmentally iterated subset of cells in the leech nerve cord, including the previously identified alternating SCP (AS) neurons. Unlike the majority of leech neurons, these cells are asymmetrically distributed in the adult nerve cord. Moreover, each AS neuron shows a strong tendency to lie on alternate right and left sides in successive ganglia. Previous work has shown that these unpaired neurons arise from bilaterally paired embryonic homologues, only 1 of which takes on the mature immunoreactive phenotype. The 2 AS homologues within a ganglion compete for this fate, in that either the right or the left homologue will become a mature AS neuron with a high degree of reliability if its contralateral homologue is ablated during embryogenesis. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of interactions between neurons in adjacent ganglia that could account for the alternation of sides observed during normal development. The unilateral ablation of a single AS homologue neuron forced its contralateral homologue to take on the mature AS fate, and this consistently biased the side of AS development in adjacent, unlesioned ganglia both anterior and posterior to the lesion. One of the AS neurons, the caudal alternating SCP (CAS) cell, was injected with Lucifer yellow in adult nerve cords and was shown to have a large primary axon that extends into more anterior ganglia, as well as other, finer axons that are variable in number and arrangement. If the interganglionic interaction of AS neuron homologues is mediated by their primary axons, signals of developmental import must be transmitted both anterogradely and retrogradely along the axon's length. The present results indicate that the development of individual AS neurons is influenced by homologous cells located in the same and neighboring ganglia and suggest that the final, multisegmental patterning of the AS neuron distribution is not predetermined, but rather, arises as an emergent property of the cell interactions that occur during nervous system differentiation.", "PMC3213331": "The function of the sympathetic-adrenal system was studied by measuring umbilical cord blood catecholamines in 31 full-term newborns with perinatal asphyxia and evidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and in 20 normal newborns. The results indicate that the full-term newborn responds to asphyxia with graded catecholamine release. The epinephrine concentration in newborns with moderate HIE is lower than in newborns with mild HIE, which may reflect decreased sympathetic-adrenal function due to prolonged asphyxia. Acid-base values in capillary blood and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid were determined in the babies with HIE, with the findings pointing to metabolic acidosis which was more expressed in cerebrospinal fluid.", "PMC3487377": "A new method for maintaining the isolated frog optic tectum superfused in vitro at a low temperature is described. The preparation remains viable for several hours with electrophysiological responses similar to those of the in vivo tectum. This superfusion technique will allow controlled application of putative neurotransmitters and other substances in known concentrations and therefore makes the in vitro frog optic tectum a useful model system for neuropharmacological investigations into central optic pathways.", "PMC2631114": "In this experiment, the \"nu\" gene was introduced into \"beige\" mutant mice, which are immunodeficient in NK cell activity. The resultant beige nude mice (bg/bg-nu/nu) have combined immunodeficiency in both T and NK cell activities. The level of NK cell activity in beige nude mice is slightly higher than that in beige mice, but much lower than that in nude mice. This is consistent with other studies. In order to elucidate the role of the metastatic behavior of a human tumor cell line PAa in both athymic nude mice and beige nude mice. The PAa cell line was originally established from a human lung adenocarcinoma and maintained as a solid tumor by serial s.c. passage in nude mice. During the first 18 passages in nude mice, PAa cells were found to have metastasized spontaneously to regional lymph nodes in only 4 animals, but metastases were no longer found in subsequent passages. The total incidence of metastasis in nude mice was 9% (4/44). However, when inoculated s.c. into beige nude mice, the metastatic rate of PAa cells was 43% (9/21) to the regional lymph nodes and 10% (2/21) to the lungs in two separate experiments. We conclude from the results that NK cells may play an important, if not exclusive, role in host resistance to tumor metastasis. Beige nude mice could serve as a useful in vivo model in studies of the biology and heterogeneity of human tumor metastasis.", "PMC3833828": "In a small town and its adjacent villages of the Hessian Neckar Valley, Federal Republic of Germany, 155 of the officially registered domestic dogs were examined for intestinal helminths. Twenty percent of the animals proved to be infected. The highest prevalence of 5.8% could be attributed to infections with Toxocara canis. These values are well below the average rates for dogs in the larger German cities.", "PMC3335792": "Concentration profiles for the major biological inorganic elements Na, P, S, Cl, and K were measured across human skin using electron probe analysis and analytical electron microscopy. Determinations were made within the cytoplasm of individual cells. Uniform element concentrations were present throughout the viable tissue, whereas element profiles in the stratum corneum were considerably diverse. Phosphorus was practically absent from the stratum corneum. Sulfur (per unit volume) continuously increased from the inner to the outer cell layers of the stratum corneum largely as a result of cytoplasmic water loss as cells migrate to the surface. Potassium was essentially excluded from the inner stratum corneum. Very large gradients for K, Na, and Cl occurred from the middle of the stratum corneum to its outer surface; these gradients are likely the result of the inward diffusion of salts from sweat and could play a variety of physiological roles. The paucity of K and P within the inner stratum corneum suggests these important intracellular solutes (and perhaps others, including water) are recycled within the viable tissue, thus providing a virtual nutrient supply immediately underneath the stratum corneum. Alterations in this recirculation could have a regulatory function in the physiology of this tissue.", "PMC1847436": "In this work we used brefeldin A (BFA), a specific inhibitor of export to the Golgi apparatus, to study pseudorabies virus viral glycoprotein processing and virus egress. BFA had little effect on initial synthesis and cotranslational modification of viral glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but it disrupted subsequent glycoprotein maturation and export. Additionally, single-step growth experiments demonstrated that after the addition of BFA, accumulation of infectious virus stopped abruptly. BFA interruption of virus egress was reversible. Electron microscopic analysis of infected cells demonstrated BFA-induced disappearance of the Golgi apparatus accompanied by a dramatic accumulation of enveloped virions between the inner and outer nuclear membranes and also in the ER. Large numbers of envelope-free capsids were also present in the cytoplasm of all samples. In control samples, these capsids were preferentially associated with the forming face of Golgi bodies and acquired a membrane envelope derived from the trans-cisternae. Our results are consistent with a multistep pathway for envelopment of pseudorabies virus that involves initial acquisition of a membrane by budding of capsids through the inner leaf of the nuclear envelope followed by deenvelopment and release of these capsids from the ER into the cytoplasm in proximity to the trans-Golgi. The released capsids then acquire a bilaminar double envelope containing mature viral glycoproteins at the trans-Golgi. The resulting double-membraned virus is transported to the plasma membrane, where membrane fusion releases a mature, enveloped virus particle from the cell.", "PMC3432468": "A considerable amount of research documents the negative effects of job loss on both physical and mental health. Yet we know comparatively little about the mechanisms through which these effects occur. Unemployment, like other events, is not the same experience for everyone exposed to it. An understanding of this variation might be facilitated by breaking down the analysis of unemployment into a consideration of the various stresses that it creates or exacerbates. This is our purpose in the present paper. We demonstrate that, for one area of the United States, the effect of job loss on several health outcomes involves two mechanisms: (1) unemployment results in increased financial strain which, in turn, results in negative health effects, and (2) unemployment leaves the individual more vulnerable to the impact of unrelated life events. Controlling for financial strain, unemployed people in our sample who have not experienced an additional life event in the previous year are in no worse health than the stably employed. This provides useful insights into the nature of the unemployment experience in this particular setting. It also provides a basis for future detailed explorations of the various ways people cope with this event.", "PMC3608664": "Recent reports have suggested that day-care experience initiated prior to 12 months of age is associated with increased proportions of infants whose attachment to mother is classified as \"insecure-avoidant.\" However, reviewers have questioned the generality of these findings, noting that samples in which associations between early day-care experience and avoidant attachment patterns have been reported come from high-risk populations, and/or that the infants' day-care settings may not have been of high quality. In the present study, effects of maternal absences on infant-mother attachment quality were assessed in a low-risk, middle-class sample (N = 110). In all instances, substitute care had been initiated at least 4 months prior to the infant's first birthday and was provided in the infant's home by a person unrelated to the baby. Infants were assessed using the Ainsworth Strange Situation when they were 12-13 months of age. Analyses indicated that a significantly greater proportion of infants whose mothers worked outside the home (N = 54) were assigned to the category \"insecure-avoidant\" as compared to infants whose mothers remained in the home (N = 56) throughout the first year of life. Analyses of demographic and psychological data available for the sample indicated that this relation is dependent upon maternal parity (primi- vs. multiparous mother). The association between attachment quality and work status was significant only for firstborn children of full-time working mothers. The results are interpreted as evidence that the repeated daily separations experienced by infants whose mothers are working full-time constitute a \"risk\" factor for the development of \"insecure-avoidant\" infant-mother attachments.", "PMC2185538": "Stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine are among the most commonly abused substances by schizophrenic patients. This may be due in part to aspects of the illness and treatment side effects that impel patients to use dopamine agonist drugs. Dopaminergic neural systems have been shown to mediate both stimulant drug effects and schizophrenia. Because of the hypothesized overlap in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the neurobiological effects of chronic stimulant use, the potential for serious complication of the primary disease by substance abuse exists. This article reviews the neurobiological mechanisms of behavioral sensitization and neurotoxicity associated with chronic stimulant administration in the context of pathophysiological theories of schizophrenia. Discussion focuses on the potential impact of stimulant use on the disease process as well as the manifest phenomenology and course of schizophrenia.", "PMC2228380": "Of 3,079 children in a medium-sized community near Jerusalem, 11.2% were found to be infested with living lice and eggs and another 23.4% had only nits. Boys and girls were equally infested. The incidence of infestation was highest among children 4-11 years of age. About 78% of the infested children had from one to ten lice. Approximately 80% of the infested children had nits that were 2-5 cm away from the scalp. Boys with medium length hair and girls with short hair showed the highest incidence of lice infestation.

At comparatively larger numbers of eggs (500 and 2500) the survival rate has been highest at the 3- and 4-month-old chickens, and the morphologic changes in this age group are most pronouncedly expressed. Investigations have shown that the greatest survival rate corresponds to the weakest increase in the leukocyte count and the amount of the gamma-globulins in the 3- and 4-month-old chickens. In the one- and 2-month-old ones the Heterakis infection has caused a strong increase in the leukocyte count, and in those aged 5-7 month-old there has been also an increase in the gamma-globulins. The biochemical indices and the morphologic changes have not in all cases been directly dependent on the age of the infected birds, the number of the infective eggs given, and the number of the Heterakis helminths that have survived. Heterakis injection caused by a greater number of eggs is present by worms of a smaller size. Chickens infected at the age of more than five months have worms among which the female samples are considerably more than the male ones as compared with the respective numbers found in one- to 4-month-old birds.", "PMC3458534": "DNA sequences and protein factors directing termination of mouse rDNA transcription in a nuclear extract system were examined. Termination is specific and requires a sequence element AGGTCGACCAGATTANTCCG (the Sall box) that is present eight times in the spacer region downstream of the 3' end of pre-rRNA. Exonuclease III protection experiments reveal the binding of a nuclear protein to the Sall box. Deletions, insertions, and point mutations in the Sall box reduce or abolish the interaction with the nuclear factor and disrupt transcription termination. A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the Sall box consensus sequence governs transcription termination in vitro, although with reduced activity. Therefore, other sequences normally surrounding the Sall box appear to contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of termination.", "PMC2893456": "The 18-kd hydrophobic pulmonary surfactant protein (PSP-B) is a developmentally regulated protein which is important for normal lung function.

Southern blot hybridization to genomic DNA isolated from a panel of human-CHO somatic cell hybrids unambiguously maps this gene to chromosome 2. Human DNA cut with BamHI yields a RFLP with variable bands at 2.8 and 2.6 kb.

Tris buffer at pH 7.0 and 8.0 and at 35 degrees C significantly protected isolate OP2 from autolysis and failed to do so with isolate OP7.

Group III--twice yearly topical application of acidulated phosphate fluoride solution with prior toothbrushing with a non-fluoridated prophy paste. After 18 months analysis of 160 children in each study group led to the following conclusions: 1. Acidulated phosphate fluoride topical applications are effective in the prevention of dental caries. 2.

Like bepridil, both TFP and W7 reduced the severity of arrhythmias evoked by 30 min of coronary artery occlusion in the anaesthetized rat. TFP (2.5-10 mg kg-1, i.v.), W7 (2.5-10 mg kg-1, i.v.) and bepridil (1-5 mg kg-1, i.v.) also antagonized the development of ventricular fibrillation induced by 5 min of occlusion followed by reperfusion. All three drugs also reduced mortality. TFP and bepridil also reduced the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular tachycardia whilst all 3 drugs reduced its duration. Although TFP was shown to possess alpha-adrenoceptor blocking properties, the classical alpha-blocker, phentolamine, failed to reduce significantly the incidence or severity of reperfusion arrhythmias. In contrast to bepridil (2-20 microM), which markedly reduced the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) of guinea-pig isolated papillary muscle, W7(5-50 microM) showed only weak effects on Vmax and was at least 10 times less potent than bepridil whilst TFP only reduced Vmax in high concentrations (40-100 microM) which lowered resting membrane potential. Unlike bepridil, neither TFP (4-40 microM) nor W7 prolonged the absolute refractory period. The results suggest that drugs which inhibit calmodulin confer protection against both ischaemia-and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in the rat. Although the electrophysiological actions of bepridil would adequately account for its antiarrhythmic activity, the same cannot be said of W7 and especially TFP. In conclusion, calmodulin antagonism may constitute a mechanism of antiarrhythmic activity.", "PMC3594739": "The effects of increased dietary cholesterol content on coronary vascular hemodynamics and endothelial cell transport function were assessed in isolated rabbit hearts during 3.5 hours of reperfusion after 30 minutes of global, no-flow ischemia. In control hearts from rabbits fed normal chow, perfusion pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, maximum +dP/dt, and the rate of intravascular clearance of radiolabelled albumin remained constant during 5 hours of continuous perfusion, while the mean transit time of radiolabelled albumin increased 1.6 X baseline. In ischemic hearts from rabbits fed normal chow, perfusion pressure increased 59% during reperfusion while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and maximum +dP/dt returned toward control levels. The rate of intravascular clearance of radiolabelled albumin decreased 36%, and the mean transit time of albumin increased approximately 3 X baseline. Ischemia-reperfusion injury to the cardiac vasculature and musculature was markedly increased in hearts of rabbits fed chow supplemented with 2% cholesterol for 2-3 weeks compared to rabbits fed the same diet for a longer duration (5-16 weeks) or rabbits fed normal chow. Prior to ischemia, permeation of the coronary vasculature by albumin was increased twofold in rabbits fed cholesterol for 2-3 weeks while myocyte contractile function was normal relative to chow-fed controls or the group fed cholesterol for 5-16 weeks.

In such cells, segregation occurred later, at the end of the division cycle rather than at the end of deoxyribonucleic acid replication. Nuclear regions in L-broth cells (22-min doubling time) cannot correspond to separate chromosomes but probably represent regions of replication activity.

Systems homologous to Ly-5 are known in rats and in humans. The complete exon-intron organization of the Ly-5 gene is described in this report. The Ly-5 gene occupies about 120 kilobases of chromosome 1 and comprises 34 exons, of which 32 (Ex-3 to Ex-34) are protein coding. Ex-1, Ex-2, and parts of Ex-3 and Ex-34 are untranslated. In all cDNA clones examined, either Ex-1 or Ex-2 was represented, but not both, implying that Ex-1 and Ex-2 in Ly-5 mRNA may be mutually exclusive. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection mapping were used to identify initiation (cap) sites for transcription. The finding of putative cap sites for Ex-1 and Ex-2, and of corresponding TATA-like sequences, suggests the presence of two promoters. In both Ex-1+ and Ex-2+ cDNA clones the next exon is Ex-3, which has a translation-initiating codon. The intron between Ex-3 and Ex-4 is unusually long, about 50 kilobases. Evidence is given that Ex-5, like Ex-6 and Ex-7 (studied previously), is another alternative exon that is selectively programmed, alone or together with Ex-6 or Ex-7 or both, to generate actual or potential Ly-5 isoforms by alternative splicing.", "PMC2171942": "High-density lipoproteins are thought to play an important role in the initial steps of reverse cholesterol transport in which cholesterol is removed from peripheral tissues to the liver for ultimate excretion. Since the cell types involved have been shown to possess high-affinity binding sites for HDL, it has been of considerable interest to find out whether or not these bindings sites are also involved in efflux of cholesterol from cells. Studies conducted in several laboratories have consistently shown that the binding site does not promote or enhance efflux of cholesterol from cellular plasma membrane. Binding of HDL to its cell surface binding site does, however, appear to promote efflux of cholesterol from intracellular compartments. The activity of the HDL binding sites has also been shown to be metabolically regulated in response to changes in the growth state and cholesterol homeostasis of the cell. It is therefore apparent that the binding sites are involved in a physiologically regulated process of cholesterol removal from cells, as part of reverse cholesterol transport.", "PMC3277501": "Langerhans' cells are a defined subpopulation of the mononuclear phagocyte system known to accumulate in the lung in histiocytosis X, an interstitial lung disorder strongly linked to cigarette smoking. To evaluate the hypothesis that cigarette smoking itself may be associated with the accumulation of Langerhans' cells in the lung, normal nonsmokers (n = 5) and normal smokers (n = 10) were evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage for the presence of Langerhans' cells as identified by the OKT6 monoclonal antibody and by transmission electron microscopy. While the OKT6 antibody identified 0.1 +/- 0.1% of the cells recovered from nonsmokers, it labeled 1.1 +/- 0.3% of those recovered from smokers (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, while electron microscopy demonstrated no Langerhans' cells among the lavage cells from nonsmokers, 0.4 +/- 0.1% of the cells recovered from normal smokers contained characteristic intracytoplasmic Birbeck granules, positively identifying them as Langerhans' cells. We conclude that cigarette smoking is associated with an expansion in the population of Langerhans' cells on the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract. While the mechanisms underlying this accumulation are unknown, it is possible that the properties of these cells contribute to the derangements of the pulmonary parenchyma found in cigarette smoking and establish a biologic link to the already observed epidemiologic association between histiocytosis X and cigarette smoking.", "PMC2882935": "Intracellular recordings were made from a selection of identified neurons in the sub-oesophageal ganglia of Helix aspersa, and their responses to the molluscan neuropeptides FMRF-amide and pQDPFLRF-amide compared. While FMRF-amide excited certain neurons and inhibited others, pQDPFLRF-amide did not produce excitation in any of the cells tested. A few cells were unresponsive to pQDPFLRF-amide, but most were inhibited with varying potency. FMRF-amide was generally 10-100 times more potent than pQDPFLRF-amide, but one cell, E13 in the visceral ganglion, showed equal sensitivity to the two peptides.

All those values were shown to significantly differ with individual patients.

Two-arm cranking and one-leg cycling were found to be 55 and 66 per cent of two-leg VO2 max, respectively. The % VO2 max at which the anaerobic threshold occurred during the two-arm and one-leg exercise conditions were 57 and 68 per cent, respectively.

The GOT was elevated in 45% GPT in 37.5% and lactate dehydrogenase in 56% of all cases. The enzyme elevation did not correlate with the degree of liver involvement.

But the virulent Mahoney strain caused flaccid paralysis in two of three monkeys. In these two paralyzed monkeys, definite specific histological changes were observed with spreading of the lesions to places far from the inoculation site, i.e., the cervical cord and brain.

Although sepsis presents in many forms clinically, most clinicians would probably agree that virtually all severely septic patients manifest respiratory failure and ventilator dependence. Furthermore, failure of organs other than the lungs typically occurs days to weeks after the onset of the septic process. Although early deaths occur commonly in some situations (e.g., meningococcemia, pneumococcal bacteremia in asplenic individuals, Gram-negative bacteremia in the setting of profound granulocytopenia), most deaths due to sepsis occur after a protracted course in an intensive care unit. Thus, for certain important experiments, there is a need for an animal model of severe chronic sepsis characterized by these features: persistent hypermetabolism, low systemic vascular resistance, respiratory failure severe enough to require mechanical ventilation, late (nonpulmonary) organ system failure, and death. Obviously, creation of such a model will require a major commitment of resources, because it will require, in essence, the creation of an animal intensive care unit. Nevertheless, we believe that progress in sepsis-related research would be substantially facilitated were such a model available. Even without such a model, progress will continue in this field. A wide variety of good animal models are already available to investigators. In the next decade, as new methods, such as the powerful tools of molecular biology, are applied to problems related to the sepsis syndrome, these models will be invaluable in improving our understanding of pathophysiology and in developing new and more effective approaches toward therapy.", "PMC3877047": "A hamster trachea organ culture system was utilized to evaluate quantitatively the effects of a strain of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) and culture supernatants of the same strain on ciliary activity. Tracheal explants were maintained in organ culture for 96 to 144 h and ciliary activity was observed daily with an inverted microscope. Explants continuously exposed to a strain of NTHI had a progressive decline in ciliary activity which was significantly lower than uninfected controls evaluated concomitantly by 48 h of exposure and thereafter. Histologic studies revealed a progressive degeneration of mucosal cells and exfoliation of ciliated cells. Scanning electron microscopy showed little adherence of NTHI to the mucosal surface. Sterile broth cultures of NTHI and supernatants of organ cultures infected with the same NTHI strain had no adverse effect on ciliary activity. Infected tracheal explants treated with ampicillin 24, 48, or 72 h after continuous bacterial challenge had no significant decline in ciliary activity compared to controls. The lack of adherence and the histologic changes observed when hamster trachea cultures were infected with NTHI suggested a toxin might mediate the damage observed.

Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the role, if any, of a toxin in the production of damage to hamster tracheal explants by NTHI.", "PMC3573020": "The authors compared the attitudes of men and women junior medical students at one medical school before and after completing the surgery clerkship.

The class as a whole had more positive attitudes in all three areas after the clerkship. The men and women did not differ before or after the clerkship in their confidence in handling problems in the doctor-patient relationship. The women, however, had higher levels of concern than the men about preventive care after the clerkship. Although the men and women overall entered the clerkship with similar attitudes, the women left the surgical clerkship with more positive attitudes overall but also with more concerns about future practice than the men.

The yeast-phase cell walls of five strains of H. capsulatum fell into two categories, designated chemotypes I and II, one of which, chemotype II, was similar to yeast-phase cell walls derived from three strains of B. dermatitidis. H. capsulatum chemotype I cell walls were characterized by lower content of material soluble in ethylenediamine, higher chitin content, and lower monosaccharide content than H. capsulatum chemotype II or B. dermatitidis cell walls. Approximately 80% of the monosaccharides of chemotype I cell walls was combined in forms susceptible to attack by mild acid hydrolysis, compared with about 50% of the monosaccharides of chemotype II and B. dermatitidis. H. capsulatum and B. dermatitidis yeast-phase cell walls could be distinguished, however, by their susceptibility to attack by a crude enzyme system derived from a Streptomyces sp. incubated with chitin as the only carbon source. Both glucose and acetylglucosamine were released from H. capsulatum cell walls, regardless of chemotype, during enzymatic hydrolysis, whereas only acetylglucosamine was released from B. dermatitidis yeast-phase cell walls. Mycelial-phase cell walls of H. capsulatum and B. dermatitidis were characterized by lower content of material soluble in ethylenediamine, higher proportions of mannose, and lower chitin content than their respective yeast phases.

The group with good LVF showed large variations in arterial pressure and heart rate between stimulated and unstimulated states with a reasonable preservation of LVF, expressed as stroke volume, through the whole observation period. The group with poor LVF showed monotonously falling arterial pressure, and no heart rate response to tracheal intubation. These patients maintained remarkably stable stroke volumes in connection with low afterloads. After nitrous oxide, additional volume loading was required because of profound hypotension. The majority of the patients in the intermediate group, labelled \"depressed LVF\", reacted to intubation and sternotomy with signs of left ventricular failure in connection with tachycardia and increased afterloads. The individual variations between patients with different degrees of left ventricular impairment were considerable, and these haemodynamic patterns need to be confirmed with a larger material.", "PMC2965744": "Two experiments provide evidence that 4-month-old infants perceive background surfaces as continuous behind occluding objects.

The infants in each study looked longer at the interrupted than at the continuous surface, relative to infants in baseline controls, which suggests that the partly hidden surface was perceived as continuous. Contrasting findings were obtained in a third experiment, in which infants were habituated to a partly hidden surface that stood in front of a background so that its edges were visible: Infants gave no evidence of perceiving the foreground surface as continuous behind the occluder.

Thirty-five patients had cure without relapse over a mean follow-up of 17 months. Six had a relapse of infection but 4 of these had been noncompliant with therapy. Two patients improved initially but ultimately had progression of disease despite maintenance of adequate serum levels. Adverse effects were common but not severe.

The kinase has been purified to apparent homogeneity and migrates as a single band at Mr 70,000 in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. The kinase exhibits the ability to autophosphorylate, and this activity directly parallels S6 phosphorylation activity on the final step of purification. In vitro, the kinase incorporates up to 5 mol of phosphate into S6, and the tryptic phosphopeptide maps obtained are equivalent to those from S6 phosphorylated in vivo. Most important, treatment of the purified kinase with phosphatase 2A results in complete inactivation of the enzyme, arguing that the activity of the kinase is directly controlled by phosphorylation.", "PMC4057083": "The pharmacokinetics of recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) were studied in 20 subjects during and after its i.v. infusion at three different rates (5.6, 8.3, and 10 micrograms/kg/min). Steady-state plasma concentrations of 0.9 to 1.6 micrograms/ml were reached. The plasma disappearance curves of rt-PA (both antigen and activity) after cessation of infusion were approximated by a sum of two exponential terms and the turnover of rt-PA was represented by a two-compartment mammillary model with peripheral (liver) elimination. The fractional efflux rate constant from the central compartment was 0.10 per min and the fractional catabolic rate constant about 0.02 per min. After cessation of infusion the initial half-life of the drug in plasma was 6 min. Fibrinogen levels were measured by a clotting rate assay and by sodium sulfite precipitation. Infusion of rt-PA at 10 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min did not cause systemic fibrinogen breakdown. Infusion of 5.6 micrograms/kg/min for 90 min was associated with a decrease of fibrinogen to 62% of the preinfusion value (4.5 g/l) as measured with the clotting rate assay, but only 2% was recovered as incoagulable fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products. Infusion of 8.3 micrograms/kg/min for 90 min resulted in a decrease of fibrinogen to 45% of the preinfusion level (2.5 g/l) and generation of 8.5% fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products. Fibrinogen assays with the sodium sulfite method showed a much less extensive decrease of fibrinogen. This extent of systemic fibrinolytic activation and fibrinogen breakdown at high infusion rates and prolonged durations is compatible with that anticipated from the kinetic parameters of the activation of plasminogen by rt-PA.", "PMC3070730": "This study describes the distribution of isotypes and idiotypes of two autoantibody populations, anti-La and rheumatoid factor, which co-exist in both the sera and saliva of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome. The two autoantibodies are distinguished not only by their antigenic specificity but also by the nature of their idiotypic markers. IgA anti-La antibodies bearing restricted idiotypes are specifically enriched in saliva compared to serum suggesting their local synthesis. In contrast, rheumatoid factors bear cross-reactive idiotypes and may arise as a direct consequence of the secondary immune response.", "PMC1325099": "Pathogenesis studies in animals can uncover details concerning viral replication, growth, and access to target organs, in vivo. This, in turn, reveals opportunities for antiviral intervention that may be otherwise missed by limiting analysis to growth of virus in tissue culture. In this report, reovirus infection of mice is used as a model. Three general aspects of reovirus behavior in mice are presented and each demonstrates a property of the virus that could easily have been missed by studies in tissue culture.", "PMC1868734": "Although initial studies examining the relationship of oral contraceptives to risk of cervical neoplasia were reassuring, more recent studies provide some evidence of a positive relationship, particularly for long-term usage. Results, however, are difficult to interpret, because of a variety of methodologic complexities, including potential sources of confounding and bias. Sexual behavior and Pap smear screening have been identified as important confounders, but in several well-controlled studies residual excess risks of nearly 2-fold persist for users of 5 or more years. A possible promotional effect of oral contraceptives is suggested by higher risks associated with recent usage. There also is some suggestion of a stronger effect for adenocarcinomas than for squamous cell tumors. A relationship is biologically possible, given findings of hormone receptors in cervical tissue and the fact that oral contraceptives have been found to induce cervical hyperplasia. In addition, oral contraceptives may induce proliferation of the human papillomaviruses, the leading suspect agent for cervical cancer. Although a number of lines of evidence support a relationship of oral contraceptives to cervical cancer risk, firm conclusions await the results of additional studies that specifically address some of the methodologic shortcomings of previous investigations. In particular, additional follow-up studies are needed to define the effect of oral contraceptives on the natural history of cervical lesions.", "PMC3743801": "Fourteen kinds of trace elements were analyzed in the semen of 22 fertile men and 69 infertile men by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Ca had the highest concentration, and the second and third highest concentrations were Zn and Mg, respectively. The concentrations of Ca, Cr, Mg, Pb, Sr, and Zn were almost the same between fertile and infertile men. Ni had a lower concentration in infertile than in fertile men. Many trace elements, such as Al, Cd, Cu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Sn, and Zn, had significantly higher concentrations in infertile men with normozoospermia than in fertile men. There was a significantly positive correlation between Zn and Mg levels in fertile and infertile men.", "PMC3300020": "The data on biological role of numerous phospholipid metabolites, main part of which is localized in cell membranes, are reviewed. Many of these metabolites are related to slowly reacting substances of anaphylaxis and participate in allergic and inflammatory reactions. Conditions of biosynthesis of phospholipid active metabolites are characterized in the reactions of lipid peroxidation, N-acetylation, formation of Shiff bases, enaminales via transacetylation, by the action of phospholipases, lipooxygenase, cyclooxygenase, by formation of plasmalogens, phosphomonolipids, phospholipid diols. Role of individual phospholipid metabolites in normal and pathological states is discussed.", "PMC3496971": "The nature of primed precursor T cells (primed pre-TD), capable of differentiating into effector T cells (TD) that mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), was investigated in B10 mice which were primed by intravenous (iv) injection of various doses of sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The presence of primed pre-TD was detected by the ability of T cells in the spleens from primed mice, which were treated in vitro with pertussis toxin and then transferred into naive recipient mice, to generate DTH in the recipient mice 14 days after transfer. The primed pre-TD were induced antigen specifically 1 day after mice were primed by iv injection of a suboptimal (10(3)), an optimal (10(5)), or supraoptimal (10(9)) dose of SRBC. They were replaced by TD 4 days after priming in optimally sensitized mice, while they were maintained without generating TD for at least 5 weeks after priming in mice primed with either a suboptimal or a supraoptimal dose of SRBC. They were L3T4-positive and dense cells, fractionated in the high-density layers on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient, and capable of transforming into less dense TD, fractionated in the low-density layers. These results indicate that primed pre-TD, which are induced by an antigen signal and then can be activated by a nonspecific stimulus, are present not only in responsive mice but also in unresponsive mice, suggesting that either the generation of TD from primed pre-TD or primed pre-TD alone is the decisive factor for either responsiveness or unresponsiveness.", "PMC3557227": "During a three-year field study of the socio-ecology of Sumatran orang-utans, their use of the canopy was investigated in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia. This paper concerns the positional behaviour of different age-sex classes of orang-utans. Adolescents and females with infants differed significantly from an adult male in the following respects: the use of locomotion types (more 'quadrumanous scrambling' and perhaps also 'quadrupedal walking' and less 'tree swaying'); substrate use during resting, and travelling and resting heights. We suggest that large body size restricts the travel route options in higher forest strata and necessitates the use of the lower stratum. Here, 'tree swaying' is an efficient method of progression, particularly for heavy animals. Mothers with infants are forced to travel in the lower zones as well. The fact that they return to a greater heights when they go to rest might suggest that they travel lower in spite of a greater predation risk.", "PMC4928265": "Influences of estrogen and progesterone on the development of hyperinsulinemia and augmented pancreatic islet insulin secretion during pregnancy were assessed in this study. Groups of female rats were injected subcutaneously for 21 days with varying daily dosages of estradiol benzoate or progesterone in oil. On day 21, pancreatic islets were isolated by a collagenase method. Total insulin secretion was measured after 90-min incubations of 10 islets in buffered medium containing glucose. Higher physiologic dosages of estradiol or progesterone, singly or in combination, significantly increased islet secretion above values of untreated control rats and were comparable to augmented islet responses of term, 3-wk pregnant rats. Diameter and protein content of islets obtained from steroid-treated and pregnant rats exceeded control measurements in these instances. However, 2-hr preincubations of control islets with 1 or 10 mug/ml of either steroid did not influence subsequent glucose-stimulated insulin output. In related studies, plasma insulin responses during 30 min intravenous glucose tolerance tests were significantly above control responses in term-pregnant rats and animals receiving comparable dosages of steroids for 3 wk. Unlike pregnancy or progesterone treatment, estradiol administration alone or with progesterone significantly lowered postchallenge plasma glucose concentrations. These results indicate that estradiol and progesterone contribute to enhanced islet insulin secretion and plasma insulin responses to glucose administration during pregnancy. This change is not acutely produced but can be related to hypertrophy of islets following chronic hormonal administration. Although the data do not distinguish between direct and indirect beta-cytotrophic effects of these sex steroids, metabolic actions of estradiol and progesterone may differ, since estrogen treatment lowers plasma glucose curves following the induction of hyperinsulinemia.", "PMC2572694": "Pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs were administered either dl-propranolol, atenolol or dl-nebivolol at cumulative doses of 0 (vehicle), 0.0025, 0.01, 0.04, 0.16 and 0.64 mg/kg i.v. After each dose, heart rate and diastolic blood pressure responses to isoproterenol (0.125 micrograms/kg/min i.v. for 5 min), as well as plasma glucose, insulin, lactate and free fatty acid responses, were measured. Heart rate and free fatty acid changes were taken as beta-1 adrenergic indices, with the other parameters taken as beta-2 adrenergic indices. The antagonist dose estimated to cause 50% inhibition of each isoproterenol response (ID50) was calculated. Nebivolol and atenolol had nearly identical cardiovascular profiles, which were much more beta-1 selective than that of propranolol [heart rate and blood pressure ID50 values, mg/kg: 0.034, 0.036 (propranolol); 0.058, 0.713 (nebivolol); 0.047, 0.506 (atenolol)]. Propranolol also potently inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated glucose, insulin and lactate increases (ID50S: 0.020, 0.078 and 0.007 mg/kg, respectively). Nebivolol and atenolol were much weaker inhibitors of these metabolic responses than propranolol (5-fold-35-fold and 8-fold-greater than 90-fold, respectively). Insulin responses were equivalently inhibited by both nebivolol and atenolol (ID50S greater than 0.4 mg/kg), whereas glucose and lactate ID50S for nebivolol were 0.183 and 0.243 mg/kg, respectively, with atenolol ID50S greater than 0.64 mg/kg. Free fatty acid responses were attenuated by all three antagonists with ID50 values of 0.103, 0.100 and 0.028 mg/kg for propranolol, nebivolol and atenolol, respectively. These in vivo studies demonstrate that dl-nebivolol significantly inhibited the beta-1 cardiac response at doses which did not produce either beta-2 cardiovascular or metabolic effects.", "PMC2784199": "Nonsmoking policies are being implemented increasingly in worksites across the country. This cross-sectional study examined attitudes toward worksite nonsmoking policies and worksite norms about smoking and cessation. Data were collected by telephone interview from 711 smokers and recent ex-smokers employed in seven worksites in Bloomington, Minnesota, in 1986. The findings indicated widespread support for nonsmoking policies even among smokers. Support for nonsmoking policies was especially high among respondents interested in quitting smoking, those concerned about the health effects of smoking, those reporting high coworker support for prior cessation attempts, and those working with a high proportion of nonsmokers. Support for nonsmoking policies was also correlated with smoking cessation in the 18 months prior to the survey. The clustering of these social norms is indicative of a worksite \"culture\" that may either support nonsmoking or inhibit cessation.", "PMC2901902": "In this study, the reversal of the potentiating effect of idazoxan, a selective alpha 2-antagonist, on adrenal catecholamine release elicited by splanchnic nerve stimulation in anaesthetized and vagotomized dogs, was investigated with the use of oxymetazoline, a selective alpha 2-agonist. Stimulation of the left splanchnic nerve (5.0-V pulses of 2 ms duration for 3 min at a frequency of 2 Hz) was applied before and 20 min after the i.v. injection of each drug. Blood samples were collected in the adrenal vein before and at the end of each stimulation. The results show that the release of catecholamines induced by electrical stimulation was potentiated by 50% after idazoxan injection (0.1 mg/kg). This enhanced response was significantly antagonized by the subsequent injection of oxymetazoline (2 micrograms/kg). The alpha 2-modulating effect appears to be related to the amount of catecholamines released during the stimulation, since by subgrouping of the data on the basis of the degree of potentiation by idazoxan, it was observed that this drug was more efficient when catecholamine release was higher during control stimulation. In contrast, the reversing effect of oxymetazoline was found to be more pronounced when catecholamine release was lower. These results thus suggest that the sensitivity of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor mechanism may depend upon the in situ concentration of adrenal catecholamine release during electrical stimulation and that the potentiating effect of alpha 2-blockade can be reversed by activation of those receptors by a selective alpha 2-agonist.", "PMC2292188": "Several steps were taken to determine the seasonal variation of IgE and IgG antibody against Short Ragweed, Timothy Grass, Tag Alder and White Ash. Extracts of the above pollen grains were separated into their allergen components using SDS-gel electrophoresis and transblotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Western blotting) and probed with sera from atopic patients in every month (August 1987-July 1988). The IgE and IgG antibody against the specific-allergens were detected by double antibody immunoenzyme assay. The percentage of binding was determined by using a 620 video-densitometer. Results indicate that there was no reasonable IgE antibody before the pollination season, but IgEAb appeared after the season and was detectable for several months. Negligible amounts of IgGAb were observed.", "PMC2651753": "Increased urinary excretion of C5b-9 distinguishes passive Heymann nephritis from other forms of experimental glomerulonephritis in the rat. In the passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) model of membranous nephropathy (MN) subepithelial deposits form from anti-Fx1A antibody reacting with antigen expressed on the glomerular epithelial cell membrane followed by membrane patching and shedding of immune complexes. Immune complex deposits are accompanied by deposits of C5b-9 which is required for the mediation of proteinuria. We tested the hypothesis that C5b-9 assembly on the epithelial cell membrane might result in C5b-9 excretion in the urine, which would distinguish this autoimmune mechanism of MN from other processes that result in subepithelial immune complex deposits. Using monoclonal antibodies developed to rat C6 and a rat C5b-9 neoantigen, in a sensitive ELISA assay, elevated urinary excretion of rat C5b-9 was documented in PHN associated with on-going glomerular immune deposit formation. No urinary C5b-9 was detectable in MN induced by an exogenous antigen (cationized IgG) despite equivalent glomerular C5b-9 deposits, or in models of nephrotoxic nephritis, subendothelial immune complex nephritis, anti-mesangial cell membrane antibody-induced nephritis or two non-immune nephropathies. Infusion of preformed C5b-9 in proteinuric animals excluded glomerular filtration of C5b-9 as a contributing mechanism to urinary C5b-9 excretion. We conclude that in the rat, increased urinary excretion of C5b-9 is a marker of MN induced by antibody to a glomerular epithelial cell antigen. Urine C5b-9 excretion reflects active glomerular immune deposit formation and distinguishes MN induced by this mechanism from other forms of MN as well as from other glomerular diseases with equivalent glomerular C5b-9 deposits.", "PMC4054854": "The effects of severe hyperprolactinemia induced by MtTW15 tumors (prolactin- and growth-hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma) on penile reflex activity and blood hormones were examined. There was no significant adverse effect of hyperprolactinemia on penile reflexes at 7, 14, or 21 days after tumor inoculation. However, a virtual elimination of penile reflex activity was observed 34 days after inoculation. Additionally, significant decrements in serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and an elevation in progesterone were seen at this time concomittant with greatly increased prolactin levels. The results suggest that erectile dysfunction may contribute to hyperprolactinemia-induced copulatory failure.", "PMC3265570": "The indication of tonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis was discussed from the standpoint of clinical immunology. Elevated serum IgG was observed in 29.8% of the patients under 8 years of age preoperatively. In contrast, in 25% of patients between 9-15 years of age, serum IgG was low preoperatively. In the patients over 16 years of age no abnormal serum IgG was found, and the elevated serum IgG returned to normal after tonsillectomy. The patients with normal serum IgG preoperatively retained normal values postoperatively. The low preoperative IgG level group still remained low postoperatively. As to postoperative improving symptoms, high and low grade fever improved most (100%), followed by cervical lymphadenopathy (93%), frequent absence from school (93%), sore throat (88%) and recurrence of bronchitis (85%). The patients with recurrent tonsillitis for 8 years showing high serum IgG had indications for tonsillectomy.", "PMC3815771": "Between October 1984 and September 1986, we attempted transcatheter umbrella closure, using the Rashkind PDA occluder, of 12 congenital or postoperative cardiovascular defects (other than patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]) in 11 patients. In each, we used the umbrella for closure because the defect was too short and/or too large to close with conventional transcatheter methods. The defects included three post-Glenn venous communications (superior vena cava-right atrium, n = 2; azygos vein to inferior vena cava), four congenital \"interatrial defects\" producing cyanosis (\"coronary sinus\" septal defect, left superior vena cava to left atrium, patent foramen ovale, left inferior vena cava to left atrium), and five non-PDA systemic-to-pulmonary arterial communications (two congenital and three postoperative). Ten of 12 defects were embolized successfully; nine had complete or subtotal closure, and one was partially closed. The first attempted closure resulted in embolization of a 12 mm device to a lower-lobe pulmonary artery, without clinical sequelae. No other complications occurred. Clinical improvement was most dramatic in those patients whose cyanosis was relieved and less obvious when pulmonary blood flow was reduced. The Rashkind umbrella device, originally designed for closure of PDA, considerably expands the list of congenital or operative defects that can be closed nonsurgically.", "PMC2134290": "We analyzed statistically two thousand orthodontic patients in Meikai University Hospital (formerly Josai Dental University Hospital) who have undergone treatment since the establishment of the hospital (1970-1985).

The clinical signs were jaundice and amaurosis. Clinicopathological findings suggested cholestasis. A tentative diagnosis of lead poisoning was made when basophilic stippling of erythrocytes was observed in a peripheral blood smear. The diagnosis was confirmed by finding a lead concentration of 2280 micrograms/litre in a venous blood sample. Cage bars painted with red lead appeared to be the source of the poison. The lead was chelated by the intramuscular administration of 2,3 dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL) and calcium disodium edetate for seven days, followed by oral D-penicillamine for five weeks. The encephalopathy was treated with dexamethasone sodium phosphate. Recovery from the blindness was noted after 10 days and marked improvement of the general well being of the animal was observed after one month.", "PMC2386530": "KCl transport plays an important role in the control of 'young' red cell volume and hence MCHC. The activity of this pathway declines rapidly during maturation in vitro irrespective of whether the transporter is functioning or not. The presence of plasma retards the rate at which the transporter becomes cryptic; N-ethyl maleimide can restore transport activity. Low pH is more effective as an activator of the transporter than hypotonicity, suggesting that protons stimulate the transporter directly rather than via a change in cell volume.", "PMC2330106": "Eight epileptic patients receiving anticonvulsants had recurrent visual disturbances in the form of diplopia and oscillopsia in the horizontal or vertical planes. The symptoms could be ascribed to impaired vergence mechanisms, vertical nystagmus, or abnormalities of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Other eye movements, such as pursuit and gaze-holding, were also affected, but did not lead to complaints. Episodes of visual disturbance were often preceded by prodromes of ocular or systemic discomfort, after which oscillopsia or diplopia evolve rapidly. The symptomatology was stereotyped but unique for each patient and may reflect idiosyncratic susceptibility to the ocular motor side effects of anticonvulsants. Six of the 8 patients were taking carbamazepine and phenytoin in combination, which have similar effects on the ocular motor system.", "PMC3329490": "This paper was presented at the 1986 Congress of the GEM, as a teaching conference on treatment of the boutonniere deformity, based on the experience of the Nancy Hand Unit.

Published trans fatty acid values in foods were used to calculate the trans octadecenoic acid present in the diets. The usefulness of this method was tested by comparing the estimated values with values obtained by chemical analysis of diets collected by the duplicate portion technique from the same subjects over the same period of time. There was no significant difference in the values for the trans octadecenoic acid content of the 54 diets used in this study whether the values were calculated from the diet records or determined by chemical analysis. Dietary trans octadecenoic acid averaged 5.3% of total fatty acids by both methods. The mean trans octadecenoic acid in the daily diet was 2.8 gm as calculated from the diet records and 2.6 gm according to actual analysis. Those values were not significantly different. The present study demonstrated that the trans octadecenoic acid content of the diets of a group of adolescent girls can be estimated from diet records using previously published values for individual food items.", "PMC3722453": "Three physiological classes of retinal ganglion cell project to the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLGN). The dorsal laminae A, A1, and magnocellular C receive X and Y retinal input, whereas the ventral parvicellular laminae C1 and C2 receive predominantly W input. We have compared quantitatively the retinal synaptic terminals of the dorsal and ventral laminae to determine whether there are morphological differences in the terminals that correspond to their different response properties. Anterogradely labeled retinal synaptic terminals in all laminae contained pale mitochondria and large, round synaptic vesicles. However, retinal terminals with pale mitochondria varied in size and synaptic organization in different laminae. The terminals in the A laminae were, on average, quite large and made numerous contacts with conventional dendritic profiles and with profiles that themselves contained synaptic vesicles (F2 profiles). The terminals in lamina C that contained pale mitochondria had a smaller overall mean area. Terminals with pale mitochondria in C1 and C2 were almost all small and synapsed with F2 profiles less frequently than did terminals in the A laminae or in lamina C. These results provide quantitative evidence that visual areas receiving W-type retinal input contain smaller retinal terminals and have a different synaptic organization from that of laminae receiving X and Y input.", "PMC3426769": "Recent animal studies have shown that alcohol intoxication in utero leads to a decrease in foetal weight and an increase in that of placenta. These findings are not, however, satisfactorily explained. The object of this study was to investigate these two effects, using inhalation of various concentrations of ethanol vapour as a method of intoxication. Three groups of 12 gravid female rats (treated groups) were intoxicated by permanent exposure to an alcohol atmosphere (19, 20 or 21 mg/l.). Three control groups of 12 gravid females were not intoxicated but had their diet reduced to the same energy intake as the treated groups. On day 21 of pregnancy, foetuses and placentas were surgically removed and individually weighed. The body-weight of foetuses was found to be lower in the treated groups than in the respective controls. Additionally the reduction of foetal weight was directly related to the severity of intoxication. Increases in placental weight were observed in the three intoxicated groups. The differences observed between foetal and placental weights may be interpreted as a foeto-protective phenomenon.", "PMC1523333": "A survey of 523 facilities performing radiographic lumbosacral spine examinations was conducted as a part of the Nationwide Evaluation of X-Ray Trends program in 1987 and 1989.

Fine needle aspiration biopsies of all the cold thyroid nodules and plasma calcitonin (CT) measurement in case of suggestive clinical features allow an accurate pre-operative diagnosis and the best therapeutic conditions. A cervico-mediastinal check-up, a screening for a Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2a or 2b, the removal of all tumoral cervico-thoracic tissue by total thyroidectomy, a careful node excision and the pathological examination by a skillful pathologist using immunohistochemistry are the main therapeutic methods. Additional treatment such as external radiotherapy, chemotherapy and radiopharmaceutics are indicated when surgery is incomplete, when the tumor is inoperable and when there are extensive distant metastases. Basal and pentagastrin stimulated CT is the best tool in post surgical follow-up. Disappearance may indicate a long remission, even a cure. Persistence of an abnormal level necessitates the search for secreting tumoral site with non invasive methods such as ultrasonography, computed tomography and scintigraphy, avoiding blind aggressive treatments.

For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) it has been reported that antibodies can enhance infection of phagocytic cells. We show that HIV-1 can infect an Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cell line and that low levels of anti-HIV antibodies enhance infection. The enhanced infection was characterized by an increase in viral DNA and increased HIV p24 protein production. Detection of cell surface antigen expression of CD4, the receptor for HIV, Fc-receptor type II for IgG, but not of type I and III could be demonstrated by immunofluorescence cytometry. The enhancement was abrogated when infection was performed in presence of a monoclonal antibody directed against CD4. Based on these results we conclude that antibody mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection can also occur in non-phagocytic cells in a CD4 dependent manner and that IgG Fc-receptors other than types I or III are involved in this process.", "PMC3025346": "The complete nucleotide sequence of the P + C mRNA of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PF3) was determined by sequencing cDNA, viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The P + C mRNA is 2009 nucleotides in length, exclusive of poly(A), and contains two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). The P + C mRNA encodes two proteins, the 602 amino acid nucleocapsid phosphoprotein P and the 199 amino acid non-structural protein C. Peptide mapping confirmed that the two proteins are unrelated. Hybrid-arrest translation experiments assigned each of the two proteins to its respective ORF. These studies showed that the coding strategy of the PF3 P + C mRNA is similar to that of Sendai virus. Amino acid sequence alignment showed that the P and C proteins of PF3 and Sendai virus represent homologous pairs. However, these homologies are represented by high contents of accepted amino acid substitutions and by similarity in hydropathy profiles rather than by high contents of exact amino acid matches. Homology with the P and C proteins of measles, canine distemper and respiratory syncytial viruses was at the threshold of significance. The patterns of amino acid sequence homology among the paramyxovirus HN, F, NP, P and C proteins are compared.", "PMC3286859": "The production of a known mammalian metabolite of the antihistamine triprolidine through fungal metabolic transformation has been demonstrated. The filamentous fungus Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 9245 was grown in Sabouraud dextrose broth containing triprolidine hydrochloride monohydrate. One major metabolite was extracted with methylene chloride, isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and identified by its proton-nuclear magnetic resonance and desorption chemical ionization mass spectral properties as hydroxymethyl triprolidine (2-[1-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl)-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl-1-propenyl)] pyridine). After 240 h of incubation, the hydroxymethyl derivative represented approximately 55.0% of the initial dose. Fungal oxidation of hydroxymethyl triprolidine to the corresponding carboxylic acid triprolidine derivative (also a known mammalian triprolidine metabolite) was not observed. No mutagenic activity was observed for triprolidine and hydroxymethyl triprolidine by reversion of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA104 at concentrations up to 1000 and 200 micrograms/plate, respectively. These results suggest that the fungal metabolism of triprolidine to the hydroxymethyl derivative occurs predominantly through pathways which do not result in mutagenic activation. Incubation of C. elegans with triprolidine under an 18O2 atmosphere and subsequent electron impact mass spectral analysis of the hydroxymethyl triprolidine formed indicate that molecular oxygen was incorporated into the methyl group and suggest a mono-oxygenase catalyzed reaction. This study parallels previous studies on the mammalian metabolism of triprolidine and clearly indicates that the microbial transformation of triprolidine is a useful alternative for the synthesis of potential mammalian metabolites.", "PMC5013595": "Protein synthesis and displacement in photoreceptor and pigment epithelial cells of inbred normal (Fisher) and mutant (RCS) rats with inherited retinal degeneration has been studied by light and electron microscope radioautography. Groups of animals 14, 15, 17, 19, 27, 35, and 50 days of age were injected with amino acids-H(3) and killed at subsequent time intervals. In normal rats, radioactive protein synthesized in the rod inner segments was incorporated into outer segment saccules and displaced outward; the total renewal time of outer segments at all ages was approximately 9 days. In RCS photoreceptors, outer segment displacement was slowed from the normal rate before day 17 and at all subsequent stages. Most of the newly synthesized protein appeared to migrate only into the basal third of the outer segments. Labeling of pigment epithelial cells in RCS rats was always heavier than in controls. Labeled protein was displaced as early as 1 hr postinjection from pigment epithelial cell somas into the apical processes, and by 2 hr postinjection was located in the adjacent lamellar whorls characteristic of the mutant rat retina. After 1 day, radioactivity was present in the 14, 15, 17, and 19 day series of RCS rats in the apical third of the outer segment layer (occupied mainly by extra lamellar material) while there were few silver grains in the middle third of the layer (occupied mainly by distal parts of outer segments). The RCS pigment epithelial cells thus have an unusual synthetic role and appear to be a source of the extra lamellar material. Electron microscope examination revealed that many intact pigment epithelial cell processes were incorporated into the large whorls of extra lamellae. In addition, many disorganized outer segment saccules were observed in continuity with longer membranous lamellae and large lamellar whorls. The extra lamellar material therefore appears to be derived from both rod outer segments and pigment epithelial cells.", "PMC3949170": "Various parameters of copulatory behavior were examined in intact and castrated testosterone-(T-)treated male rats of various ages ranging from 3 to 27 months. Serum T levels were controlled by subcutaneous implantation of different sizes of T-filled Silastic capsules at the time of castration. In intact male rats, scores of various parameters of copulatory behavior declined gradually from middle age and no ejaculation was observed in any rats over 22 months of age. When serum T levels were maintained at 0.78-0.87 ng/ml for 6 months from 4 months of age, these rats showed the same copulatory activity as intact rats, except that fewer rats exhibited ejaculation at 8 and 10 months of age and showed decreased total mount frequency at 10 months of age. Even when serum T levels were maintained at 2.95-3.53 ng/ml for a period of 6 months from 18 months of age, copulatory activity still declined gradually and no rats over 22 months of age ejaculated. However, long-term elevation of serum T level could prevent further decline of intromission frequency in old age. These results indicate that the copulatory activity of male rats in response to circulatory T declined with advancing age and that prolonged low levels of serum T had only a minor role in the onset of decreased responsiveness of neural male sexual behavior.", "PMC5013596": "Electric organs in Sternarchidae are of neural origin, in contrast to electric organs in other fish, which are derived from muscle. The electric organ in Sternarchus is composed of modified axons of spinal neurons. Fibers comprising the electric organ were studied by dissection and by light- and electron microscopy of sectioned material. The spinal electrocytes descend to the electric organ where they run anteriorly for several segments, turn sharply, and run posteriorly to end blindly at approximately the level where they enter the organ. At the level of entry into the organ, and where they turn around, the axons are about 20 micro in diameter; the nodes of Ranvier have a typical appearance with a gap of approximately 1 micro in the myelin. Anteriorly and posteriorly running parts of the fibers dilate to a diameter of approximately 100 micro, and then taper again. In proximal and central regions of anteriorly and posteriorly running parts, nodal gaps measure approximately 1 micro along the axon. In distal regions of anteriorly and posteriorly running parts are three to five large nodes with gaps measuring more than 50 micro along the fiber axis. Nodes with narrow and with wide gaps are distinguishable ultrastructurally; the first type has a typical structure, whereas the second type represents a new nodal morphology. At the typical nodes a dense cytoplasmic material is associated with the axon membrane. At large nodes, the unmyelinated axon membrane is elaborated to form a closely packed layer of irregular polypoid processes without a dense cytoplasmic undercoating. Electrophysiological data indicate that typical nodes in proximal regions of anteriorly and posteriorly running segments actively generate spikes, whereas large distal nodes are inactive and act as a series capacity. Increased membrane surface area provides a morphological correlate for this capacity. This electric organ comprises a unique neural system in which axons have evolved so as to generate external signals, an adaptation involving a functionally significant structural differentiation of nodes of Ranvier along single nerve fibers.", "PMC2729916": "The resemblance of the filamentous inclusions in inclusion body myositis (IBM) to mumps virus nucleoproteins and the report of immunoreactivity of the inclusions for mumps virus antigens have implicated the mumps virus in the etiology of IBM. We tested the mumps virus hypothesis by in-situ hybridization with a cDNA probe specific for the mumps virus nucleocapsid gene, and immunocytochemically with antibodies against \"soluble\" and \"viral\" mumps antigens. The tests were performed on muscle specimens (IBM, 20; acid maltase deficiency, 4; chloroquine myopathy, 2; nonweak control subjects, 5) and mumps virus-infected and uninfected HEp-2 cells. The in-situ hybridization study showed a strong specific signal in the infected HEp-2 cells but no specific signal in IBM, other myopathies, or nonweak control subjects. The immunocytochemical study showed specific binding of the antimumps antibodies to the infected HEp-2 cells but demonstrated only nonspecific binding of these antibodies around rimmed vacuoles in IBM, acid maltase deficiency, and chloroquine myopathy. These studies cast doubt on the mumps hypothesis of IBM.", "PMC3775805": "Liver tissue from rats administered 13 different alkyl halides and 4 other hepatotoxins were assayed for indices of hepatic heme synthesis. These included aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-dehydratase activity, porphyrin content, microsomal cytochrome P-450 and reduced glutathione content. Consistent decreases in ALA-dehydratase activity (14 of 17 compounds) and cytochrome P-450 content (14 of 17 compounds) were found. Significant changes in glutathione and porphyrin content also occurred after exposure to some compounds, but were not consistent. Alkyl halides are a class of toxicologically important compounds which have been found to exert an influence on hepatic heme synthesis.", "PMC2647316": "Enzyme activities related to fatty acid synthesis were determined in liver extracts of rats treated with thioacetamide (TAM) for 8 weeks. Lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in vivo were evaluated both in liver and in epididymal adipose tissue. The enzymatic activities of ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, glycerol kinase and NAD-kinase decrease progressively when TAM was chronically administered. However, in the same experimental conditions malic enzyme and other NADP-enzymes were noticeably increased. This increase can be related to an excess of NADPH production necessary for detoxification rather than for lipogenesis. The rate of in vivo incorporation of 3H2O into non-saponifiable fraction in liver showed an increase in the acute phase (1-3 days) of TAM-treatment. In the chronic phase of TAM intoxication this rate returned to values close to normality. The rate of in vivo incorporation of 3H2O to fatty acid fraction increased in the liver during the acute phase of TAM-treatment and showed a sharp decrease during the subacute and chronic phases of the intoxication. At the end of the 60-day period of TAM-treatment, the radioactivity incorporated into fatty acids was significantly lowered. These data showed that the alterations in hepatic lipogenesis observed during TAM administration are related to changes in the activities of lipogenic enzymes and probably are a consequence of alterations in plasma insulin concentration. Disturbances in lipid metabolism should play an important role in the pathogenesis of liver damage and its physiological significance could involve metabolic changes in proliferative and neoplastic liver diseases.", "PMC3224250": "A retrospective case-note survey was carried out on 31 subjects admitted with temporal-lobe epilepsy to the Maudsley hospital from 1974-1983 inclusive. Fourteen aggressive subjects were compared with the non-aggressive patients on 95 organic, developmental, and social variables. Aggressive behaviour was associated with male sex, early onset of seizures, and a history of long-standing behavioural problems. Aggressive subjects had lower mean IQ scores and poorer occupational records than controls. No relationship was found between aggression and the presence of specific EEG or CAT scan findings, or a history of psychosis. The results demonstrate the complex interplay between organic and socially mediated factors underlying aggressive behaviour in temporal-lobe epilepsy.", "PMC3982212": "The sexual dimorphism in hepatic drug metabolism found in Crl:CD-1 mice is due to the normally repressive effects of testicular androgens on the activities of hepatic monooxygenases. The ability of testosterone to elevate the Michaelis constant (Km) and reduce the maximum velocity (Vmax) of hepatic hexobarbital hydroxylase is dependent upon the pituitary, so that in the hypophysectomized mouse androgens have no repressive effects on the activities of hepatic monooxygenases.", "PMC2873824": "Patients with allergic diseases are characterized by the presence of elevated serum IgE and specific IgE antibodies against a variety of environmental allergens, especially house dust, mites and molds in Taiwan. A series of studies on allergic asthmatic children have been conducted to explore the non-immunological and immunological causes for their augmented production of IgE antibody and to explore the working mechanisms of hyposensitization. The results showed that the patients had multiple defects in their defects in their defense mechanisms, including hyper-permeability of mucosae, hyperreactivity of target organs, defective phagocyte functions, and deficient helper and suppressor T-cell functions. Hyposensitization was able to partially correct the immunological aberrations. More over, a newly found lymphokine termed \"T-cell growth factor\" or \"interleukin 2\" may be used not only as an indicator for the initiation and termination of hyposensitization, but may also provide a promising tool for the treatment of allergic diseases in the future because of its capability of enhancing and expanding allergen-specific suppressor T cells.", "PMC2806578": "Four cases of dissecting thoracic aneurysm associated with phaeochromocytoma have been reported in the World literature, of which only one survived surgery.

The mean pH of the post-operative samples [4.66 +/- 0.39 (SEM)] was significantly higher than that of the pre-operative ones [3.29 +/- 0.33 (SEM)]. A positive correlation with pH was observed for the concentrations of total and nitrate-reducing bacteria (median values 5.0 X 10(5) organisms/ml and 9.2 X 10(4) organisms/ml, respectively, for samples with pH greater than or equal to 1.2 X 10(3) organisms/ml and 0 organisms/ml, respectively, for samples with pH less than or equal to 2.5) and nitrite [mean values 22.5 +/- 3.1 (SEM) microM and 3.20 +/- 0.5 (SEM) microM for samples with pH greater than or equal to 6.5 and pH less than or equal to 2.5, respectively]. No correlation with pH was seen for the concentrations of nitrate [mean value 0.48 +/- 0.06 (SEM) mM] or N-nitroso compounds [mean value 0.30 +/- 0.06 (SEM) microM]. The concentrations of bacteria and nitrite, although increased in hypochlorhydric individuals, were lower than those reported for corresponding individuals in other, primarily British, studies. It is suggested that the relatively low concentrations of nitrite observed in our hypochlorhydric population may account for the absence of elevated concentrations of N-nitroso compounds and that the latter phenomenon may be related to the relatively low frequency of gastric cancer in Greece.", "PMC4018062": "The force-velocity curve (FVC) of arm flexion was established in 123 untrained males and 110 untrained females aged from 15 to 36 years, and 48 arm-trained athletes competing in different sport disciplines.

Within the given age range the level of the curve parameters of both untrained men and women was independent of age. On average, H was the same in all three groups. As compared to M0 of the untrained males, M0 of the athletes was 33% higher and M0 of the females was 38% lower; with regard to P0 these differences were +30% and -43% respectively. omega 0 was the same for trained and untrained males, whereas omega 0 of the women was 10% lower than omega 0 of the men.", "PMC1868023": "Although there is considerable controversy about what information regarding the diagnosis of cancer is most helpful to patients in meeting their psychological and medical needs, little research exists on what patients who are treated in non-specialized institutions are told about their diagnosis and treatment. We assessed the information that breast cancer patients received about their diagnosis from the perspective of both the patient and the physician, in order to determine whether they agree in their perceptions of communication, and whether the nature of patient-physician communication is associated with patient satisfaction. Questionnaires were completed by 1171 Italian breast cancer patients (representing a 81.5% response rate) and their physicians at the time of surgery for breast cancer. Only a minority of patients (47%) reported having been told that they had cancer. Satisfaction with information was highest among women who had been told the diagnosis. Patient and physician reports of what information was conveyed about the diagnosis differed for over half of patients, with highest satisfaction levels reported when both patient and physician stated that the diagnosis had been conveyed. While comparison of patient and physician reports should not be used to validate either source of information, the degree of patient-physician disagreement found in this research may alert physicians to potential difficulties that can arise in communicating with cancer patients.", "PMC2722838": "Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase catalyzes the final step in proline synthesis by NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate. We have purified and characterized this enzyme from human erythrocytes. Purification to homogeneity (approximately 600,000-fold) was accomplished by sonication, ultracentrifugation, 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography. The enzyme runs as a single band of 30,000 Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sizing chromatography under nondenaturating conditions demonstrates activity in the 300,000-350,000 Mr range, suggesting that the native enzyme exists as a 10- to 12-mer. The purified enzyme exhibits kinetic characteristics similar to those previously described for whole red cell homogenates. The Vmax is 10-fold higher and the Km for pyrroline-5-carboxylate is 7-fold higher with NADH versus NADPH as cofactor. The affinity for NADPH is 15-fold higher than that for NADH. Erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is competitively inhibited by NADP+. Unlike the enzyme from some other sources, erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is not inhibited by proline or ATP. Double label studies using [14C]pyrroline-5-carboxylate and [3H]exNADPH in the presence of both NADH and NADPH were performed to determine the preferred source of reducing equivalents. In the presence of physiologic concentrations of pyrroline-5-carboxylate and both pyridine nucleotides, all of the reducing equivalents came from NADPH.

This research examined the effects of cooping and water deprivation on contents of the digestive tract during feed withdrawal in two experiments. Broilers were reared to 48 days of age on litter in a windowless house. Corn-soybean meal diets and water were provided ad libitum. In the first experiment, broilers were continuously fed before feed withdrawal. In the second experiment, broilers were placed on a meal-feeding regimen of 1.5 h on feed and 4.5 h off feed for 42 h prior to feed withdrawal. Withdrawal began at the end of a 1.5-h feeding period. At the time of feed withdrawal, broilers were cooped, left on litter without water, or left on litter with water available. At 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after withdrawal, ten broilers from each treatment were killed and the crop, proventriculus plus gizzard, and small intestine were removed. The weight of the contents of each segment was determined. Water deprivation did not change the weight of contents in any segment. Cooped broilers retained digesta in the crop and proventriculus plus gizzard for a longer time than broilers on litter. The combination of meal feeding and cooping soon after feed withdrawal greatly increased the quantity of digesta in the crop 8 h after feed withdrawal. Cooping should be delayed until the crop is empty. Meal feeding increases the time required to accomplish this.", "PMC2615397": "Gompertz-Makeham kinetics of population mortality is derived in terms of competition between hypothetical life-prolonging and life-shortening regulatory elements (cells) interacting in each organism by generalized Volterra-type competitive exclusion.

It offers a natural classification of effects of exogeneous agents on longevity, including hormetic and paradoxical effects of toxic substances, thus relating to problems of risk assessment by extrapolation from high to low doses.

For this purpose, 600 microspheres (48 microns in diameter) were injected into the right carotid canal of rats, which induced an irreversible embolism in the right cerebrum. Three days after the operation, the cerebral mitochondria were isolated and their oxidative phosphorylation ability and succinate dehydrogenase activity were determined. Two types of mitochondria were obtained after cerebral embolism: one was mitochondria which revealed a marked decline in the oxidative phosphorylation activity when measured in the presence of glutamate or succinate as a substrate (severely injured mitochondria), and the other, those which revealed a decrease in the activity in the presence of succinate and an appreciable increase in the activity in the presence of glutamate (mildly injured mitochondria). Naftidrofuryl at the concentration of 3 microM elicited slight but significant restoration of the oxidative phosphorylation ability of the mildly injured mitochondria isolated from rats after the cerebral embolism, but not of the severely injured mitochondria. The succinate dehydrogenase activity of the brain mitochondria isolated from rats 3 days after the cerebral embolism was significantly decreased. Exposure of these mitochondria to 0.1 to 1 microM Naftidrofuryl significantly restored the succinate dehydrogenase activity. The results suggest that Naftidrofuryl is capable of exerting a beneficial effect in vitro on the brain mitochondria activity impaired by the cerebral embolism, particularly on the activity of mildly injured mitochondria.", "PMC2784779": "To examine the sequential development of early B-cell precursors in mouse bone marrow, B-lineage cells have been examined during a wave of post-irradiation regeneration. Cell phenotypes have been defined using double-immunofluorescence labelling techniques for (i) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT); (ii) B220 glycoprotein, detected by the binding of mAb 14.8; (iii); mu heavy chains in the cytoplasm (c mu) and at the cell surface (s mu). Three populations of mu- cells (TdT+14.8-; TdT+14.8+; TdT-14.8+) have been proposed to be early B-cell precursors which would give rise to c mu+s mu- pre-B cells and thus to s mu+ B lymphocytes. From 3 to 7 days after a sublethal dose (150 rads) of whole body gamma-irradiation, the B-lineage cells recovered rapidly to exceed normal numbers. The early B-cell precursors increased to peaks of 1.8-2.5 times normal numbers, preceding by 1 day a comparable increase and overshoot of c mu+s mu- pre-B cells, followed by recovery of s mu+ B lymphocytes. The TdT+14.8- cells peaked first at 5 days, subsiding again at 7-10 days with a shift from large- to medium-sized cells. The TdT+14.8+ cells showed a later peak (6 days), a more sustained wave in cell numbers and a delayed shift in cell size. The substantial population of 14.8+ mu- cells reached maximal observed values at 7 days and still maintained a predominantly large cell size profile at 10 days. The timing, cell-size shifts and progressive amplification of the waves of regeneration accord with a dynamic model in which the TdT+14.8-,TdT+14.8+ and TdT-14.8+ cells form three successive stages in B-cell differentiation before the expression of mu chains, presumptively including the stage of mu chain gene rearrangement. In addition, the results provide an experimental system for the enrichment of early B-cell precursors in mouse bone marrow.", "PMC3351168": "This article reports the use of various foodservice systems in hospitals of 300 beds or more and explores the relationship of system choice to hospital, city, and county size. The conventional system, which involves the production of food close to time of service, has been the traditional method of hospital foodservice for centuries. The technology of the 1960s initiated the use of alternative systems, such as cook-chill and cook-freeze. Data from a survey of 807 hospital foodservice directors indicate that the conventional system remains the primary choice for hospital foodservice, although an increasing number of hospitals are converting to the cook-chill system. Choice of foodservice system appears to be dependent on the size of the hospital, city, and county but did not differ by region across the United States. In general, the smaller the hospital, city, and county, the more likely the use of the conventional system.

The suitability of the ex vivo rat gastric chamber model for systematic studies of bile acid gastrotoxicity was assessed using deoxycholic acid (DCA 0.2-5.0 mmol/l). Acute challenge with 5.0 mmol/l DCA produced significant loss of gastric transmucosal potential difference (delta PD = 25.9 +/- 3.3 mV: mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01) compared with saline challenge (1.5 +/- 0.5 mV). Significant delta PD values were produced by DCA concentrations down to 0.5 mmol/l (16.0 +/- 2.8 mV). Challenge with 5.0 mmol/l DCA also caused significant increases in chamber fluid concentrations of nucleic acid (2.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml; p less than 0.05) and acid phosphatase (130 +/- 23.4 microU/ml; p less than 0.01).

Moreover, intracellular GSH levels are known to regulate T-lymphocyte function. In multiparameter FACS studies presented here, we show that relative GSH levels in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from HIV+ individuals are significantly lower than in corresponding subsets from uninfected controls. These studies define the relative intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from 134 HIV-infected individuals and 31 uninfected controls. The greatest decreases in intracellular GSH occur in subsets of T cells in individuals in the later stages of the HIV infection. In AIDS patients, GSH levels are 63% of normal in CD4+ T cells (p less than 0.0001) and are 62% of normal in CD8+ T cells (p less than 0.0001). Similarly, in AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients, GSH levels are 66% of normal in CD4+ T cells (p less than 0.003) and are 69% of normal in CD8+ T cells (p less than 0.003).

When exogenous Ep was injected into the plethoric mice the number of BFU-E(d4) increased after 24 h both in the bone marrow and spleen. In Ep stimulated polycythemic mice the CFU-E:BFU-E(d4) ratio did not achieve normal values, indicating that although Ep stimulation increased the number of BFU(d4), the number of CFU-E produced per BFU-E(d4) was lower than in normal nonpolycythemic mice.

The second part of the chapter has focused on three specific neurological entities to examine evidence for a possible association between neurological illness and life stress. There is some suggestion that certain vulnerable epileptic patients can experience convulsions in response to acute emotional upheaval or certain types of cognitive challenges. More commonly, it is probable that social stress and emotional tension can produce lowering of seizure threshold by increasing levels of fatigue and disrupting sleep. The latter factor, in particular, is known to lower seizure threshold. In the case of stroke, several dramatic cases of intracranial hemorrhage have been related to disastrous life circumstances. A general association between life stress and stroke has yet to be established. The case for a link between life events and onset of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis seems stronger. Events which produce emotional upset seem capable of worsening symptoms in patients with existing disease, and several studies have reported unusual life stresses in the period preceding onset of symptoms in this disorder.", "PMC3526277": "Hydrogels are widely studied materials for the preparation of sustained release drug dosage forms. Their soft, tissue-like consistency and their high biocompatibility in a number of applications make them promising candidates for this purpose. The water and the polymer in the gel form intricate structures and much research has been devoted to the elucidation of these structures, and of the interactions involved in their formation. Simple, drug-loaded hydrogels normally give a matrix-type delivery profile, in which the release rate is proportional to the square root of time; a number of approaches has been used to change this profile to other types of delivery, for instance to zero-order release. A number of in vivo tests using hydrogel delivery systems has given favourable results.", "PMC3591178": "Only early breast cancer can be cured. The aim of treatment of early breast cancer should be to provide the patient with the best possible chance of being cured. This should be the surgeon's paramount objective. Many factors must be taken into consideration before deciding whether aggressive curative treatment is justified. These factors include the position and extent of the primary tumour within the breast, the degree of involvement of the regional lymph nodes and the presence or absence of distant occult metastases. Also important are the exact histological type of the tumour, its grade of malignancy and the receptor status, if known. The age, general health and personal attitudes of the patient also will be influential. Total mastectomy continues to be the treatment of choice for early, curable breast cancer, combined as appropriate with radiotherapy to the regional lymph nodes.

In support of this relationship it was recently shown that, when given to primates, 2-amino-3-(methylamino)-propanoic acid (BMAA), a minor cycad component, can cause selective degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and clinical features similar to those of ALS. In order to test the relationship between ALS and cycads, we have developed a sensitive and precise gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) assay for BMAA which allows direct assessment of the BMAA content in foods and is directly applicable to the assay of BMAA in biologic tissues and fluids. After the addition of a deuterated isotopomer as an internal standard and transesterication with 2-methyl-1-propanol, BMAA was extracted into dichloromethane and then acylated with pentafluoropropionic anhydride before GC/MS. This method permits precise quantification of BMAA in the low picogram/sample range. Direct quantification of the BMAA content in the female gametophyte tissue (endosperm) of a range of cycad seeds collected from Guam confirmed the presence of BMAA at levels of approximately 1 g/g (dry weight). The presence of BMAA in the seed extract was confirmed after derivatization of an aliquot of the extract and GC/MS analysis in the scanning mode. BMAA was found to be present, albeit at lower levels, in the endosperm of the seeds of C. revoluta (0.32 mg/g) and C. media (0.29 mg/g).", "PMC2991257": "We have previously reported that anionic phospholipids (Philipson, K.D., and Nishimoto, A.Y. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 16-19) and other anionic amphiphiles (Philipson, K.D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13999-14002) stimulate Na+-Ca2+ exchange in cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. To further these studies, we have now investigated the effects of a variety of fatty acids on both Na+-Ca2+ exchange and passive Ca2+ permeability. Na+-Ca2+ exchange was stimulated by fatty acids by up to 150%. Unsaturated fatty acids were more potent than saturated fatty acids, and the stimulation was primarily due to a decrease in the apparent KM (Ca2+). There was a positive correlation between the ability of a fatty acid to stimulate Na+-Ca2+ exchange and to increase passive Ca2+ permeability. The methyl esters of fatty acids had no effects on either exchange or permeability indicating the importance of anionic charge. We conclude that the combination of local lipid disorder and anionic charge regulate Na+-Ca2+ exchange. Perturbations of the bilayer hydrophobic region and increased negative surface charge are both required for fatty acids to increase passive Ca2+ flux. Na+-Ca2+ exchange is stimulated when the ratio of membrane free fatty acid to phospholipid is about 5%. This level of fatty acid is achieved during 1 h of myocardial ischemia (Chien, K. R., Han, A., Sen, A., Buja, L. M., and Willerson, J. T. (1984) Circ.

S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4378-4383). CRP is relatively resistant to attack by the Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin whereas both mAb 64D1-CRP and cAMP-CRP are attacked by these proteases yielding N-terminal core fragments. The fragment patterns resulting from proteolysis of mAb 64D1-CRP and cAMP-CRP differ indicating that the CRP in each complex is in a different conformation. The data presented indicate that the preferred conformation of the antigenic site for mAb 64D1 is present in unliganded CRP. Binding of mAb 64D1 to CRP is inhibited at high cAMP concentration. Formation of a stable cAMP-CRP-lac P+-RNA polymerase open promoter complex resistant to dissociation by mAb 64D1 occurs at a much lower cAMP concentration. The observed increase in resistance to mAb 64D1 may reflect a possible conformational change in CRP effected by contact with RNA polymerase in the open promoter complex.", "PMC2878639": "Concentrations of putative neurotransmitter amino acids were measured in postmortem brains from 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 10 controls. Glutamate, aspartate, taurine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and alanine levels were examined in 9 cortical regions, hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. There were no significant alterations in aspartate, taurine, or alanine levels in any of the regions examined. Widespread significant reductions in cortical GABA concentrations were observed in the Alzheimer's brains, with the largest decreases in the temporal lobe. Overall values for glutamate concentrations in temporal and frontal cortices showed a significant 12% reduction in Alzheimer's brains, but the only individual cortical region showing a significant reduction in glutamate was the inferior temporal gyrus. These results suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons in Alzheimer's cerebral cortex may be selectively vulnerable to the disease process.", "PMC3991583": "Sprague-Dawley rats treated with cyclosporine (Cys) and appropriate controls were investigated with inulin, lithium and sodium clearances. It was found that Cys depressed glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and absolute proximal tubular reabsorption, while fractional proximal reabsorption was increased. As a normal proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity was found after volume expansion, and the intratubular pressure was normal, tubulotoxicity or obstruction of the tubular system by Cys was excluded. Increased fractional proximal reabsorption was also found with the occlusion time/transit time method. Intravenous Cys resulted in instantaneous renal functional changes qualitatively identical to those of prolonged Cys treatment. It was concluded that Cys nephrotoxicity is due to decreased ultrafiltration pressure, most probably due to a reversible spasm in the afferent glomerular arteriole.", "PMC3943556": "A preliminary technique is described for freezing and thawing of intact neural cell cultures and neural cell suspensions of adult mouse dorsal root ganglia which permitted the neurons to retain to a remarkable degree their usual morphological and electrophysiological characteristics.

It is based on an analysis of 3-day food intake records of 21,867 participants in the Nationwide Food Consumption Study (NFCS), 1977-78. Results from a subsample of 7,287 subjects showed a significantly greater variation from the median than from the mean for protein, vitamin A, and iron. Fewer than 30% of the respondents had intakes of any of the 11 nutrients studied within +/- 15% of the mean on all days. For all nutrients except energy and magnesium, less than 50% of the respondents had intakes within +/- 25% of the mean. Variability in intake was greatest for vitamins A and C, with 85% and 82% of respondents, respectively, having low and high daily intakes deviating by more than 25% from the mean. These findings document that 1-day food records alone are of limited value in assessing nutrient adequacy of an individual and quantify the magnitude of the variation over a 3-day period. The more adequate the mean nutrient intake, the less variability in intake from day to day.

In a first step bovine saliva was added in increasing quantities (in increments of 5% up to 50%) to normal rumen fluid samples collected via rumen fistula. Some relevant parameters of the rumen fluid were analyzed with these mixtures. The experiments were carried out in order to obtain data for the calculation of saliva inflow in samples collected by orally introduced probes. In a second step a sample of rumen fluid was aspirated from the ventral rumen sac via the fistula before each introduction of the rumen sound. Saliva inflow was calculated on the basis of the in vitro changes in pH and in Na+ and K+ concentrations noted with each 5% addition of saliva. RESULTS: The pH value increased with the addition of saliva more markedly for samples with a lower initial value. The sodium concentration in the rumen fluid increased almost linearly by an average of 2.5 mmol/l, while potassium concentration decreased by approximately 1.4 mmol/l with each 5% increase of saliva.

Two type of cells were found to express HLA-DR surface molecules: endothelial cells and nonfibroblastic non-B and non-T interstitial elements. The latter cells, which were localized both in the exocrine and endocrine portions of the organ, were distinguished in two main families (macrophagic and dendritic) according to their morphology, surface phenotype, and lysosomal enzymatic activities. The phenotype of cells belonging to macrophagic cell family was the following: Leu M1+, Leu M2+, Leu M3+, OKM1+, and OKT6-. In addition these cells were positive for the expression of lysosomal enzymes such as alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and acid phosphatase (AP). The \"dendritic\" cell family comprised, among others, cells that were characterized by the presence of numerous finger-like projections, the absence of Leu M1, Leu M2, Leu M3, OKM1, OKT6 surface antigens, and by the negativity for ANAE and AP.

The ratio of factor X activation to antithrombin III anti-factor Xa activity was increased in the diabetic patients (1.10 +/- 0.01 vs 1.01 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.01). Induced hyperglycaemia was able to mimic all these abnormalities, without changing factor X or antithrombin III concentration.

Trans-section of the antimesenteric border and cross-folding of the intestinal segments (Goodwin's cup-patch technique) is an efficient means of solving this problem and has been successfully used in the Kock pouch. We anastomosed the ileal low pressure reservoir to the membranous urethra in 22 male patients following radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. The mean observation time was 16 months (range 3-36). The capacity of the bladder substitute increased with time, the average being 450 ml after 6 months. In the first 4 patients with a short (2-5 cm) intestinal segment between the pouch and the urethra, micturition was prolonged, residual urine varied from 50 to 300 ml and bacteriuria was found. Occasional expulsions of several ml of urine were caused by peristalsis within this short tubular segment. In the following 18 patients, the low pressure reservoir was anastomosed directly to the membranous urethra. Micturition was good, with no notable residual urine, no bacteriuria and no paroxysmal urinary incontinence. However, a safety pad is used by half of the patients because once or twice a week, mainly at night, a few ml of urine may be lost. No significant changes in serum electrolytes, bicarbonate or creatinine were noted.

The contractile responses to the two agonists increased significantly in gastric fundus preparations isolated 6 and 12 weeks after the onset of diabetes, compared to those in tissues from control rats. Influx of Ca2+, induced by 10(-5) M acetylcholine and 60 mM KCl, increased significantly in gastric fundus isolated 6 weeks after the onset of diabetes. Insulin treatment from 3 to 6 weeks after the onset of diabetes restored the responsiveness of gastric fundus to agonists to control levels.

In these cases estimations of the volume of the opaque bodies were made, based on computer-integrated programmes (SO-MATOM D2). In 9 cases there was a history of thyroidectomy, on average 25 years previously. As a rule patients were referred in the age range between 40 to 60 years, those who had undergone thyroidectomy being on average somewhat older than the others. As presenting symptoms extrapyramidal syndromes, apoplexias, cephalea, affective organic alterations, alcoholism and dementia were noted. Cerebral localisation of bilateral, symmetrical calcification was most frequent in the pallidum, though this localisation may be responsible for numerous different neuropsychiatric symptoms. The dimensions of the opaque structures can be very greatly. Symptomatology seems to be practically independent of either cerebral localisation or volume, except that greater volumes of calcification seem to cause more pronounced neurological (extrapyramidal) symptomatology and dementia. The time-span between manifestation of the initial symptoms and diagnosis was shorter in neurological syndromes than in psychiatric cases. Like earlier workers, we found a high incidence (21%) of organic affective syndromes as an initial manifestation of Fahr's syndrome.", "PMC2150582": "The mechanism of length determination in bacteriophage lambda tails is discussed as a model for regulation in protein assembly systems. The lambda tail is a long flexible tube ending in a conical part and a single tail fiber. Its length is exactly determined in the sense that the number of major tail protein (gpV) molecules, which comprise more than 80% of the mass of the tail, is exactly the same in all tails. Assembly of gpV is regulated by the initiator complex, which contains the tail fiber and the conical part, and by the terminator protein gpU. There are two key points in the assembly of gpV with respect to length determination. (1) Assembly of gpV on the initiator pauses at the correct tail length. Binding of gpU to the tail only fixes the pause firmly. (2) When the tail length is too short, binding of gpU to tails is inhibited. Deletions and a duplication (both in frame) in gene H, which codes for one of the proteins in the initiator, result in production of phage particles with altered tail length. Moreover, the tail length is roughly proportional to the length of the mutated versions of gene H. This shows that the tail length is measured by the length of gene H protein (gpH), which seems to be approximately as long as the tail tube, if extended like a thread, according to secondary structure prediction (alpha-helices connected by other structures). Various pieces of evidence show that about six molecules of gpH are attached to the remaining portion of the initiator by the C-terminal part and folded into a somewhat compact form, while they are elongated as they are enclosed in the tail tube during assembly of gpV. Unlike interaction between the length-measuring genome RNA and the coat protein of tobacco mosaic virus, the major tail protein gpV does not bind specifically to the ruler protein gpH. Rather, gpH determines the tail length by inhibiting the binding of gpU to short tails and by signalling the pause when the correct tail length is attained.", "PMC2927601": "Twenty patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were followed up by angiography. Of the 20 AVMs, 16 were nontreated and the remaining 4 were residual. The follow-up periods between the two examinations were from 5 to 28 years, with a median interval of 15 years. At follow-up, the size of the AVM had increased in 4 patients (20%), decreased in 4 (20%), totally regressed in 4 (20%), and was unchanged in 8 (40%). In cases of enlarged AVMs, the patients were all young: from 0 to 11 years old at first angiography and from 6 to 30 at second angiography. The decrease or total regression of the AVM occurred in older patients (over 30 years old at second angiography), and the AVMs were relatively small and fed by single or a few feeders.

This effect was accompanied by a rapid increase of the redox potential up to +400 mV, fluctuating oxygen contents of maximal 0.8 mg/l, a significant decrease of pH below 7.0, a complete decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds and a considerable increase of total nitrogen caused by APS-addition. After 20 days, odour production could be noted again in the fresh slurry sample. It is assumed, that this effect is due to a population of yeasts, vigorously grown up towards the end of the test. The stored slurry sample was shown to be stable with respect to deodorization effect and yeasts could be found in portions lesser than 1%. In the fresh as well as in the stored slurry samples, organisms of the genus Bifidobacterium dominated towards the end of manure handling. In spite of an oxidised substrate it is assumed, that these anaerobic to aerotolerant microorganisms found a microbiotope with a reduced environment inside the flocks, built up by APS-addition. The facultatively anaerobic microorganisms, for the most part of the genus Bacillus, which mainly belong to producers of odorous compounds almost could be eliminated within 20 days at the latest by APS-treatment. It should be focused to prevent a secondary odour production by H2S-forming yeasts. This may be managed in future by an odour-reducing minimal APS-addition under a 2%-application.

Such knowledge is important not only in relation to the mechanisms of neural crest migration and differentiation, but also in understanding the ontogeny of the PNS. Of special interest in the latter regard is the origin of sympathetic ganglion cells and their innervation, since studies on ganglion cell innervation have suggested that the matching between pre- and postganglionic neurons might be based on their early positions along the neuraxis (see preceding paper). In the present study, I have used the quail-chick transplantation technique to examine the migratory patterns of the precursors of sympathetic ganglion cells, dorsal root ganglion cells, and melanocytes that originate from 1 or 2 segments of the trunk neural crest. My results indicate that precursors of sympathetic ganglion cells, on average, migrate 2 segments rostrally and 3 segments caudally. Thus, individual sympathetic ganglia comprise neurons that originate from up to 6 segments of the neuraxis. Precursors of melanocytes also migrate along the rostrocaudal axis, but to an even greater extent than sympathetic ganglioblasts. In contrast, precursors of dorsal root ganglion cells do not migrate at all along the rostrocaudal axis (although they migrate along a ventromedial pathway to give rise to the dorsal root ganglia of the same segmental level). The number of neural crest segments contributing to each sympathetic ganglion is approximately equal to the number of spinal cord segments contributing to its innervation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2673414": "The activities of three acylation systems for 1-alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine (1-alkenyl-GPE), 1-acyl-GPE and 1-acylglycerophosphocholine (1-acyl-GPC) were compared in rat brain microsomes and the acyl selectivity of each system was clarified. The rate of CoA-independent transacylation of 1-[3H]alkenyl-GPE (approx. 4.5 nmol/10 min per mg protein) was about twice as high as in the case of 1-[3H]acyl-GPE and 1-[14C]acyl-GPC. On the other hand, the rates of CoA-dependent transacylation and CoA + ATP-dependent acylation (acylation of free fatty acids by acyl-CoA synthetase and acyl-CoA acyltransferase) of lysophospholipids were in the order 1-acyl-GPC greater than 1-acyl-GPE much greater than 1-alkenyl-GPE. HPLC analysis of newly synthesized molecular species revealed that the CoA-independent transacylation system exclusively esterified docosahexaenoate and arachidonate, regardless of the lysophospholipid class. The CoA-dependent transacylation and CoA + ATP-dependent acylation systems were almost the same with respect to the selectivities for unsaturated fatty acids when the same acceptor lysophospholipid was used, but some distinctive acyl selectivities were observed with different acceptor lysophospholipids. 1-Alkenyl-GPE selectively acquired only oleate in these two systems. 1-Acyl-GPE and 1-acyl-GPC showed selectivities for both arachidonate and oleate. In addition, an appreciable amount of palmitate was transferred to 1-acyl-GPC, not to 1-acyl-GPE, in CoA- or CoA + ATP-dependent manner. The acylation of exogenously added acyl-CoA revealed that the acyl selectivities of the CoA-dependent transacylation and CoA + ATP-dependent acylation systems may be mainly governed through the selective action of acyl-CoA acyltransferase. The preferential utilization of oleoyl-CoA by all acceptors and the different utilization of arachidonoyl-CoA between alkenyl and acyllysophospholipids indicated that there might be two distinct acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases that discriminate between oleoyl-CoA and arachidonoyl-CoA, respectively. Our present results clearly show that all three microsomal acylation systems can be active in the reacylation of three major brain glycerophospholipids and that the higher contribution of the CoA-independent system in the reacylation of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, especially alkenylacyl-GPE, may tend to enrich docosahexaenoate in these phospholipids, as compared with in the case of diacyl-GPC.", "PMC3063768": "A unique method for serial comparison of electrocardiograms is introduced.

RD with opaque media, RD with proliferative vitroretinopathy, traction RD due to trauma or other factors, RD with posterior breaks, and giant tears were included. During the follow-up periods of 3-12 months, 27 cases (54%) obtained anatomic reattachment, 23 failed (46%). Of the successful case, 24 eyes achieved improvement, 2 eyes remained unchanged, and one eye became worse in their vision. The surgery complications were: retinal haemorrhage, choroidal haemorrhage, iatrogenic tears, and the development of cataract.", "PMC4020579": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the normal postnatal development of electrolyte and water transport in the large intestines of rats aged 10-20 days, to focus on the events taking place around the time of weaning, and to study the influence of different feeding patterns at the time of weaning on the normal development of the transport mechanisms in the large intestine. The net absorption of sodium, potassium, and water was investigated by using in vivo luminal isotonic perfusion in rats aged 12-40 days. The activity of the active transport enzyme Na-KATPase in the colonic mucosa of rats aged 10-40 days was determined. We found a significant decrease in the net absorption of electrolytes and water that was greatest around the time of weaning. Since the NaKATPase activity was lower in 10-16-day-old rats than in 40-day-old rats, we suggest that the high sodium and water uptake in the colon of suckling rats is independent of the sodium pump. Changes in the feeding patterns around the time of weaning, such as prolonged suckling, were associated with a significantly higher net absorption of electrolytes and water than in rats that were normally weaned at 20 days of age. The Na-KATPase activity was not significantly influenced by the weaning pattern.", "PMC2706102": "Biopsy specimens of the nasal mucosa from the inferior turbinate of infants aged 2 to 26 months were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The specimens were obtained from 23 clinically healthy infants and compared with those from 43 infants with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM). Potentially pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 61% of the control subjects and 90% of those with RAOM. Infants with RAOM had about as extensive alterations as the healthy ones. A single healthy child and one with RAOM had what was interpreted as a normal nasal mucosa; all others showed reduced frequencies of ciliated cells, deformation of cilia, extensive loss of normal mucosal epithelium, and metaplasia in their nasal epithelial lining. Severely damaged area could be seen close to more normal ones. Nasal mucosa in clinically healthy infants rarely had a normal appearance, probably due to frequent infections and the fairly long time needed for the repair process. We proposed that the high frequency of damaged, incompletely healed nasal mucosa may constitute an important factor with regard to the susceptibility to further infections.", "PMC3703281": "We reviewed the records of all patients treated for carcinoid tumors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1974 through 1984. Of 219 patients, 90 developed metastatic complications, and of these, 36 developed neurologic complications. Metastases, the most common neurologic complication, included epidural spinal cord compression (14 patients), intracranial metastases (13 patients), leptomeningeal metastases (1 patient), and peripheral nerve lesions (5 patients). Nonmetastatic complications were hepatic encephalopathy (six patients), herpes zoster infection (two patients), cerebral infarction due to septic emboli (one patient), superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (one patient), and carcinoid myopathy (one patient). The carcinoid syndrome was seen in eight patients (4%). Response of neurologic metastases to conventional radiation therapy was usually favorable. We conclude that (1) the frequency and type of neurologic complications associated with carcinoid tumors are similar to those seen with other systemic cancers; (2) CNS metastases are relatively common in patients with metastatic carcinoid (29%); and (3) the carcinoid syndrome is less common than CNS metastasis.", "PMC3889916": "Crude preparations of cytotoxins (CTXs) produced by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exert a marked cytotoxic effect when applied to cells in the presence of cycloheximide but in its absence can induce resistance to cytotoxicity. To examine the relationship between these cytotoxic and protective activities, we attempted to fully dissociate the CTX from the other proteins secreted by mononuclear cells. Mice injected with preparations of the cytokines secreted by peripheral blood mononuclear cells developed significant titers of serum antibodies to CTX(s). Splenocytes of such immunized mice were fused with NSO myeloma cells; a few among the resulting hybridoma cells secreted CTX-binding antibodies. Immunoadsorbents constructed with a monoclonal antibody produced by one of these hybridomas were used to purify to homogeneity a CTX (Mr approximately 17,500) from crude preparations of cytokines, by a single adsorption and elution cycle. Purified CTX was cytotoxic in the presence of cycloheximide but in its absence induced resistance to cytotoxicity; this resistance was manifested by decreased vulnerability to CTX in a subsequent incubation in the presence of cycloheximide. We conclude that CTX itself can induce certain changes in cells, which are reflected in resistance to its own cytotoxic effect.", "PMC3216352": "An audit was undertaken to determine how well a primary care team supported lay carers of the demented elderly. The following standards were set: (1) primary care teams should know of the existence of symptomatic demented elderly patients in the community; (2) lay carers should be knowledgeable about dementia; and (3) the resources which the lay carers felt they needed should be supplied unless they were unavailable.The primary care team knew of the existence of all symptomatic demented elderly patients in the practice but lay carers lacked knowledge about dementia and had unmet needs. Giving lay carers a booklet about dementia and reporting their unmet needs to the primary care team led to improvements in standards 2 and 3. In addition, stress among lay carers was reduced. In spite of a reduction in the number of carers' unmet needs, there was no overall change in the use of available resources following intervention.It is concluded that structured support is necessary and worthwhile in order to provide effective support for lay carers of the demented elderly in the practice.", "PMC2211551": "A 7-year-old girl with a 2-year history of elective mutism was successfully treated with phenelzine.

Alkaline sucrose gradient data suggest random induction of DNA strand breaks. A dose response with time at 37 degrees C or 43 degrees C (constant SPD) or with SPD concentration (constant time at 43 degrees C) was observed in terms of both DNA strand breaks and cell survival. The generation of peroxide was demonstrated in the absence of cells by the addition of SPD to medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Toxicity of SPD was reduced in saline, with catalase-thiourea and aminoguanidine, and enhanced by prior depletion of glutathione. Thermotolerance induced 16 h previously did not protect against SPD toxicity, suggesting that the reactive species from spermidine oxidation and heat damage do not produce related subcellular lesions.", "PMC3726324": "From its beginning, the Medical School at the University of Tromso aimed at obtaining a better balance between clinical medicine, basic science and community medicine in its curriculum. This was obtained by using the integrated model for teaching, having a separate study-block for community medicine, incorporating field work in local hospitals and with district doctors and requiring the students to write a scientific paper before qualifying. The 8-week field training with a district doctor started in 1978. Evaluations from these eight years have been analysed and show that students, during these eight weeks, are involved in many aspects of family- and community medicine. The programme has been given positive evaluations from both students and teachers. We conclude that the field training given to medical students in Tromso is an efficient way of preparing the medical students for future clinical work both inside and outside institutions.", "PMC2034607": "Benign tumors of the lung are infrequent diseases. Their symptoms depend on their localisation in the periphery of the lung or in the central airways. Cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnoea are the most frequent symptoms, they should cause further diagnostic investigations (X-ray in two directions, bronchoscopy). This paper shows the frequency, symptoms, diagnostic procedure and findings, and the treatment of benign lung tumors, giving a survey of the patients of a pneumologic clinic during ten years.", "PMC3952120": "The effects of diazepam on morphine analgesia dose effect curves in the formalin test and in two forms of the tail flick test were examined. In one form of the tail flick test the animals were restrained in wire restrainers (a stressful procedure) while in the other they were left free and briefly handheld for testing. Morphine analgesia in the restrained form of the test is known to depend on raphe magnus 5HT projections to the spinal cord while the other tests do not involve this system. Diazepam (0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg) noncompetitively antagonized morphine analgesia in the formalin test but had no effect on morphine analgesia in the tail flick test. It is concluded that diazepam does not antagonize morphine analgesia through its antianxiety action reducing the serotonergic response to stress. It is suggested that the sensitivity of the formalin test to diazepam antagonism of morphine analgesia may be of clinical significance since formalin test pain resembles postoperative pain in humans.", "PMC4048319": "The case histories of 72 women admitted to prison for contempt of court in 1979-83 were reviewed. The sample included 45% of all women imprisoned for contempt in England and Wales over the 5-year period. The contemnors were significantly older than other sentenced prisoners, one third were foreign born and 37.5% were suffering from psychiatric disorder. Two thirds of the mentally disordered group had a paranoid disorder, litigiousness was a prominent feature of their illness, and 52% committed contempt in the context of a matrimonial dispute or a dispute with neighbours.

A classification was made on the basis of heart rates sampled during the whole shift by portable memories. Extrapolating for the whole shift, the authors measured heart rates of 106.0 min(-1) (drivers) from the 2201 technology. The complementary values from the 1.1 m(3) technology were 107.7 min(-1) (driver's mates) and 105.2 min(-1) (drivers). The men's physical endurance limit would be exceeded when they handled dustbins without break. The investigated tasks are classified to be heavy in both technologies.", "PMC4004265": "Formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from glutamete catalyzed by a soluble extract from the unicellular green alga, Chlorella vulgaris, was abolished after incubation of the cell extract with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase). Cell extract was prepared for the ALA formation assay by high-speed centrifugation and gel-filtration through Sephadex G-25 to remove insoluble and endogenous low-molecular-weight components. RNA hydrolysis products did not affect ALA formation, and RNase did not affect the ability of ATP and NADPH to serve as reaction substrates, indicating that the effect of RNase cannot be attributed to degradation of reaction substrates or transformation of a substrate or cofactor into an inhibitor. The effect of RNase was blocked by prior addition of placental RNase inhibitor (RNasin) to the cell extract, but RNasin did not reverse the effect of prior incubation of the cell extract with RNase, indicating that RNase does not act by degrading a component generated during the ALA-forming reaction, but instead degrades an essential component already present in active cell extract at the time the ALA-forming reaction is initiated. After inactivation of the cell extract by incubation with RNase, followed by administration of RNasin to block further RNase action, ALA-forming activity could be restored to a higher level than originally present by addition of a C. vulgaris tRNA-containing fraction isolated from an active ALA-forming preparation by phenol extraction and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Baker's yeast tRNA, wheat germ tRNA, Escherichia coli tRNA, and E. coli tRNAglu type II were unable to reconstitute ALA-forming activity in RNase-treated cell extract, even though the cell extract was capable of catalyzing the charging of some of these RNAs with glutamate.", "PMC3529160": "Between 1969 and 1983 inclusive, the bovine variants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. bovis and M. africanum) were isolated from 75 patients with tuberculosis. This represented 2.9 per cent of all significant mycobacteria identified at the Liverpool Public Health Laboratory during this period. The clinical and radiological features of infection did not differ from those found with M. tuberculosis. There was an association between M. bovis infection, extrapulmonary disease and lifelong United Kingdom residency, and between M. africanum infection, pulmonary disease and immigrant status. Correlations between the present incidence of reactivated M. bovis disease and past prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in man and cattle, and between the isolation rate of M. africanum and the size of the immigrant community served by the laboratory, were also demonstrated. All the patients with M. bovis infection were considered to have a reactivated or slowly progressive primary infection. It is proposed that M. bovis only accounts for a small proportion of isolates from adults with tuberculosis because the organism displays a low tendency to reactivate.", "PMC3977657": "Of five patients with damage to the basal forebrain, four had lesions secondary to rupture of anterior cerebral or anterior communicating artery aneurysms, and one to the resection of an arteriovenous malformation. Computed tomographic scans and intraoperative reports confirmed damage to basal forebrain regions, which include septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens, substantia innominata, and related pathways. Behavioral disturbances featured a prominent amnesic syndrome and personality changes. The amnesia was distinguishable from that reported in patients HM and DRB and shared features with that seen in patients with Korsakoff's syndrome. We propose that the memory disorder can be explained by malfunctioning in the hippocampal system, secondary to damage in the basal forebrain structures with which it is strongly interconnected. The dysfunction might, in part, be caused by reduction of specific neurotransmitter innervation because the lesions are likely to damage cholinergic neurons and nearby catecholamine pathways within the basal forebrain.", "PMC3248370": "1. The eye lens core (nucleus) has been a valuable source of molecular biologic information. 2. In these studies, lens nuclei are usually homogenized so that any protein information related to anatomical subdivisions, or layers, of the nucleus is lost. 3. The present report is of a new method, indirect tissue electrophoresis (ITE), which, when applied to fish lens nuclei, permitted (a) automatic correlation of protein information with anatomic layer, (b) production of large, clear electrophoretic patterns even from small tissue samples and (c) detection of more proteins than in liquid extracts of homogenized tissues. 4.

There was no change in the length or width of the feet in either group. The mean volume of the feet increased 57.2 milliliters between early and late pregnancy (p less than 0.001) and decreased by only 8.42 milliliters between late pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum.

Of the 6 patients, 5 had the chromophobic hypophyseal adenomas. Of the 5 operated patients 4 remain in satisfactory conditions for 4 to 10 years.

(1) Arachidonate significantly lowered the affinity of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor for R05-4864 and diazepam but did not alter the affinity for PK 11195 and only slightly altered for dipyridamole. In contrast, diethylpyrocarbonate inhibited [3H]PK 11195 binding by 43% while reducing [3H]R05-4864 binding only 16%. (2) Diethylpyrocarbonate treatment causes a reduction in affinity for both dipyridamole and PK 11195, did not change the affinities for R05-4864 and diazepam but increased the affinities for diuretics. PK 11195, R05-4864 and dipyridamole totally protected peripheral benzodiazepine receptors against inactivation by diethylpyrocarbonate. In contrast, diethylpyrocarbonate inactivation of [3H]PK 11195 binding was increased after preincubation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors with metolazone. Arachidonate both lowers the affinity for [3H]R05-4864 and eliminated the ability of R05-4864 to protect peripheral benzodiazepine receptors against inactivation by diethylpyrocarbonate. (3) Among different thiol reagents, only dithiothreitol treatment resulted in 26 and 43% inhibition of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]R05-4864 binding, respectively. These results indicate that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor molecule possesses at least two different conformations or separate mutually exclusive sites for agonists and antagonists. Additionally, the interaction of the thiazide class of diuretics with peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors seems to require binding sites on the receptor molecule in addition to those for specific agonist and antagonist, whereas dipyridamole appears to bind to the antagonist site or conformation.", "PMC1933227": "The biology of oestrogens as applied to the development and progression of breast cancer has been reviewed. Particular consideration has been given to: (i) the sources by which the breast and its tumours may be supplied with oestrogen; (ii) the patterns of endogenous oestrogens within the breast; (iii) the mechanisms by which oestrogens may exert their action; and (iv) the molecular events which follow oestrogen deprivation and which may lead to hormone independence. From a greater understanding of these fundamental processes, novel antioestrogenic measures are being developed which represent more acceptable endocrine treatments for patients with breast cancer and offer the hope of preventative medicine for individuals at high risk of the disease.", "PMC2954893": "Twelve patients presenting with various clinico-pathological syndromes related to chromosomal diseases have been evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. They include patients with trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, 4p-syndrome, 5p-syndrome, and 7p-syndrome. In all these patients karyotype studies were performed demonstrating the chromosomal aberrations. All patients were examined using magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the head and neck malformations which may be specifically associated with their chromosomal anomaly. We were particularly interested in brain abnormalities and the morphological findings correlated with some pathologic anatomical findings. A review of the literature on neuropathological data is reported and compared with the in vivo anatomical results obtained using this highly anatomical non-ionising and non-invasive investigative procedure. Particular interest is paid to trisomy 21 in which all recognizable stereotyped morphological skull and brain malformations are depicted with magnetic resonance and some other malformations demonstrated such as the excessive forward bending and ascension of the brainstem which correlated well with a simian cephalic organization.", "PMC2172117": "This study delineates differences in biologic activity between human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. Human cervical and foreskin epithelial cells were cultured and transfected with recombinant HPV-16 and -18 DNA, resulting in immortalized cell lines. Normal epithelial cells as well as HPV-16 and -18 immortalized cells of both early passages (less than 40 population doublings) and late passages (greater than 180 population doublings) were transplanted in athymic mice. Normal squamous cells formed well-stratified epithelium, while HPV immortalized cells developed either normal-appearing epithelium or typical dysplastic changes. Dysplastic changes were seen in none of the 13 grafts with early-passage HPV-16 cell lines, while 9 of 14 grafts with early-passage HPV-18 cell lines developed dysplasias (P less than 0.0004).

The mRNA contains 1311 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) and encodes a protein of 390 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 41,574. Three small polypeptides were seen in in vitro translation of viral mRNA and hybrid-selected P mRNA, possibly representing internal initiation in the same reading frame of the P protein. A second overlapping reading frame is predicted from the sequence which has a capacity to code for two polypeptides of 56 and 34 amino acids, respectively. Whether these two polypeptides are expressed in infected cells is not known. Comparison of the P protein sequence with that of Sendai virus, measles virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, and canine distemper virus (CDV) showed no distinct homology but comparison with the P protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) showed 25.6% homology.", "PMC2894858": "mit- mutants with genetically defined mutations in the mitochondrial structural genes of the H+-ATPase membrane subunits 6, 8 and 9 were analysed to determine the H+-ATPase assembly defects that resulted as a consequence of the mutations. These include mutants which do not synthesize one of the membrane subunits and mutants which can synthesize these subunits, but in an altered form. Protein subunits which can still be assembled to the defective H+-ATPase in these mutants were determined by immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody to the beta-subunit of the enzyme complex. The results suggest that the assembly pathway of the mitochondrially synthesized H+-ATPase subunits involves the sequential addition of subunits 9, 8 and 6 to a membrane-bound F1-sector. In addition to subunits of the F0- and F1-sectors, two other polypeptides (Mr = 18,000 and Mr = 25,000) are associated with the yeast H+-ATPase. These polypeptides were not observed in the immunoprecipitates obtained from mutants in which the F0-sector is not properly assembled.", "PMC3159451": "A detailed study of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) uptake by in vitro cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages was undertaken. Biochemical quantitations performed over a wide range of HRP concentrations, in the absence or presence of yeast mannan, showed that these macrophages pinocytose HRP by both fluid phase and mannose receptor-mediated uptake. The relative contribution of these two types of endocytosis varied with the concentration of enzyme in the extracellular medium.

The 5' termini of the two subgenomic RNAs have been mapped to positions located 2156 and 936 nucleotides respectively from the 3' terminus of the viral genome. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones encompassing the region of the genome containing both of the subgenomic RNAs has been determined. The sequence data indicate that two nested open reading frames (ORFs) occur in the most 3' proximal location on the genome suggesting that the 0.9-kb subgenomic RNA potentially encodes two polypeptides of 19,397 and 21,610 Da. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of a potential translation product of 41,024 Da encoded by the first ORF of the 2.2-kb subgenomic RNA with the published capsid protein amino acid sequence of the BS-3 strain of TBSV indicates that the 2.2-kb subgenomic RNA encodes the capsid protein. The TBSV coat protein cistron is located internally on the genome and thus its genetic organization differs from that reported for most other small, spherical viruses with monopartite genomes. Amino acid sequence comparisons of analogous regions of the cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) genome confirms a close relationship between the viruses.", "PMC3912159": "It is known that continuous stimulation with LHRH induces a biphasic release of LH. The two pools theory is generally accepted in interpreting this phenomenon. The present study was conducted in order to elicit qualitative differences in LH included in the two pools. Five hundred micrograms synthetic LHRH was infused for 2h in 10 women in various phases of the menstrual cycle and 5 h blood sampling was performed during and after the infusion. Biphasic release of LH was demonstrated in all the cases investigated. The responsiveness to LHRH was most predominant in the midcycle, followed by the luteal phase. Pools of plasma samples at 30-105 min and 150-225 min of the LHRH infusion (plasma pools I and II; corresponding to the initial and the second LH release, respectively) were subjected to isoelectrofocusing (IEF) fractionation, pH range of 3.5-10. LH in plasma was classified in terms of isoelectric point (pI); i.e. A(pI = 9.13), B(8.60), C(8.16), D(7.67), E(7.24), and F(LH species migrating in the acidic pH area). Percentage of high alkaline LH species was significantly elevated in plasma pool I of the midcycle. No phasic difference was observed in the IEF profiles in plasma pool II. Consistent and significant increase and decrease in the percentage of acidic and high alkaline LH species, respectively, were observed throughout the menstrual cycle when the IEF profiles of plasma pool II were compared with those of pool I. The ratio of biological to immunological LH activities (B/I ratio) was markedly depressed in acidic LH species. The highest B/I ratios were obtained in the LH species migrating in the mid-alkaline region. The acidic LH species might represent the young generation of LH molecules prior to acquisition of biological potency. LH species migrating in the mid-alkaline region might be mature and bio-potent forms of the hormone. High alkaline LH species might represent LH molecules over-processed and having lost a degree of biological potency during a prolonged period of storage.", "PMC3001747": "There is increasing evidence that brain cholecystokinin (CCK) peptides function as neuropeptide signals of satiety. Injection of as little as femtomole amounts of CCK-8 into the cerebral ventricles selectively decreased feeding in sheep, and other species (chicken, pig, hamster and rat) also decrease feeding in response to CNS injections of CCK. As would be expected with a physiological satiety agent, CCK-8-induced suppression of feeding interacts in a corrective manner with the energy deficit of the animal, in that the longer the fasting period, the greater the amount of CCK-8 required to suppress feeding. Although it has not been possible to measure changes in concentration of CCK in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with feeding, neutralization of endogenous CCK by administration of CCK antisera into the CSF delayed satiety in sheep. This and other evidence not only supports a physiological role for endogenous brain CCK in feeding behavior, but also suggest that CSF transports CCK to site(s) of action. Little is known of CCK's mechanisms of action, but because CNS CCK also causes changes in both gut motility and secretion of insulin and glucagon, the satiety could result directly from effects on behavior, and indirectly through metabolic changes. Evidence of selective uptake of CCK from CSF suggested involvement of hypothalamic periventricular areas in these functions. Recent findings in sheep of a 60% decrease in CCK content in anterior hypothalamus two hrs after a meal also supports this hypothesis.", "PMC3426416": "Effect of immobilization stress on myocardial ultrastructure has been studied in rats occupying, according to the behavior, dominant, subdominant and \"outcast\" position in the group.

To verify the accuracy of this widening, five distances, two calculations, and four angles were defined and measured in the pathologic group and in a control group of 12 normal children. There was a significant difference (p less than 0.05) between the two groups. A widening of greater than 10 mm between the spinous processes of C1-C2 on a neutral lateral radiograph should alert the physician to an underlying spinal cord injury. The other measurements could then confine the pathology at that level.", "PMC3280868": "Paraneoplastic syndromes are early but seldom appearing remote effects of tumors. In contrast, hematological or hemostaseological tumor signs can be demonstrated nearly in every tumor patient, mostly, however, after prolonged disease. The signs result from interaction between tumor and host, they depend upon the monocyte-macrophage system and are mediated by interleukin-1. Therefore, strictly speaking, they are no paraneoplasias. By genetic instability and increasing heterogeneity, the tumor cell gradually overcomes this defence line and the clinical pictures of different metastatic diseases equalize slowly. Finally, main causes of death are equally occurring infectious and hemostaseological complications. They demonstrate the final breakdown of this defence system.", "PMC2394817": "Recurrent hip dislocation after corrective orthopaedic surgery in children and teenagers with intermediate spinal atrophy has not been reported in the literature. Four cases with long-term follow-up are presented. These represent the only cases surgically treated in 30 years of following spinal atrophy patients. Thus, it seems significant that all hips redislocated after the surgical procedure. In addition, two patients had second operations with subsequent dislocation. Pelvic obliquity should not be the basis for the surgery, as spinal fusion is generally necessary for wheelchair users.

The frequency of infections was found to vary seasonally over most parts of the island, with high infection rates (70 to 100%) in summer and low infection rates (0 to 30%) in winter. In some samples, there was an average of as many as two isolations per animal, and up to five isolations were made from a single animal. By the end of summer, virtually all animals excreted Salmonella spp., with a median rate of excretion of approximately 3,000 Salmonella organisms per g of feces. The seasonal changes occurred over intervals of only weeks. The infections are believed to be associated with disruption of the digestive physiology of the animals caused by the poor quality of feed available in summer. This conclusion was supported by a quantitative study of the infections and by a field manipulation experiment which delayed the initiation of the infections as long as a food supplement was available. The proliferation of Salmonella spp. is discussed in terms of the ecology of the quokka and of the use of Salmonella spp. as indicators of environmental stress acting on the animals.", "PMC1852803": "Microsurgical tissue transplantation initiated a new dimension in breast reconstruction and is the preferred method for carefully selected patients. The inferior gluteus maximus musculocutaneous flap provides abundant tissue for a permanently soft and well-contoured breast with a donor site that is often enhanced by tissue sculpting.

None of the lines tested proved sensitive to NK cells. Three cultured lines were, at most, only slightly sensitive to NC cells; a fourth cultured line was moderately sensitive and became less so, but not completely insensitive, after passage in susceptible hosts. The primary object of these experiments was to test the hypothesis that cultured cell lines which ordinarily fail to grow in normal mice are able to grow after being passaged in a susceptible immunodeficient host because, during this passage, they become resistant to NK or NC cells. This has been shown to occur with one clone, but will not serve as a general explanation because, with other clones, both cultured and mouse-passaged lines were NC-insensitive. The cell-mediated immunity assays confirm our previous conclusion that cultured and mouse-passaged lines of the same clone differ little, if it all, in immunogenicity.", "PMC2691834": "In ultraendurance triathlons, dehydration and electrolyte balance are important factors in race completion and level of performance. Dehydration is the most common reason for a triathlete in the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon to need medical assistance. Hyponatremia is the predominant electrolyte disturbance. We have previously described exercise-induced hyponatremia and documented its incidence as a function of race length and state of hydration. This syndrome, dehydration plus hyponatremia, is extremely rare in races lasting less than 4 h but becomes common in races lasting longer than 8 h.

A sample of 8000 persons was drawn to represent the Finnish population aged 30 yr and over. The first clinical examination (total sample) was made by a specially trained expanded-duty dental auxiliary (EDDA). During the second examination (2-6 months later), 20% of the total sample was reexamined by a dentist, and of those, every 6th patient was examined by the EDDA. Reproducibility of the PTNS was assessed as intra- and interexaminer agreement and was calculated using Cohen's kappa and weighted kappa. The intraexaminer weighted kappa values were 0.67 +/- 0.05 for the PTNS and 0.48 +/- 0.15 for plaque retentions. The interexaminer weighted kappa values between the PTNS registrations were 0.77 +/- 0.05 and 0.74 +/- 0.12 in plaque retentions when examinations were made within 1 day, and 0.53 +/- 0.05 and 0.37 +/- 0.07, respectively, when the interexaminer registrations were made with an interval of 2-6 months between them. The kappa values for intra- and interexaminer reliability reflect quite high reproducibility.", "PMC3507683": "Twenty one cultivars of winged bean (17 of Indian origin and 4 exotic strains obtained from Sri Lanka) were cultivated on marginal (alkaline) soils in the sub-tropics and evaluated for their food value. Whereas the seeds showed wide variations in total protein content (38.1 to 45 per cent), the amino acid compositions were in close proximity to those of soybean. Nevertheless, some strains of winged bean registered higher levels of certain amino acids as compared to soybean.", "PMC4010288": "A rapid, single extraction ELISA for testosterone in plasma is described, using a standard 96 well microtitre plate. Testosterone is covalently bonded to bovine thyroglobulin and passively adsorbed in guanidine hydrochloride to the ELISA plate, giving an immobilised antigen approach which simplifies subsequent assay standardisation for steroid hormone assays. The addition of standard, sample and first antibody (rabbit anti-testosterone), which is unique for each different assay, is followed by a general procedure which includes washing, addition of peroxidase labelled goat antirabbit IgG, further washing and finally, addition of o-phenylenediamine substrate with colour development and reading of the plate at 492 nm on an automatic ELISA processor. The ELISA assay is compared to a testosterone RIA with 125I-label and has similar specificity and precision to the latter with a quicker processing time, and is more cost effective. The added advantages that ELISA assays confer over RIAs in terms of isotope purchase and disposal make this an ideal procedure for use in a routine steroid laboratory.", "PMC3360783": "The enterotoxin B gene of Staphylococcus aureus encodes a single mRNA of about 900 nucleotides. To identify the DNA sequences involved in transcription of the enterotoxin B gene, the transcription initiation and termination sites were determined by nuclease S1 protection experiments. Determination of the enterotoxin B mRNA and protein levels from a number of toxin-producing strains showed that strains that contained relatively low levels of mRNA synthesized low levels of enterotoxin B, whereas strains that carried high levels of enterotoxin B mRNA produced relatively high levels of the toxin protein. Strains carrying the cloned enterotoxin B gene secreted greatly reduced amounts of other extracellular proteins, indicating that the synthesis of several exoproteins in S. aureus is coordinately regulated. An accessory element called agr has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of several exoprotein genes in S. aureus. When the cloned enterotoxin B gene was introduced into strain ISP546 in which the agr element has been inactivated, reduced levels of both enterotoxin B and enterotoxin B mRNA were found. Our results suggest that the enterotoxin B gene is regulated at the transcriptional level and that the agr element plays a role in this regulation.", "PMC3018142": "Inhibition of catecholamine synthesis by alpha-methyl paratyrosine (alpha-MT) was previously shown to potentiate the behavioral suppression caused by dopamine-receptor antagonists. This effect of alpha-MT is in all probability due to inhibition of the compensatory increase in dopamine turnover induced by the dopamine receptor antagonists. In the present study we investigated the effect of the alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine on the haloperidol-induced suppression of food-reinforced lever-pressing behavior (fixed ratio 40:1) in rats. Small behaviorally inactive doses of clonidine were found, in analogy with alpha-MT, to enhance the haloperidol-induced suppression of the lever-pressing behavior. The haloperidol-induced increase in dopamine synthesis (measured as the accumulation of DOPA after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylate) was antagonized by clonidine in the striatum as well as in the dopamine rich limbic regions. Prazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist had no effect on the clonidine induced behavioral changes. Idazoxane, a selective alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, counteracted both the behavioral and biochemical effects of clonidine, indicating that these effects of clonidine are mediated via its action on alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. The present findings provide support for the notion that alpha 2-adrenoreceptors may participate in the regulation of nigro-striatal as well as meso-limbic dopaminergic activity. It is suggested that alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agents, especially in combination with classical antipsychotics, might be of therapeutic value in the treatment of disorders associated with abnormal dopaminergic activity.", "PMC3077288": "In the United States approximately 16,000 CSF shunt operations are performed annually in the treatment of patients with hydrocephalus. Despite a reduction in the incidence of ventricular shunt infections from previous rates of 15 to 30 percent to rates of 5 to 10 percent in recent years, shunt infections remain the most important complication of the treatment of hydrocephalus and contribute significantly to excess morbidity and mortality. Skin flora organisms such as S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and Proprionibacterium are the most common infecting organisms, and the clustering of approximately 70 percent of infections within the 2-month postoperative period strongly suggests that colonization during shunt placement is an important initiating event. In infections caused by S. epidermidis the production of a glycocalyx slime appears to be an important pathogenetic factor. Clinical manifestations of shunt infections are often non-specific, and fever is the only consistent finding. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and a low threshold for diagnostic evaluation are indicated. Needle aspiration of the shunt reservoir or tubing is the single most reliable diagnostic step and is a procedure remarkably free of complications. The most effective treatment regimen is removal of the infected shunt, treatment with effective systemic antibiotics, and replacement of a new shunt in a new site after evidence of CSF inflammation has subsided. Recent preliminary experience combining systemic antibiotics, local instillation of antibiotics into the shunt reservoir or tubing, and revision of the distal shunt appears to offer hope of an effective alternative therapy without total shunt removal. Comparison of this approach to the previous \"gold standard\" in a well-designed prospective study is a high priority. In addition, attempts to reduce bacterial colonization of shunts by development of new shunt materials and the evaluation of newer antibiotics such as the quinolones in the prophylaxis and/or therapy of shunt infections should be encouraged.", "PMC3024789": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), having minimal intrinsic activity, potentiates dopamine-induced fluid secretion in salivary glands of female ixodid ticks. Because the effect of GABA was similar to that of spiperone, we tested whether these two drugs act at a common recognition site. Potentiation was not augmented when salivary glands were exposed to supramaximal concentrations of spiperone (1 microM) plus GABA (100 microM). (+/-)-Sulpiride (100 microM), a spiperone antagonist in this system, also blocked GABA-induced potentiation. Picrotoxin (100 microM) and (-)-bicuculline (100 microM), two GABA antagonists, blocked GABA-induced and spiperone-induced potentiation. Inhibition of GABA by picrotoxin and (-)-bicuculline was noncompetitive. Muscimol (an agonist at GABAA receptors) also potentiated dopamine-induced secretion. Baclofen (an agonist at GABAB receptors) did not elicit potentiation. We suggest that GABA may function as a neuromodulator for dopamine-induced fluid secretion in tick salivary glands.", "PMC3437440": "Inflammatory bowel disease patients with mild to inactive disease were studied for their ability to generate pokeweed mitogen responsive anti-tetanus toxoid IgG producing B cells in the peripheral blood 21 days following in vivo tetanus toxoid booster immunization. Compared to normals and disease controls, patients with inflammatory bowel disease had significantly impaired in vitro production of anti-tetanus toxoid antibody during an 8 day pokeweed mitogen stimulated culture period. There was poor correlation between the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells in the peripheral blood and pokeweed mitogen stimulated antibody production. Likewise, there was little correlation between in vitro antibody production and peripheral blood natural killer cell cytotoxic activity. Culture of the patients B cells with normal T cells failed to improve antibody production in vitro. These results indicate that many inflammatory bowel disease patients have an impaired humoral immune response to tetanus toxoid booster immunization. This impaired immune response may be due to an inability to generate B cell precursors of anti-tetanus toxoid IgG producing B cells rather than to abnormal circulating helper or suppressor T cell activity or natural killer cell regulatory activity.", "PMC3985773": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of isometric strength training of the nondominant left abductor digiti minimi muscles of young and aged women. The ten young subjects, mean age 22.6 years, were all nursing students. The ten older subjects, mean age 69.2 years, did not constitute a similar homogeneous group, although they all lived in the metropolitan area of Richmond, VA. All subjects were volunteers. Training consisted of each subject performing 20 maximal isometric contractions of the left abductor digiti minimi three times weekly for six weeks. A pretest and six weekly measurements of strength were made on a strain gauge. Significant strength increases were found for the pretest-posttest measurements within each group at the same p less than 0.0001 level. When both groups were compared on the initial strength measurement and on the six weekly measurements, no statistically significant differences were found. Therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted.", "PMC4333378": "Two of the three known metabolic pathways to serine and glycine have been shown to be present in prototrophic yeast strains, i.e., the phosphorylated pathway from glycolytic intermediates and the glyoxylate pathway from tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Two serine-glycine auxotrophs (ser1 and ser2) were found to be blocked in the phosphoglycerate pathway. The ser1 gene controls l-glutamate:phosphohydroxypyruvate transaminase biosynthesis, and the ser2 gene controls phosphoserine phosphatase biosynthesis. The other pathway to glycine, from isocitrate, is repressed by growth in glucose media, specifically, at isocitrate lyase and at the alanine:glyoxylate transaminase. This pathway is derepressed by growth to stationary phase in glucose media yielding high activity of these enzymes. The phosphorylated pathway appears to be the principal biosynthetic pathway to serine and glycine during growth on sugar media. Strains which are serine-glycine dependent in glucose media became capable of serine-glycine independent growth on acetate media. These results describe a method of physiological control of a secondary metabolic pathway allowing a single lesion in the principal biosynthetic pathway to produce auxotrophy. This may be termed conditional auxotrophy.", "PMC3919578": "The use of decision analysis is discussed as it relates to pharmacy practice. Decision analysis is a valuable approach to selecting a choice from among several uncertain alternatives.

These choices are incorporated into a decision tree with their probability of occurrence and the relative worth of each potential outcome (utility) to the concerned party. A limitation of the method is that utility values and probabilities are often estimated on the basis of the decision makers' biases.

Analysis of 102 cases of fractures in this manner led to the conclusion that outcome was most often favorable when the fracture was extra-articular whatever the treatment, except in the case of complex compound fractures. In contrast, treatment of articular fractures often required secondary surgery (50% of cases) and led to 20% poor or average results. This was the case whatever initial treatment (functional, orthopedic or operative) had been undertaken.", "PMC2962798": "In the last two decades, the concept of spinal stenosis and its treatment by surgical decompression has been widely accepted. Complications such as olisthy, disc rupture, facet fracture, and intractable back pain began to appear postoperatively, suggesting instability as their cause. A retrospective study of 344 patients treated surgically for lumbar stenosis revealed a 17% reoperation rate for complications resulting from obvious or suspected instability. Sixteen cases of postdecompression olisthy, 14 cases of fresh disc herniation, and 27 cases of intractable back pain required further surgery. Preoperative indicators of potential instability are degenerated discs as evidenced by traction spurs or diminished disc height, olisthy, and scoliosis or asymmetrically narrowed discs. Total facetectomy and pars excision at surgery destabilize the spine and must be added to the preoperative risk factors for instability. Calcified annulus, capsule and ligamentum flavum, or complete disc resorption may offer some protection from postoperative instability. The level of instability may be preselected by the proximity to the intercrestal line. It is recommended that during surgical decompression for spinal stenosis, the posterior elements be spared as much as possible to avoid instability after surgery. Factors suggesting instability noted preoperatively or decompression which produces instability suggest that fusion should be combined with decompression. Spinal fusion is the treatment for postoperative instability.", "PMC1574323": "The authors suggest that the lack of consensus among nurses about important indicators and other measures of quality stems from the lack of consensus on important aspects of nursing care.

To evaluate these suggestions, 83 patients with LBBB who underwent thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within an interval of 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. There were 59 men and 24 women aged 33 to 84 years (mean 65). Myocardial perfusion to the apex, anterior wall and anterior septum were scored qualitatively by consensus of 2 experienced observers and by quantitative analysis in comparison with a normal data base. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of perfusion defects in these segments were then expressed according to angiographic findings. Significant stenosis of vessels within the left anterior descending artery territory was present in 38 patients. By receiver-operator characteristic analysis, a fixed or reversible defect within the apex by the qualitative method was the best criterion for coronary artery disease. However, although highly sensitive (79 and 85% by the qualitative and quantitative methods, respectively), an apical defect was neither specific (38 and 16%, respectively), nor accurate (57 and 46%, respectively). Perfusion abnormalities in the anterior wall and septum were also of limited diagnostic accuracy. Thus, modified interpretative criteria in patients with LBBB are not clinically useful in the assessment of left anterior descending artery disease.", "PMC3314592": "In part 1 of this work we have shown that in each mammalian embryo the nasal fin represents a masked physiological cleft lip and jaw. In this double-layered \"Epithelmauer\" the process of epithelium separation along the differentiation-line may undergo various fates: 1. It can completely fail to take place (resulting in total cleft lip and jaw) or can be interrupted (resulting in incomplete cleft). 2. The persisting oral epithelium of the nasal fin may be loosened and moved away with a little temporal retardation. Thereby the potential osteoblasts and myoblasts cannot meet and join at right time and they retract away from the midline epithelial seam. The minimal and subcutaneous cleft lip and the submucous clefts of the jaw and the mesenchymal bridges may result. 3.

In this report we describe unusual membrane domains which were found surrounding several ameloblast gap junctions. Developing ameloblasts - when examined in ultrathin sections - exhibit gap junctions which appear straight, curved or invaginated. In freeze-fracture replicas, in addition to their typical appearance, several gap junctions were found to be surrounded by a membrane margin which was undulating and devoid of intramembrane particles (IMP's). We believe that these hitherto unreported particle-free membrane margins are associated with the formation of curved or invaginated gap junctions. It is possible that these membrane margins are particle-free because plasma membrane proteins (presumably IMP's) become transiently detached from the cytoskeleton and move laterally. It is therefore likely that these margins are pure lipid domains which are more flexible, thus providing a transient hinge-like mechanism which facilitates the movement required for the formation of the curved or invaginated ameloblast gap junctions.", "PMC2480484": "Enoximone is a selective inhibitor of a low Km, cyclic AMP-specific type of phosphodiesterase (PDE III). In guinea pig and chicken atria, enoximone (0.1-100 mumol/L) caused a weak increase in the force of contraction. The heart rate was slightly enhanced or was unchanged (chicken). Enoximone (30 mumol/L) also failed to shift the concentration-response curves for the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of norepinephrine in guinea pig atria. Under almost the same conditions, enoximone and the nonselective PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) markedly potentiated the forskolin-induced mobilization of choline from phospholipids. The concentrations of IBMX (100 mumol/L) and of enoximone (50 mumol/L) used were equieffective and did not enhance choline mobilization by themselves. Cardioinhibition caused by acetylcholine was unaffected by enoximone. In perfused guinea pig hearts, the release of [3H]norepinephrine evoked by field stimulation (5 Hz) was increased by 50 mumol/L enoximone both in the absence and presence of cocaine plus corticosterone. In contrast, enoximone failed to alter the release of acetylcholine in chicken hearts at rest and during field stimulation (5 Hz), which directly depolarizes the intrinsic post-ganglionic nerves. Similar results were obtained in guinea pig hearts using [3H]acetylcholine. In contrast, when the release of labeled or unlabeled acetylcholine was evoked by (preganglionic) vagal stimulation, enoximone (30 and 50 mumol/L) and IBMX (50 mumol/L) reduced the release in both species. Taken together, enoximone and IBMX apparently reduced ganglionic transmission. The results further indicate functional compartmentalization of PDE III in guinea pig myocardial cells.

Cutaneous temperatures were interpreted by the change in malar thermal circulation index (delta MTCI) method. Both the delta MTCI method and LDV output correlated significantly with the presence of flushing. The delta MTCI method also correlated significantly with LDV output, indicating that the intensity of the flushing reaction can be assessed by both methods. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of a positive result were greater with the LDV method. The time to maximum delta MTCI correlated quite closely with the time to maximum LDV output.

Cells were exposed to 50 microM buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) for 48 h and exposed to DDP for the last 24 h of this time. This treatment protocol sensitized 2008 cells to DDP. The dose modification factor (DMF) defined as IC50 control cells/IC50 GSH depleted cells was 1.6 +/- 0.5 (N = 9). DDP-resistant cells selected by acute, high dose DDP exposure were also sensitized by this treatment; the DMF in the 3-6-fold resistant 2008/DDP cells was 2.4 +/- 1.2 (N = 9). The sensitization was not significantly greater in the resistant cells than in the parent cells (P greater than 0.05). When the rebound of GSH following BSO exposure was reexamined, the GSH levels were found to rise rapidly following trypsinizing and plating. BSO treatment following DDP exposure had no effect on DDP cytotoxicity in 2008 and 2008/DDP cells. These results indicate that simply depleting GSH prior to DDP exposure is not sufficient for sensitizing these cells to DDP. In contrast to the potentiation of nitrogen mustard cytotoxicity, exposure to GSH depletion must be maintained during DDP treatment for enhancement of DDP cytotoxicity to occur.", "PMC3277825": "Three cases are reported of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis in patients who came from the Caribbean or South America and had lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and prior local radiation therapy. The patients had small-bowel obstruction with ileal involvement, mucosal erythema, and friability on colonoscopy with colonic involvement and an exophytic rectal mass with rectal involvement. Review of the 77 reported cases of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis shows that this is a clinical subset of disseminated histoplasmosis. With gastrointestinal involvement, pulmonary symptoms are uncommon and gastrointestinal symptoms predominate. Fever is less common than in other forms of dissemination. The most common lesions are a mass or ulcers, which often mimic inflammatory bowel disease or carcinoma. Terminal ileal involvement predominates in one third. The complement fixation test was positive in about three quarters of cases tested, but the skin test is not diagnostically useful. In one quarter of patients there is other evidence of immunosuppression. In the immunosuppressed, gastrointestinal histoplasmosis must be considered, even in a patient from a nonendemic area, who presents with lesions appearing like carcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease.

The purpose of this study was to see whether other agonists with more receptor selective opioid actions than morphine would also produce this multiplicative interaction. DAMPGO (Tyr-D-Ala2-Gly-NMePhe4-Gly-ol5), DPDPE (D-Pen2, D-Pen5, enkephalin) and U50-488H, opioid agonists highly selective for mu, delta and kappa receptors, respectively, were administered alone i.c.v. or intrathecally (i.t.) or in combination (i.c.v. plus i.t.) to determine ED50 values for the tail-flick response in mice. These ED50 values were examined isobolographically in relation to the theoretical additive ED50 values by the potency ratio method. First, DAMPGO given i.cv and i.t. was similar to morphine, indicating that simultaneous supraspinal and spinal mu agonist administration produce the multiplicative interaction. Second, concurrent administration of DPDPE or U50,488H, i.c.v. and i.t., as well as cross-over combinations of DPDPE at one and U50,488H at the other site, produced additive interactions only. The multiplicative interaction was a property characteristic of mu but not delta and kappa agonists. Based on the similarity between morphine and DAMPGO, it was postulated that both mu agonists act on redundant descending pain inhibitory pathways to produce multiplication. A second mechanism for multiplicative interaction was based on the difference between DAMPGO and morphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3548508": "Intravenous infusions of Escherichia coli endotoxin into sheep caused the appearance in lung lymph of high levels of an enzyme with trypsinlike activity. The time course of appearance of the enzyme and the extent of its increase corresponded to the known events of endotoxin-induced capillary injury. Accordingly, activity was low in the first phase of endotoxin-induced increased lung lymph flow caused by increased pressure filtration but was high in the second phase of increased lung lymph flow caused by increased permeability filtration. Recovery was associated with a decrease of activity to preinfusion levels. Capillary damage and increased permeability filtration induced by air emboli or oleic acid led to a similar increase in lung lymph proteolytic activity. By contrast lung lymph proteolytic activity remained virtually unchanged during increased pressure filtration induced by inflation of a balloon in the left atrium. Activity also remained unchanged in thoracic duct lymph, indicating that the increased activity in lung lymph is not an expression of a generalized response to endotoxin. The enzyme, a serine protease with a molecular weight of about 70,000 to 75,000 and a pH optimum between 7.3 and 7.6, was not related to lymph clotting and was not capable of correcting the clotting defects of plasmas deficient in enzymes of the clotting cascade. These results together with specificity studies indicate that the enzyme represents a new, hitherto unidentified, protease.

Standardization of the cases was done on the basis of Bishop score, parity, success of induction and dose schedules. Gestational ages varied from 37 to 42 weeks. The criterion of successful induction was establishment of labour with at least 5 cm cervical dilatation by 12 hours. All the three drugs gave equally good results and comparable that of oxytocin drip. Vaginal delivery rates were for Pitocin, Sandopart, and Prostin 94.4, 96.7 and 91.9 per cent, respectively.

Schild analysis yielded similar pA2 values for ANAPP3 and adenosine suggesting a common receptor site. Several 3'-ribose-modified adenosine analogs were tested for agonist activity and found to be inactive. Results suggest that ANAPP3 interacts at the presynaptic adenosine receptor of the ileum following its metabolism to adenosine, which explains the lack of antagonism at adenosine receptors of ileal smooth muscle following photolysis of ANAPP3.", "PMC3527565": "The spice capsicum, the fruits of the genus Capsicum (Family Solanaceae), is a very popular food additive in many parts of the world, valued for the important sensory attributes of color, pungency, and aroma. A large number of varieties are widely cultivated and traded. The characteristic carotenoids of the bright red paprika and cayenne-type chillies, the high character impact aroma stimuli, the methoxy pyrazine of green bell capsicum, the esters of ripe tabasco and the highly potent pungency stimuli, and the capsaicinoids of African and other Asian varieties of chillies, have been of great interest to chemists and biochemists. Research workers in other disciplines such as genetics and breeding, agriculture, and technology have been interested in this spice to develop new varieties with combinations of different optimal levels of the stimuli for the sensory attributes and to maximize production of storable products for specific end uses. Physiologists have been intensely studying the action of the highly potent pungency stimuli and social psychologists the curious aspect of growing acceptance and preference for the initially unacceptable pungency sensation. In the sequential review of all these aspects of the fruit spice Capsicum, the earlier two parts covered history, botany, cultivation and primary processing, and processed products, standards, world production, and trade. In Part III, the chemistry, the compositional variations, synthesis and biosynthesis of the functional components, the carotenoids, the volatiles, and the capsaicinoids are comprehensively reviewed.", "PMC2951092": "We have studied the hyperglycaemic effect of the carbohydrate of glucose, sucrose, and honey equivalent to 20 g in twelve normal volunteers, eight patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and six patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Honey produced an attenuated postprandial glycaemic response in normal volunteers (vs glucose p less than 0.005; vs sucrose p less than 0.05) and IDDMs (vs glucose p less than 0.005; vs sucrose p less than 0.05). The glycaemic index (GI) showed considerable variability within each subject group. Combined with a peak incremental index (PI), the two indices appear to be more valuable in predicting the glycaemic effects of carbohydrates rather than either one alone. We suggest that honey may prove to be a valuable sugar substitute in diabetics, and that both the GI and PI should be used in the analysis of food.", "PMC3951269": "This article presents an approach to the diagnosis and therapy of patients with vasculitis. Effective treatment of patients with vasculitis requires a systemic approach to diagnosis and classification of disease, evaluation of the extent of organ system involvement, and an exclusion of underlying treatable diseases.", "PMC2900199": "Somatostatin plays an important role in the regulation of the episodic and ultradian rhythm of growth hormone (GH) secretion. Passive immunization of rats with specific antibodies to the 14 and 28 amino acid sequences caused a significant GH elevation. The fact that somatostatin antiserum was unable to block episodic GH surges indicates that this hormone's release must be regulated by a dual mechanism. Indeed, GH-releasing factor (GRF) seems to be instrumental in the maintenance of pulsatile GH secretion. Moreover, exogenous GRF induced a further GH increase predominantly during the period of active secretion. Neutralization of endogenous somatostatin eliminated this time-dependent effect, indicating that this peptide blocks periodical spontaneous GH release. Food deprivation and changes in glucose homeostasis virtually obliterate the ultradian GH rhythm. In this context, peripheral somatostatin seems to play an important role. Also the central GRF/somatostatin interplay is responsible for a short-loop feedback control on pituitary somatotrops.", "PMC3458752": "To test whether adaptation to sorbitol could be observed in rat plaque, we made pH measurements of rat sulcal plaque in vivo, following topical application of 10% sorbitol solution. Rat pups were inoculated orally with S. mutans 6715 and fed diet MIT 305 (5% sucrose) for 16 days. Baseline sulcal plaque pH response of these rats to topical application of 10% sorbitol solution was measured. One group of 16 rats was then fed 20% sucrose in the diet, and a second group 20% sorbitol. After 13 days' feeding of the experimental diets (four days were used for accommodation to dose, and nine days at the 20% level for sorbitol), there was a significantly greater (p less than 0.01) drop in pH following topical application of 10% sorbitol in this group than in the sucrose-fed group. There was no difference in the pH response of the two groups to topical application of a 10% sucrose solution when tested six days later. The sulcal enamel caries score was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in the sucrose group, but buccal enamel scores were similar in both groups. Adaptation in rat plaque took place, and could be measured in vivo as an increased drop in sulcal plaque pH following topical application of sorbitol. It is not clear whether this adaptation was primarily due to selection of sorbitol-fermenting micro-organisms, or, more likely, by induction of sorbitol-specific enzymes. Relative to the sucrose-containing diet, the sorbitol diet was hypocariogenic, even under experimental conditions.", "PMC4030976": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for determining phylloquinone (vitamin K1) in soy bean oils is described. Resolution of vitamin K1 from interfering peaks of the matrix was obtained after enzymatic digestion, extraction and liquid-solid chromatography on alumina.

The breaking strength was measured in different groups immediately after suture and after 24, 72 and 120 h. Tiopronin (Thiola), soya-bean trypsin inhibitor (STI), or saline solution, was given by continuous intravenous infusion during the test periods. In the saline groups there was a marked decrease in breaking strength at 24 and 72 h. Most of the strength was restored at 120 h. The metalloproteinase inhibitor tiopronin, which in a previous study had diminished the decrease in breaking strength at 24 h, was without effect at 72 h. Rats given STI, which is a group-specific serine proteinase inhibitor, had substantially higher values of breaking strength than saline-treated controls at 24 and 72 h. At 120 h no difference was found. Since the postoperative decrease in breaking strength could be attenuated by proteinase inhibitors, it seems to be due to proteinase activities. STI-treatment did not impair subsequent gain in mechanical strength during the fibroplasia period.", "PMC2809331": "Ischemic heart disease of elderly patients increased markedly and patients with high risk complications become to be candidates for CABG. Emergent CABG was undergone successfully on the high risk patient of 72 years with severe left ventricular dysfunction (EF 14%), old cerebral infarction, renal dysfunction, and Diabetes Mellitus. From this experience, CABG could be safely performed even in elderly patient with high risk, if the complications were avoided carefully. However, the long term problem may be the multifocal VPC due to left ventricular dysfunction including old myocardial infarction.", "PMC3750193": "Two cases of stenosis of the internal carotid artery after blunt craniocervical trauma in children are described. Their neurological symptoms developed a few hours after the injury. A superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was performed in one, and the other was conservatively treated because of the spontaneous resolution of the stenosis. The pathophysiology and treatment of this clinical entity, especially in children, are discussed.", "PMC2787503": "A 6-month-old infant had bullous lesions on his posterior neck, upper trunk, and extremities for two months prior to admission for fever and shock. He had an elevated white blood cell count with left shift and normal platelet count, but abnormal coagulation studies. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics, crystalloids, fresh-frozen plasma, and pressor agents. A histamine H2 receptor antagonist was started for guaiac-positive nasogastric tube drainage. The patient recovered after four days of treatment. A skin biopsy confirmed mastocytosis. A week later the child passed grossly bloody stools with blood clots. No source of gastrointestinal bleeding was identified by extensive work-up. Blood histamine level measured one day before gastrointestinal bleeding was 16,400 pg/ml (normal 263 +/- 202 pg/ml). The bleeding resolved spontaneously. The patient was maintained on cimetidine. Results of a subsequent bone scan were normal. Shock or gastrointestinal bleeding associated with unusual skin lesions should alert the pediatrician to the possibility of mastocytosis.", "PMC3068154": "Dendritic cells were enriched from guinea pig auricular lymph nodes containing Mycobacterium leprae induced granulomas by immunomagnetic depletion of other cells. These cells were strongly positive for major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and labelled with an antidendritic cell monoclonal antibody, but not with an antimacrophage antibody. Interdigitating dendritic cells were identified in the granulomatous lymph node by staining with the antidendritic cell antibody and by transmission electron microscopy. When cultured in vitro with purified T lymphocytes, these cells acted as accessory cells for both purified protein derivative and concanavalin A induced proliferation. Although previous studies have shown that macrophages from these lymph nodes do not act as accessory cells, the present results indicate that dendritic cells from M. leprae granuloma containing lymph nodes may act as antigen-presenting cells.", "PMC3024873": "The circulating levels of ACTH and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) were measured in 9 patients with Nelson's syndrome after the administration of saline, ovine corticotrophin releasing factor (oCRF), bromocriptine or TRH. The concentrations of ACTH were grossly elevated and alpha-MSH levels ranged from undetectable to higher than the normal range. In seven of eight subjects there was a rapid corticotrophic response, but no change in the alpha-MSH level, following oCRF. This response was delayed in one subject. Following oCRF injection, the plasma oCRF profile was variable but circulating oCRF was detectable even at the end of the experiment in all cases. There was no significant change in circulating ACTH or alpha-MSH following either bromocriptine or TRH. Cultured tumour cells from one case of Cushing's disease showed a corticotrophic response but no change in alpha-MSH to oCRF and the response was enhanced by vasopressin. Bromocriptine added to the same tumour depressed ACTH secretion without affecting the output of alpha-MSH. The present data suggest that the tumours in these subjects are responsive to oCRF and arise from corticotrophs rather than melanotrophs.", "PMC4016585": "The results of gross and histopathological study of a near-term male hamster exencephalic lateral cephalothoracopagus are presented. There was minimal duplication of the internal organs to the point of division at the abdomen. The appendicular skeleton was relatively unaffected by the severe malformations of the axial skeleton. The studies suggested that the lateral relationship of the skull to the spinal columns was a consequence of the presence of two embryonic neural tubes; the chordomesodermal systems of the right and left twins apparently contributed the tissues for the right and left cephalic neural folds, respectively. Anomalies of the vertebral bodies and neural arches were not related to failure of closure of the neural tube as there was no evidence for rachischisis in either body half. Rather, the anomalous axial skeletal elements were apparently the result of competing fields of development by two chordomesodermal systems. The twins were recovered from a dam maintained on a diet consisting of 80% cassava, a cyanide-containing staple consumed by humans in tropical countries. Because the numbers of resorbed implantation sites and malformed litermates were low and the failure to produce conjoined twins in other litters recovered from dams given cassava diets, it appears unlikely that the malformation was related to the composition of the diet.", "PMC3069746": "A febrile transfusion reaction caused by strong isoagglutinins in the patients serum is reported. The reaction resulted from a transfusion of group A platelets in a group 0 patient; the recipients' serum contained high titered isohemagglutinin (Anti-A 1:8192) capable of lysing bloodgroup A1 red cells up to a titer of 1:8. Moreover, the serum showed a strong positive thrombocytotoxic reaction with the platelets of the donor and some other group A individuals, but remained negative with group 0, and turned to negative reaction with group A samples after neutralization with bloodgroup substance. We conclude that pretransfusion testing of group 0 donors and recipients for isohemolysins combined with platelet crossmatching may prevent febrile reactions.", "PMC4018081": "Citrate specimens derived from chiral acetates were converted to the CoA derivatives. These were reconverted with citrate synthase to citrates under conditions of either predominating hydrolytic burst or predominating steady-state period. The stereochemical purity of substrates and products was determined. Reversal of the synthase condensation step occurs under both conditions but is markedly increased during the steady-state period. The results indicate that citryl-CoA-derived acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate create the steady-state conditions. The hydrolase state and the ligase/lyase state of the synthase predominate under burst and steady-state conditions, respectively. This result indicates a conversion of the hydrolase state into the ligase/lyase state during the transition.", "PMC4027948": "The pattern of polymorphism in the C-band-positive constitutive heterochromatin of chromosomes #1, #9, and #16 was studied in fibroblasts from 23 unrelated patients with adenomatosis of the colon and rectum and in peripheral lymphocytes from 78 control persons. The parameters of the heterochromatic regions analyzed were relative size, symmetry-asymmetry within homologous chromosome pairs, and frequency of inversions. The polyposis coli patients had a significantly higher frequency (p less than 0.05) of partial and total heterochromatin inversion on chromosome #9 than the control group (37.0% compared with 21.8%). In the other parameters studied, no significant differences were found between patients and controls.", "PMC3717711": "Allergen extracts contain a wide variety of allergenic determinants and the sensitization of allergic subjects is extremely heterogeneous. Specific immunotherapy is usually performed with multiple component extracts and it is therefore important to determine whether this treatment may elicit the onset of newly developed IgE sensitivities. By means of nitrocellulose immunoblotting technique, the IgE sensitivities of 20 patients were characterized before and after specific immunotherapy. Ten patients had a rush immunotherapy with a standardized orchard grass pollen extract and ten others underwent a rush immunotherapy with a 6-grass pollen allergoid. The allergenic profiles of the patients before and after immunotherapy were qualitatively similar. In some patients an increase of orchard grass pollen-specific IgE was observed and the allergenic profile was quantitatively different. These results suggest that rush immunotherapy with either an aqueous non-modified extract or an allergoid does not elicit the onset of new IgE sensitivities. Multicomponent allergenic extracts may therefore be used in the treatment of patients.", "PMC3781940": "During the 19 year period ending December 1984, 4840 strains of Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria were submitted to the National Collection of Type Cultures for identification. Of these, 195 strains (4.0% of the total) were identified as Pseudomonas cepacia which demonstrates both that the species is regularly encountered in clinical material in the UK and that several laboratories have experienced difficulty in identifying the organism. The sources from which the 195 strains were isolated are reported and also the characteristics by which the species may be recognized. The clinical significance of Ps. cepacia is reviewed, and the resistance of this species to disinfectants and antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat pseudomonas infections is discussed to underline the necessity for the precise identification of Ps. cepacia.", "PMC3390107": "This study investigated the psychological stress and psychiatric symptomatology in a representative sample of pilots involved in a labor dispute with management.

After one month, all five patients receiving placebo had to have the study terminated due to a flare of their disease manifested by statistically significant deterioration in multiple clinical parameters. It is concluded that patients receiving long-term methotrexate must continue the drug to maintain clinical benefits.", "PMC3281653": "1. A permeabilized isolated rat liver cell preparation was developed to achieve selective permeabilization of the cell membrane to metabolites and to allow the assay of mitochondrial overt carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I) activity in situ. By performing the digitonin-induced permeabilization in the presence of fluoride and bivalent-metal-cation sequestrants, it was possible to demonstrate that the activity of other enzymes, which are regulated by reversible phosphorylation, was preserved during the procedure and subsequent washing of cells before assay. 2. CPT activity at a sub-optimal palmitoyl-CoA concentration was almost totally (approximately 90%) inhibited by malonyl-CoA, indicating that mitochondrial CPT I was largely measured in this preparation. 3. The palmitoyl-CoA-saturation and malonyl-CoA-inhibition curves for CPT activity in permeabilized cells were very similar to those obtained previously for the enzyme in isolated liver mitochondria. Moreover, starvation and diabetes had the same effects on enzyme activity, affinity for palmitoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT I in isolated cells as found in isolated mitochondria. These physiologically induced changes persisted through the cell preparation and incubation period. 4. Neither incubation of cells with glucagon or insulin nor incubation with pyruvate and lactate before permeabilization resulted in alterations of these parameters of CPT I in isolated cells. 5. The results are discussed in relation to the temporal relationships of changes in the activity and properties of CPT I in vivo in relation to the effects of insulin and glucagon on fatty acid metabolism in vivo.", "PMC2938196": "Several ergot alkaloid derivatives have been tested for their ability to inhibit receptor binding of [3H]spiperone (D2 dopamine receptors) and [3H]dopamine (D3 dopamine receptors) in the bovine caudate nucleus. Dopaminergic activity was correlated to their chemical structure. The potencies of ergot alkaloids for displacing [3H]spiperone binding can be ranked in the following order: lisuride greater than ergosine greater than bromodihydroergosine greater than bromoergosine approximately dihydroergosine approximately ergosinine approximately dihydroergocryptine greater than bromoergocryptine greater than CH-29 717 greater than saccharinoergosinine = saccharinoergosine greater than dihydroergosinine. The potencies of these compounds for displacing [3H]dopamine binding can be ranked in the following order: lisuride greater than ergosinine approximately ergosine greater than dihydroergosine greater than bromodihydroergosine approximately CH-29 717 approximately bromoergocryptine approximately bromoergosine approximately dihydroergocryptine greater than saccharinoergosine, saccharinoergosinine, dihydroergosinine. Displacement of both radioligands was unaffected by GTP. Binding characteristics of ergot alkaloids examined revealed antagonist-like properties of binding to D2 and agonist-like properties of binding to D3 receptors. Introduction of bromine into position 2, selective hydrogenation of 9,10-dihydroderivatives, or isomerization in position 8 of the ergot alkaloid molecule did not drastically change binding parameters of these compounds. However, an alpha-configuration in position 8 combined with hydrogenation of the delta-9,10-double bond of dihydroergosinine, significantly decreased its affinity to both D2 and D3 receptors in comparison with dihydroergosine or ergosinine, suggesting stereoselectivity of dopamine receptors towards the pair dihydroergosine/dihydroergosinine.", "PMC3244994": "In order to study temporal changes in surgical rates for peptic ulcer disease a survey investigation covering 82% of the surgical departments in Sweden was made. Since 1956 there was a marked and steady decline in elective procedures while the decline in emergency procedures for perforations was much less pronounced. In 1986, the incidence of elective and emergency operations was 1.2 and 0.6 procedures per 10,000 inhabitants, respectively.

The procedure was chosen primarily to avoid a diseased or scarred aorta in 41, to allow a staged approach to bilateral renal artery stenoses or multiple vascular lesions in 17, as a \"lesser operation\" for five poor-risk patients, for complex problems including trauma, mycotic aneurysm, aortic dissection, thoracoabdominal aneurysm, and renal artery aneurysm in five, and as the procedure of choice in 11 patients. The perioperative mortality rate was 6% for the 77 patients studied. No hepatic dysfunction was seen. Deterioration of renal function occurred on three occasions but only in patients with bilateral simultaneous repair. Cure or improvement of hypertension was achieved in 52 of 63 patients and renal function preserved or improved in 67 of 77 patients. Long-term functional results remain good during follow-up periods up to 14 years.

One of two experimental groups was allowed 1 month of recovery. After 4 weeks of stress, there was a significant increase in shockinduced fighting, in the activity of serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and in the activity of hypothalamic tyrosine hydroxylase. The concentration of hypothalamic norepinephrine was not decreased. After 4 weeks of recovery, only serum dopamine-betahydroxylase activity returned to normal; it therefore appears that longterm stress may increase central catecholamine synthesis. possibly resulting in a persistent increase in aggressive behavior.", "PMC3121795": "A double-blind crossover study of sodium valproate and placebo was conducted in five patients with Meige syndrome. CSF neurotransmitter studies were performed at the end of each treatment period. GABA levels were not influenced by the administration of sodium valproate. An increase in HVA levels was observed in every patient, which may reflect an increase in central dopaminergic activity. This finding may explain the trend towards clinical deterioration which was observed during treatment with sodium valproate. Sodium valproate appears to be ineffective in Meige syndrome.", "PMC3488092": "To investigate whether runners displayed any of the abnormalities characteristic of patients with anorexia nervosa, we conducted a cross sectional study of 31 high mileage, 18 low mileage runners and 18 non-running controls. Subjects completed a personal data questionnaire, the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) and the Eating Attitudes Questionnaire (EAT), underwent a body image test and a blood sample was obtained for measurement of reproductive, thyroid and adrenal hormones. High mileage runners scored significantly higher infrequency scores on the JPI than sedentary controls but there was no evidence of psychopathology. The high mileage runners also significantly overestimated waist width and there were small but statistically significant differences in EAT scores between controls and the runner groups. Ten of 49 runners had EAT scores beyond two standard deviations above the mean of non-running controls. Serum total, free and non-specifically bound testosterone and prolactin levels were significantly lower in high mileage runners than controls. LH, FSH, cortisol and thyroid hormones were not significantly different. There were no significant differences in any hormone between low mileage runners and controls. displayed no clear abnormalities characteristic of patients with anorexia The results suggested that running may have a chronic effect on serum testosterone and prolactin levels in high mileage but not low mileage runners. Although there was no significant evidence of anorexia nervosa on testing the runners with EAT, the overestimation of waist size provided some evidence of a distortion of body image in the high mileage runners. Runners displayed no clear abnormalities characteristic of patients with anorexia nervosa.", "PMC3486841": "We have shown in earlier studies that the isoxazol derivative, HWA 486, prevents the onset of the adjuvant disease in Lewis rats. The diminished arthritic reaction was correlated with an improved response of lymphocytes to T- and B-cell mitogens, indicating that HWA 486 may have immunomodulating activity. We have further elucidated the activity of this substance in mice and compared it to that of cyclophosphamide (Cy), prednisolone (Pr) and cyclosporin A (CsA). After five days of oral treatment the HWA 486 pattern of response differed from each of the three immunosuppressive agents. Both Cy and Pr inhibited the formation of plaque forming cells (PFC) to sheep red blood cells (SRBC), antibody production to SRBC, mitogen induced lymphocyte proliferation, and the PMA stimulated chemiluminescence of peritoneal lavage cells (PL-cells). CsA and HWA 486 were also inhibitory in the formation of PFC and antibodies to SRBC, yet neither substance affected the LPS induced blastogenesis. HWA 486 differs, though, from CsA in that the T-cell mitogens (Con A and PHA) were able to induce proliferation in lymphocytes obtained from animals treated with this compound. Also, the PMA-induced chemiluminescence from PL-cells was enhanced. The data indicates that HWA 486 has inhibitory activity on T-dependent B-cells, yet does not affect T-independent B-cells, and may not influence T-cell responsiveness. These findings may explain the disease modifying activity of HWA 486 in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats.", "PMC3295651": "The vacuum effect of a surgical suction tip can induce significant artifactual alterations in the connective tissue of specimens removed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The alterations described in this article consist of a surgical suction artifact characterized by the formation of numerous, pleomorphic vacuoles that, on casual microscopic examination, resemble the morphology of traumatized adipose tissue. This artifact occurs when a vacuum draws air into connective tissue and mobilizes connective tissue mucins (acid mucopolysaccharides) that localize within the vacuoles that are formed.", "PMC4041423": "13C NMR is used to detect ionizations within a trypsin-chloromethyl ketone inhibitor complex. The pKa values observed are compared with those predicted by free-energy relationships. For the denatured/autolyzed inhibitor complex, a pKa = 5.26 is observed, which is assigned to the ionization of the imidazole of histidine-57. For the intact inhibitor complex a pKa = 7.88 is determined. This pKa is assigned to the ionization of the hemiketal hydroxyl (pKa = 7.88-8.1) and provides the first direct evidence that the serine proteases are able to stabilize the oxyanion of tetrahedral adducts. Indirect evidence is adduced that the imidazole pK1 of histidine-57 is greater than or equal to 8.1. Line-broadening studies suggest that there may be extra fast exchange line broadening, which could result from rapid tautomeric exchange between neutral and zwitterionic species within the inhibitor complex. The significance of these results for the catalytic mechanism of serine proteases is discussed.", "PMC3245743": "The effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on mechanical and electrical activities of the colonic circular muscle strip of guinea-pig were examined. PGE2, at doses over 10(-7) M, produced an initial contraction, followed by a relaxation, while PGF2 alpha (10(-6) M) produced a tonic contraction. The biphasic response of circular muscle strip to PGE2 was not influenced by atropine, tetrodotoxin, propranolol and indomethacin. PGE2 (10(-6) M) initially increased spike discharges, followed by their inhibition in the colonic circular muscle strip. Verapamil (10(-5) M) blocked PGE2-induced initial contraction but did not block the following relaxation. At low temperature (22 degrees C-27 degrees C) and in the presence of tetraethylammonium (5 x 10(-3) M), PGE2 (10(-6) M) produced a contractile response without showing any relaxation. The present results suggest that PGE2-induced initial contraction may depend on an increase in spike discharges and that the following relaxation may depend on an increase in K-ion permeability in the colonic circular muscle. The reason why PGE2 showed a biphasic response on the colonic circular muscle strip is considered to be a summation of rapid small contraction and of late large relaxation.", "PMC3224362": "A refinement of the method for determining the fraction of CFU-s in the S phase is presented.

Filial and backcross families were derived from the two parent lines. The mode of inheritance of the trait, immune response to challenge infection with N. dubius, was analysed by comparing the levels of infection in the parental, filial and backcross (BC) families of mice. The immunity of the F1 mice was found to be dissimilar to both parents, but was closer to the H value than to the level of immunity in the L mice. The backcross to H progeny showed levels of immunity approaching that of the H mice, whereas only two of four backcross to L families were low immune responders. Analysis of these results indicated that the inheritance of immunity in these mice to challenge infection with N. dubius was quantitative, partially dominant for high immune response, and additive, in nature.", "PMC3283519": "A 65-year-old female with hematemesis due to hemosuccus pancreaticus observed by endoscopy was reported.

After removing the thrombus by angioplasty or after lysing it by streptokinase reocclusion of the artery was observed within a relatively short period of time. Subcutaneous injection of rH reduced the incidence of both primary thrombus formation and reocclusion in dependence on the dose administered. After a dose of rH of 2 mg/kg s.c. arterial thrombus formation was completely prevented and after administering 4 mg/kg s.c. thrombotic reocclusion did also not occur. Comparative studies with heparin showed that similar antithrombotic effects were only achieved at doses of 12 mg heparin/kg s.c. The results obtained suggest a clear potential of rH for prevention of thrombotic reocclusion in clinical states.", "PMC2225439": "The relative importance of the anterolateral (ANTLAT) and posteromedial (POSTMED) papillary muscle (PM) chordae tendineae for left ventricular (LV) segmental wall function was assessed in 12 in situ ejecting canine hearts. Pairs of piezoelectric crystals were placed in the regions subtending PM insertions and the ANTLAT LV free wall to measure wall thickness. After mitral valve replacement with complete preservation of the subvalvular apparatus, chordal attachments to either the ANTLAT PM or POSTMED PM were randomly severed using exteriorized snares, followed by subsequent division of the remaining chordae tendineae. Segmental wall function in each region was determined at each stage by segmental preload recruitable stroke work (sPRSW, slope of the segmental stroke work-end-diastolic wall thickness relation). The order in which the chordae were severed was unimportant (p greater than 0.530 in all regions). When the ANTLAT PM chordae were severed first, there were significant declines in sPRSW without a change in the wall thickness intercept in both the ANTLAT (-71.0 +/- 18.3 vs. -57.7 +/- 16.8 mmHg, p less than 0.05) and POSTMED (-81.8 +/- 23.1 vs. -65.4 +/- 17.3 mmHg, p less than 0.05) PM insertion sites. No further significant reductions in sPRSW in either region were detected after severing the remaining chordal attachments to the POSTMED PM. sPRSW in the ANTLAT LV free wall decreased progressively, reaching statistical significance when both sets of chordae tendineae were divided (-88.3 +/- 14.3 vs. -74.0 +/- 15.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). When the POSTMED PM chordae were severed first, no significant changes in sPRSW or the wall thickness intercept in either region of PM insertion were detected. Subsequent division of the ANTLAT PM chordal attachments reduced sPRSW significantly in both the ANTLAT PM (-65.9 +/- 21.1 vs. -56.1 +/- 22.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and POSTMED PM (-78.8 +/- 24.7 vs. -67.2 +/- 24.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) insertion sites, without a shift in the wall thickness intercept. In the ANTLAT LV free wall, sPRSW again fell progressively, achieving statistical significance only when both chordal attachments were severed (-78.6 +/- 14.8 vs. -62.2 +/- 13.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, division of the chordae tendineae resulted in a decline in segmental LV function not only in the areas subtending PM insertions but also in remote LV regions. Furthermore, the influence of the ANTLAT PM chordae predominated local LV systolic function at both PM insertion sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC1904291": "Self tolerance in the immune system is established by clonal deletion or induction of clonal anergy in immature lymphocytes. In addition, repair mechanisms for self tolerance working in the mature immune system may exist to take care of self-reactive lymphocytes eventually leaking through the central mechanisms. Two possible repair mechanisms for self tolerance, both capable of self/nonself discrimination, are discussed in this article. The first is the so-called veto function, which works on CD8+ T cells.

There was no difference in chromosome migration patterns between different life cycle stages of the T. cruzi strains analyzed. However, the sizes and numbers of chromosomal bands varied considerably among T. cruzi strains. This karyotype variation among T. cruzi strains was analyzed further at the chromosomal level by using multicopy genes as probes in Southern hybridizations. The chromosomal location of the genes encoding alpha- and beta-tubulin, ubiquitin, rRNA, spliced leader RNA, and an 85-kilodalton protein remained stable during developmental conversion of the parasite. The sizes and numbers of chromosomes containing these sequences varied among the different strains analyzed, implying multiple rearrangements of these genes during evolution of the parasites. During continuous in vitro cultivation of T. cruzi Y, the chromosomal location of the spliced leader gene shifted spontaneously. The spliced leader gene encodes a 35-nucleotide RNA that is spliced in trans from a 105-nucleotide donor RNA onto all mRNAs in T. cruzi. The spliced leader sequences changed in their physical location in both the cloned and uncloned Y strains. Associated with the complex changes was an increase in the infectivity of the rearranged variant for tissue culture cells. Our results indicate that the spliced leader gene clusters in T. cruzi undergo high-frequency genomic rearrangements.", "PMC2667441": "The development of numerisation material in radiology currently permits to perform usual cardiovascular tests.

The SV values obtained with both methods (one advocated by the manufacture and another one developed by the authors), are correlated with the SV values obtained with the isotopic method, used as reference. The correlations are satisfactory, approximately 0.79 for all patients of the study, and markedly improve when the injection of the contrast material is performed in the pulmonary artery (approximately 0.95).

The inhibition of PGE1 stimulated cAMP accumulation by the most prostaglandin-specific inhibitor di-4-phloretin phosphate was rapidly established after its addition, fully reversible after a 30 min preincubation period and independent of the presence of calcium.

After tractotomy the subnucleus caudalis n.V. is partially destroyed. Aim of the partial vertical nucleotomy is the interruption between the first and second neuron of the Vth nerve conveying pain and thermal sensibility, but also of the IXth and Xth nerve, which end in the subnucleus caudalis n.V. as well. Tactile and some thermal sensibility in the face is so retained, and anesthesia dolorosa or keratitis neuroparalytica avoided.

A synthetic mammalian peptide, atriopeptin II (2 micrograms/kg), was injected intravascularly into unanesthetized, unrestrained fish prepared for renal clearance studies. The aortic pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine flow rate (V), and urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, and total osmolytes were continuously monitored. Atriopeptin II significantly decreased mean aortic pressure (-12%), GFR (-40%), V (-66%), and the absolute excretion rates of sodium (-47%), potassium (-43%), and total osmolytes (-44%). However, the renal effects of atriopeptin II were temporally dissociated from the vasodepressor effect. Mean aortic pressure decreased quickly and returned to control values approximately 2 h after injection, whereas GFR did not decrease significantly until the third hour after injection. The decreases in renal water and solute excretion in response to atriopeptin could be accounted for by the decrease in GFR, since there were no significant changes in fractional water or solute excretion. Similar decreases in GFR were observed during constant infusions of a lower physiological dose of the peptide (80 pg.kg-1.min-1). The observed antidiuretic and antinatriuretic effect of synthetic atriopeptin in the dogfish contrasts with its putative role as a hormone mediating hypervolemic regulation.", "PMC2375893": "The value of the 12 lead electrocardiogram, serum total creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme, and myoglobin for the early detection of infarction was evaluated within one hour of admission to the coronary care unit in 82 consecutive patients with suspected myocardial infarction. The 51 patients in whom infarction was diagnosed during the first 24 hours after admission had a higher prevalence of ST elevation (64% v 11%), higher median serum myoglobin (136 micrograms/l v 34 micrograms/l), higher serum creatine kinase (77 IU/l v 34 IU/l), and higher MB isoenzyme (7 IU/l v 4 IU/l) than those in whom it was not. Stepwise logistic regression analysis in 70 patients in whom the electrocardiogram and serum myoglobin were suitable for analysis showed that serum myoglobin was the variable most closely associated with infarction, and contributed additional diagnostic information when ST elevation was entered into the model first. Serum myoglobin remained associated with myocardial infarction when patients who had had symptoms for less than six hours were analysed. An algorithm based on a rapid agglutination test for myoglobin and ST elevation on the electrocardiogram gave an accurate diagnosis in 82% of patients.

The implant on the test side was used as cathode and was connected to a subcutaneously located stimulator delivering constant current of either 5 microA, 20 microA, or 50 microA. A corresponding control implant was inserted in the other tibia of the same animal and treated likewise, but was not connected to the stimulator. Distally to each implant, a platinum-iridium screw was inserted into the cortex and connected on the test side to the stimulator to serve as the anode. The results showed a 2.4-fold increase in bone formation with 5 microA. In the 20-microA group, there was 2.6-fold more bone in the test chambers. Direct current (DC) stimulation with 50 microA caused a clear decrease of bone volume, with an average of 48% less bone in the test implants. The results indicate that 5 and 20 microA direct current enhance bone ingrowth into a titanium implant that is used as a cathode.

Employing an animal model of the LAR in rabbits previously developed in our laboratory, 3 phases of experiments were performed to investigate the role of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PML) in the LAR and heightened reactivity. In all 3 phases, airways reactivity to histamine and bronchoalveolar lavage analysis were performed 3 days before and 3 days after bronchial challenge with ragweed extract. In Phase 1, 2 groups of rabbits receiving nitrogen mustard were studied: an immune group received immune serum containing antiragweed IgE, and a control group received nonimmune serum. In Phase II, nitrogen mustard was administered to immune rabbits during aortic occlusion to allow the lungs to be exposed to nitrogen mustard while limiting exposure of the bone marrow to this drug, preventing depletion of PML. In Phase III, both an immune and a nonimmune group of rabbits received nitrogen mustard as in Phase I; however, prior to antigen challenge, they were repleted with a neutrophil-rich population of PML. In all experiments, no group of control (nonimmune) rabbits, whether depleted or repleted of PML, developed an immediate asthmatic response (IAR) or a LAR. In addition, no significant increases in lavage cells or airways reactivity occurred after ragweed challenge. In contrast, those animals receiving immune serum and nitrogen mustard developed an IAR; however, no LAR occurred, and no significant change in airways reactivity was observed.

The data presented demonstrate that thermal injury results in degradation of both 16S and 23S ribonucleic acid (RNA) and in damage to the cell membrane, suggested by leakage into the heating mestruum of material absorbing at 260 nm. When the cells were placed in a recovery medium (Trypticase soy broth), complete recovery, indicated by a returned tolerance to salt and polymyxin, occurred within 2 hr. The presence of a protein inhibitor (chloramphenicol) and cell wall inhibitors (vancomycin and penicillin) during recovery had no effect, whereas the presence of an RNA inhibitor (actinomycin D) effectively inhibited recovery. Further data demonstrated that the injured cells were able to resynthesize both species of ribosomal RNA during recovery by using the fragments which resulted from the injury process.

In the vestibular system, hair cells with a morphology and location more characteristic of type I than of type II cells showed strong immunostaining for vimentin. Supporting cells in vestibular neurosensory epithelium stained with less intensity. These results were surprising because epithelial cells in vivo only rarely express vimentin-type IF.

Membrane preparations also contained two other glycoproteins, GP-80 and GP-55, of Mr 80000 and 55000, respectively. Comparison of guinea-pig xanthine oxidase and butyrophilin with proteins from bovine MFGM by peptide mapping procedures, showed that the two proteins in both species were similar, but not identical. GP-55 may also be related to glycoproteins of Mr 45000 and 48000 in the bovine membrane. The integral and peripheral components of guinea-pig MFGM were identified by treating membrane preparations with sodium carbonate solutions at high pH and by partitioning the membrane proteins in solutions of Triton X-114. By these criteria xanthine oxidase and GP-55 appeared to be peripheral components and GP-80 an integral protein of the membrane. PAS-I and butyrophilin displayed hydrophilic properties in Triton X-114 solutions, but could not be removed from membrane preparations with sodium carbonate. Possible reasons for these ambiguous data are discussed.

In Experiment 1 encoding intentionality was varied between subjects. Young adults performed better than old adults on all tests, but on all tests, both age groups produced a similar pattern of better memory of high expectancy than low expectancy items and showed an encoding intentionality effect for low expectancy items. In Experiments 2 and 3 all subjects were told to intentionally encode only one item from each scene; the remaining items could be encoded incidentally. Young adults performed better than old adults, although again, the pattern of performance of the two age groups was similar. High expectancy and low expectancy intentional items were recalled equally well, but high expectancy incidental items were recalled better than low expectancy incidental items. Low expectancy intentional items were recognized better than high expectancy intentional items, but incidental high expectancy items were recognized better than incidental low expectancy items.

Such cell fractions were obtained from acutely iron-loaded and control rat livers. After lysis with Triton X-100 the preparations were assayed for proteolytic activity against rat liver ferritin (RLF) and denatured bovine hemoglobin (DBH), for buffer-soluble ferritin protein content, total protein and non-heme iron. At pH 3.6 both fractions displayed considerable proteolytic activity (cathepsin D activity) against DBH and endogenous proteins but little activity against RLF. By contrast, proteolytic activity against RLF was maximal at the highest pH tested, 6.5, at which DBH was practically insusceptible. The behavior of proteolytic activity against ferritin at pH 6.5 makes it likely that a single enzyme was involved that acted by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, no more than 2.5% of endogenous ferritin protein in the organelles was buffer-soluble. 41 to 89 hours after an intramuscular dose of 50 mg Fe, given as iron dextran, the non-heme iron content of light lysosomes and siderosomes had increased markedly and the ratio of non-heme Fe to buffer-soluble ferritin protein also became much elevated in the organelles; but the ratio of buffer-soluble ferritin to total protein did not rise significantly.

The percentage of cardiologists treating these patients increased as the complexity of ventricular ectopy increased, as the severity of underlying heart disease increased, as the symptoms increased from completely asymptomatic to palpitations or skipped beats, if the patient experienced dizziness or syncope, and if the patient had complex VPBs or asymptomatic VT after MI. Ninety-eight percent of respondents had patients who experienced exacerbation of arrhythmia with antiarrhythmic drugs. Of the conventional type 1 drugs, the drug of first choice was quinidine for 60%, procainamide for 37%, and disopyramide for 3%. The accepted indications for electrophysiologic testing included survivors of sudden cardiac arrest and patients with symptomatic VT.", "PMC3737474": "The liver of Syrian hamsters was studied after exposure to dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in drinking water for, respectively, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. One additional group of animals was offered DMN for 8 weeks, but maintained for further 8 weeks after removal of the compound. The changes consisted of a narrowing portal venopathy, probably arising, initially, from toxic pylephlebitis, being followed by widespread subendothelial prolapse of hepatocytes encroaching upon the lumen of terminal hepatic veins, which generally were free of inflammatory fibrosing lesions. The venous lesions were unrelated to malignant processes in the biliary duct system, which occurred after 16 weeks. Dilatation of sinusoids and small venules was associated with the presence of prolapsed hepatocytes around their openings into involved larger veins. At the end of 12 and 16 weeks of continuous ingestion of DMN, but also where the agent was withdrawn already at 8 weeks, phlebectasis and transitional stages in the formation of teleangiactatic type of peliosis were demonstrated, probably resulting from progressively impeded blood flow due to partial occlusion by prolapsed hepatocytes in terminal veins. The mechanism enabling hepatocytes to penetrate the venous wall was not clarified. There was no indication of invasive malignancy. Hepatocyte prolapse appeared more likely to result from some unknown mechanism of benign infiltration, promoted by regenerative stimulation. This may have been initiated by mild persistent ischemia due to the demonstrated portal venopathy. No endothelial hyperplasia was seen at any stage of the experiments thus eliminating the probability of peliosis being a source of vascular neoplasia, which has previously been described following more prolonged exposure to DMN. Certain parallelisms of the experimental results with hepatic vascular lesions in man subjected to drug therapy are discussed.", "PMC3409847": "Occipital paroxysmal discharges (OPDs) have been related to a variety of clinical problems. To evaluate associated symptoms and patient outcome, we studied 293 children with OPDs. Follow-up of more than 6 months was available in 141 children. Mental retardation, neurological symptoms, behavior problems, ocular symptoms, and convulsions of various types were present. Eight patients had ictal visual phenomena consistent with the diagnosis of benign epilepsy with occipital spike and wave (BEOSW). In the 141 children with at least 6 months follow-up, 58 had other types of convulsions. Clinical and EEG normalization was observed in 25 and clinical normalization only in 17. The use of antiepileptic drugs did not seem to influence the outcome although seizure control was obtained in 26 patients. In all the cases where follow-up was 9 or more years, clinical normalization was observed. Clinical symptoms in these patients were quite heterogeneous and frequently not ictal. The disappearance of OPDs with increasing age points to their being \"not lesional\" in origin.", "PMC2447895": "Receptor binding studies were carried out to test whether the rat brain phencyclidine (PCP) receptor is part of a K+ channel. [3H]PCP, and two analogs, [3H]TCP and m-amino[3H]PCP, labeled a single receptor on rat brain synaptic membranes. Each compound bound to a similar number of sites (Bmax = 2.7 pmol bound/mg protein); the apparent dissociation constants for these compounds (KD less than 0.3 microM) decreased with increasing temperature. The following observations indicate that the PCP receptor is part of a K+ channel: (1) aminopyridines (AP) and tetraalkylammonium ions blocked [3H]PCP binding; their respective orders of potency, 4-AP = 3,4-diAP much greater than 3-AP, and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) greater than tetraethylammonium much greater than tetramethylammonium, paralleled their abilities to block K+ channels, (2) the order of potency of PCP and its analogs for binding to the PCP receptor, TCP greater than PCE greater than m-amino-PCP greater than PCP greater than PCPY greater than m-nitro-PCP, paralleled their rank order for blocking brain K+ channels, and (3) the stereospecific displacement of [3H]PCP binding by the isomers of the \"sigma\" ligands, (+)N-allyl-normetazocine (NANM) greater than (-)NANM, and (-)cyclazocine greater than (+)cyclazocine, and of the dioxolanes, dexoxadrol much greater than levoxadrol, paralleled their abilities to block brain K+ channels. Reciprocal plot and Schild plot analyses indicated that TBA, (+)NANM and dexoxadrol were competitive inhibitors at the PCP receptor, whereas 4-AP had an allosteric interaction.", "PMC2270835": "The life and work of Milton H. Erickson exerts a considerable influence upon the development of strategic and interactional psychotherapies. In this paper we trace the historical course of Erickson's impact in these areas from his early associations with Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead through his contributions to the ideologies of Jay Haley and practitioners at the Mental Research Institute. We have identified seven philosophical and methodological realms which represent the incorporation of Ericksonian principles into strategic and interactional family therapy models.", "PMC2973814": "The sites of tissue uptake of human lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a] were studied in rats using [3H]cholesteryl linoleyl ether [( 3H]CLE) as a marker. Since rat plasma has no cholesteryl ester transfer activity, the amount of label in various tissues should reflect the quantitative uptake of Lp(a). Isolated Lp(a) was labeled with [3H]CLE by incubation overnight of Lp(a), a source of cholesteryl ester transfer activity (1.23 g/ml infranate of human plasma), and [3H]CLE-labeled Intralipid. Following labeling, the homogeneity and integrity of Lp(a) was shown by agarose electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Intact Lp(a) was injected via the tail vein of rats (120-170 g, n = 4 at each time point), and tissues were collected at various times thereafter (4-48 h). The disappearance curve of [3H]CLE-labeled Lp(a) from rat plasma was bimodal and had an initial rapid t1/2 of 1.8 h followed by a slower component, t1/2 = 13.3 h. Tissue uptake at all sampling times was greatest in liver (28.5% at 48 h of total dpm injected), followed by the intestine (9-12%), with less than 3% uptake by spleen. The small intestine was divided into four segments, and while the 3H radioactivity was similar in the proximal segments, a time-related increase in [3H]CLE was seen in its most distal portion. These studies indicate that the tissue sites of degradation in the rat of human Lp(a) are similar to human low-density lipoproteins (LDL); the increase in label in the distal portion of the small intestine with time may represent [3H]CLE excreted through the bile and absorbed by the mucosal cells.", "PMC3710971": "Phosphorylase activation reverses during prolonged contractile activity. Our first experiment was designed to determine whether this loss of ability to activate phosphorylase by stimulation of muscle contraction persists following exercise. Phosphorylase activation by stimulation of muscle contraction was markedly inhibited in rats 25 min after exhausting exercise. To evaluate the role of glycogen depletion, we accelerated glycogen utilization by nicotinic acid administration. A large difference in muscle glycogen depletion during exercise of the same duration did not influence the blunting of phosphorylase activation. Phosphorylase activation by stimulation of contraction was more severely inhibited following prolonged exercise than after a shorter bout of exercise under conditions that resulted in the same degree of glycogen depletion. A large difference in muscle glycogen repletion during 90 min of recovery was not associated with a significant difference in the ability of muscle stimulation to activate phosphorylase, which was still significantly blunted. Phosphorylase activation by epinephrine was also markedly inhibited in muscle 25 min after strenuous exercise but had recovered completely in glycogen-repleted muscle 90 min after exercise. These results provide evidence that an effect of exercise other than glycogen depletion is involved in causing the inhibition of phosphorylase activation; however, they do not rule out the possibility that glycogen depletion also plays a role in this process.", "PMC2132695": "DNA analysis is playing an increasingly important role in characterising and classifying nematode parasites. Though less emphasis has been placed on utilising DNA elements to study nematodes of veterinary importance, correct diagnosis is, nevertheless, critical to proper treatment and control. The genus Trichinella presents a particularly interesting problem since the level of classification within this genus remains unclear. Herein we discuss the application of DNA analysis to the diagnosis and speciation of the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis, where the study of cloned repetitive DNA elements and ribosomal RNA genes has led to significant advances in the understanding of the species-level systematics of this nematode. Despite advances in the recognition of multiple gene pools within the genus Trichinella, their taxonomic level is still uncertain because of insufficient knowledge regarding intraspecific variation within this genus. The utility of mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal DNA sequence analysis in studying the phylogeny and evolutionary history of parasites within this genus is also discussed.", "PMC3975416": "Idiopathic chronic ulcerative enteritis (ICUE) is considered by some physicians to be a variant of sprue. Two patients being treated at our hospital for nonspecific abdominal symptoms had abnormal findings from a small-bowel series; at surgery, an ulcerating process involving the jejunum was found. Clinical, radiological, and pathological findings in these cases suggest that ICUE is a distinct entity.", "PMC3726529": "Because of the relation between topology and function, there has been much interest in the structural transitions of the various conformations of DNA polymers. The x-ray fiber diffraction analysis system at the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source was used to study the reversible transition between the B and D forms of the synthetic DNA poly[d(A-T)].poly[d(A-T)]. The gradual progression of conformations between these two forms indicates that the DNA double helix does not undergo a change of handedness during this transition.", "PMC2553597": "Spontaneous and induced transmission of oncogenic retroviruses from parents to offspring is well documented in mammals, as exemplified by murine leukaemia viruses. In addition, it is now common knowledge that transgenic mice, carrying viral and cellular transforming genes, can show unusual tumour incidences and can transmit this character to successive generations. The present report deals with the occurrence of tumours in rodents exposed directly in utero to murine sarcoma viruses (MSV). Attention was focused on whether MSV are involved in the etiopathogenetic processes leading to early-life and adult-type neoplasms in mice. According to our data, this is a likely possibility, since, for example, Kirsten MSV (Ki-MSV) induced stage-specific tumours in CD-1 mice, including lung tumours and skin papillomas, following intraembryonal injections on gestation days 8 and 10, respectively. When the injections were given in the second half of pregnancy, however, only capillary angiomas and other vascular malformations of the brain, as well as mesenchymal sarcomas, were induced in the newborn. Harvey MSV (Ha-MSV), a close relative of Ki-MSV, and Moloney MSV (Mo-MSV) were much less dependent on the stage of embryogenesis, and mesenchymal sarcomas were frequently detected in prenatally infected animals. Other MSV viruses, including 3611, J-2 and 4070A, were active carcinogens in a way totally independent of the embryonal stage exposed, and tumours in the progeny ranged from mesenchymal sarcomas to lymphoblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, respectively. We next looked at the possibility that spontaneous tumours of CD-1 mice might result from the interaction of certain chemical carcinogens with developmentally expressed components of the Ki-MSV virus. The experiments conducted thus far have provided dubious results. An example is given by experiments with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). This compound is a powerful transplacental carcinogen in CD-1 mice, where it induces lung tumours. It was expected that by exposing developing mice to Ki-MSV on day 8 of embryogenesis and to ENU late in pregnancy or in newborns, a great increase in the incidence of lung tumours would have appeared in the offspring. However, this did not happen, and the agents behaved as if different cellular targets were involved. Understanding this difference could be very informative and useful in identifying neoplastic factors in mammalian embryos.", "PMC2914638": "Biopsy specimens taken during exploratory laparotomy provided the material for a pathological study of 23 cases of nonsecreting immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (Mediterranean lymphomas without alpha-chain disease). The distinctive pathological feature of immunoproliferative small intestinal disease, i.e., a diffuse lymphoid infiltration, was present in the mucosa and submucosa of all or a major part of the small intestine. It was composed of a low- or intermediate-grade malignant lymphoid proliferation associated in 19 of 23 cases with benign-appearing follicular lymphoid structures. These follicular figures were surrounded and partially destroyed by the lymphoma cells. This association strongly resembles the newly described non-Hodgkin's lymphoma entities of perifollicular or parafollicular cell origin. Gross tumors of the small intestine were found in association with the diffuse lymphoid infiltration in 10 cases. They often constituted foci of lymphoma with a higher grade of malignancy. Mesenteric lymph node involvement was frequent and generally in direct ratio to the severity of intestinal involvement. A comprehensive study of the lesions observed in these cases led to the hypothesis that nonsecreting immunoproliferative small intestinal disease could result from the malignant change of perifollicular B cells; during an initial period the tumoral cells retain circulating and homing properties that explain their infiltrative and extensive method of spreading. The possible subsequent emergence of more aggressive subclones of noncirculating malignant cells could then explain the associated inconstant fungating tumor foci. Further studies using more sophisticated immunohistochemical techniques are necessary to establish the meaning of the hyperplastic lymphoid follicles, the possible etiologic role of benign nodular hyperplasia, the exact identification of the tumor cells, and the relationship of nonsecreting immunoproliferative small intestinal disease to closely related alpha-chain disease.", "PMC3954087": "The cytology of multinucleated spermatocytes and spermatid giant cells in the seminiferous tubules of men with oligozoospermia and of men older than 65 years has been investigated electron microscopically. Two different processes which are responsible for the origin of multinucleated germ cells have been analysed: Defects of the intercellular bridges (IB): they move apart and thus allow the confluence of one clone's cells to symplasms. The confluence of membranes: within one clone the membranes of neighbouring germ cells are dissolved and thus intercellular bridges are found in the cytoplasm of the resulting giant cells. The spermatid giant cells reveal a new organization of the cell nuclei and the cell organelles. Yet they disintegrate in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. The appearance of giant cells therefore is an expression of the germ cell degeneration.", "PMC4030882": "43 patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) were treated over a ten-year period at our hospital. Five (11.6%) had giant cell arteritis (GCA). Although many types of arteritis have been reported, all have pathologic features of elastic degeneration and granulomatous inflammation and may share a common underlying etiology. TAA secondary to arteritis frequently involves the ascending aorta, leading to aortic root dilatation and valvular insufficiency. Three of five of our patients had these findings and had successful surgical repair by combined aortic valve and ascending aorta replacement. Patients with TAA secondary to arteritis should be investigated further, looking for evidence of additional arterial disease. Because corticosteroids have prevented the progression of other types of arteritis, further investigation of their efficacy in the treatment of giant cell arteritis may be warranted.", "PMC3468514": "During investigations of the evolution of experimental laboratory infections of woodchucks (Marmota monax) with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), eight hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were observed, six in newborns and two in young adult animals, all within 17-36 months after infection. The absence of an external cocarcinogenic effect in the well-monitored woodchucks indicates the carcinogenicity of WHV and suggests the same for the genetically and biologically similar human hepatitis B virus (HBV). Laboratory infections of woodchucks with two strains of WHV, not reported here in detail, resembled human and chimpanzee HBV infections histologically and serologically. In these studies, eight woodchucks became carriers of surface antigen of WHV for greater than 1 year. All eight woodchucks developed HCC, indicating a 100% risk of HCC in experimentally infected chronic WHV antigen carriers, which is analogous to the high risk of HCC in human hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. Histologically, the absence of cirrhosis in the examined pericarcinomatous tissue permits recognition of gradual transition from normal parenchyma to neoplastic nodules to HCC of rising anaplasia, indicating a continuum of increasingly more malignant neoplastic stages, as known for chemical carcinogenesis. The HCC developed in carrier woodchucks infected as newborns with only minor, if any, hepatitic changes but is associated with antigen-carrying hepatocytes and sometimes with hyperplastic nodules. This stage was preceded in infected adults by an early, acute, weeks-long hepatitis coinciding with the appearance of surface antigen. These findings are also analogous to typical HBV infection in human newborns and young adults, respectively. At the time of HCC development in all animals with adequate histologic material, an acute recent necroinflammation appeared around the tumor, associated with abnormal hematopoietic cells around and within the tumor. A promoting role in carcinogenesis of this necroinflammation of yet unestablished pathogenesis is being postulated, to be confirmed by determination of the status of the WHV DNA in the HCC and by prospective histologic study of the inflammatory reaction.", "PMC2832003": "The structure of ribosomal RNA in situ can be probed using short, complementary DNA oligomers. As these oligomers bind to exposed, single-stranded regions of rRNA, the stability of the hybridized complex can be assayed. Differences in binding stability between cDNA probes of similar length and composition may be indicative of the presence of competing structure, such as base-paired rRNA regions, tRNA interactions or protein interactions. In this study the degree to which such interactions can be distinguished is studied. It is found that by using suitable controls, interactions between rRNA and tRNA or rRNA can be discriminated to a resolution of one or two bases. This resolution promises to be important in delineating the higher-order structure of the rRNA.", "PMC3257569": "IgD is a surface immunoglobulin, which is coexpressed with IgM on greater than 90% of mature B cells, but its levels in serum are extremely low compared to those of IgM. It role as a surface receptor has been reemphasized by our recent findings that IgD receptors are induced on helper T cells by exposure to IgD and that such cells have immunoaugmenting properties. The present study shows that crosslinking of soluble IgD or of monomeric cell surface IgD is required and sufficient for the induction of T cells bearing receptors for IgD, both in vivo and in vitro. Effective IgD crosslinking in this respect can be obtained with antigen or with heterologous and immunogenic as well as nonimmunogenic allotype-specific anti-IgD. These results reinforce the concept that the induction of T cells bearing receptors for IgD is an integral component of the normal immune response.", "PMC2394782": "Primordial follicles isolated from infant mouse ovaries by enzymatic disaggregation have been transferred to the ovaries of sterile adults. They were transferred after being recombined and incubated in a plasma clot which was inserted either into ovaries which had been sterilized by X-irradiation or into vacant periovarian capsules immediately after ovariectomy. Irrespective of the type of operation, these grafts underwent morphogenesis to form replicas of the normal ovary, which were generally indistinguishable in respect of form, histological appearance and function. The numbers of follicles in these so-called transgerminative ovaries were highly variable, but all stages of follicular maturation up to Graafian stage were represented in most of them, while grafts that had been X-irradiated before transfer were sterile. Ovaries forming from fertile grafts were capable of spontaneous ovulation and the majority of animals carrying them were sexually receptive to males. Mating often resulted in pregnancies and those delivering at full-term produced normal offspring.", "PMC2628391": "The discrepancy in the literature about the immediate results after carotid endarterectomy in the presence of occluded or seriously stenotic contralateral carotid artery, has encouraged a retrospective study on 230 patients subjected to 255 carotid endarterectomies. 63 operations (group 1) were carried out in the presence of occluded contralateral carotid artery (40 operations) or of seriously stenotic contralateral carotid artery (23 operations). In the remaining 192 operations (group 2) the contralateral carotid artery was normal or not significantly stenotic (less than 60% of diameter reduction). The indication for surgery and age and sex distribution were similar in the two groups. No operations were performed during acute stroke. Patients with previous stroke underwent surgery only after at least 1 month from the onset of symptoms, in stable neurological conditions. All the patients were operated on under general anesthesia and with systemic heparinization; the indication for intraluminal shunt was made on the basis of clinical evaluation, of back pressure value and, in 106 operated cases of somatosensory cortical evoked potentials. At the end of every operation, ultrasonographic and/or angiographic instrumental controls were carried out. No statistically significant difference was evidenced in the incidence in groups 1 and 2 of postoperative transitory neurological insufficiency (both 3.2%, P greater than 0.8), of permanent neurological insufficiency (0% and 1%, P greater than 0.9), of mortality because of neurological (3.2% and 1%, P greater than 0.5) and non neurological causes (1.6% and 0%, P greater than 0.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2394785": "Since relatively few spermatozoa are needed for oocyte fertilization during gamete intra-Fallopian transfer (GIFT) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF), these methods have been applied in couples with infertility due to male causes. Forty-six couples with male factor infertility were enrolled in this study and results were compared with those attained in 48 couples treated with the same techniques for other than male causes. Overall, GIFT resulted in 26% ongoing pregnancies. GIFT seems to be particularly successful when the sperm concentration is 20 x 10(6)/ml or more, but sperm motility and/or morphology are poor. Nine pregnancies occurred out of 26 GIFT cycles in 18 cases selected on this basis. The ongoing pregnancy rate after IVF was 16% per patient. The latter treatment should be attempted in male immune infertility and in cases with a low sperm concentration, with or without abnormal sperm motility and/or morphology. In these circumstances, five pregnancies were attained out of 28 cycles in 14 cases. For similar sperm concentrations, the conception rate per cycle attained with techniques of assisted reproduction was more than twice that attained with conventional treatment of male infertility.", "PMC2394784": "In 43 patients without ovaries, endometrial biopsies at day 21 of 75 substituted cycles were studied by light and electron microscopy. The morphology of the endometrium was compared after oral, vaginal or intramuscular administration of progesterone, and correlated with the serum levels of 17-beta oestradiol and progesterone and the pregnancies obtained after oocyte donation. After vaginal application of micronized progesterone, endometrial morphology closely matched that of a natural cycle. This therapy was able to support two ongoing pregnancies. No adequate endometrial response was noted after oral ingestion of progesterone. The maturation of the endometrium after intramuscular injections of progesterone in oil was heterogeneous. It was concluded that the vaginal route for administering micronized progesterone can be advised as the treatment of choice in patients without ovarian function.", "PMC3890501": "Interest in the study and determination of the influence of a genetic factor in the etiology of bronchial asthma was initiated by Cook.

The role of the administrator/manager had been identified as an important one for dental hygienists. In order to develop the skills necessary to obtain a position in management or administration, dental hygiene students should have educational preparation in these areas.

Highly purified material produces no greater irritancy upon injection than 0.9% sodium chloride.", "PMC2553557": "The existence of two different functional receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was first proposed by Gaddum and Picarelli. Aided by the development of radioligand binding techniques, the heterogeneity of 5-HT receptors has become more apparent in the past ten years. There are three main types of 5-HT receptors: 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3. Moreover, 5-HT1 is heterogenous and can be divided into 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C and 5-HT1D subtypes. 5-HT1B is probably related to the 5-HT autoreceptor controlling 5-HT release. Multiple 5-HT receptors are differentially distributed throughout the brain, and the agonist-receptor interaction is altered by physical parameters and chemicals, suggesting that the receptors may be physiologically relevant. Three 5-HT receptor subtypes, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2, have been cloned. All three receptors contain approximately 450 amino acids arrayed as seven transmembrane domains. 5-HT1 and 5-HT1A are coupled to adenylate cyclase positively and negatively, respectively, while 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 are coupled positively to phospholipase C. 5-HT1A is also coupled to the opening of K+ channels in hippocampal pyramidal cells. A number of 5-HT-induced physiological responses have been shown to correlate with the 5-HT receptor subtypes. Based on a number of pharmacological studies, it seems likely that the mode of action of certain psychotropic drugs is closely related to the activity of central 5-HT receptors.", "PMC2586129": "To assess independent risk factors predicting the occurrence of clinically significant acute rejection episodes in the first 6 months after cardiac transplantation, we performed a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Forty-three recipients, undergoing transplantation between September 1986 and May 1988, were eligible for analysis and received standardized, low-dose triple drug maintenance immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone. Immunoprophylaxis was supplemented perioperatively with either a polyclonal (antithymocyte globulin, N = 26) or a monoclonal (OKT3, N = 17) anti-T-cell antibody. Investigated, conceivable risk factors comprised recipient and donor age, ischemic time, perioperative anti-T-cell antibody prophylaxis, recipient preoperative status, underlying disease, previous cardiac operation, and histocompatibility parameter (mismatches for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR, HLA-B+DR, HLA-A+B+DR, and Rh0[D] antigen, HLA-DRw6 positive recipient, and identify for ABO system). Univariate analysis suggested significant influence of the type of antibody used perioperatively (p = 0.0024) and the number of mismatches for HLA-A+B+DR (p = 0.0037) and for HLA-B+DR (p = 0.0043). Stepwise logistic regression yielded the number of mismatches for HLA-B+DR (p = 0.0029) and the type of antibody used perioperatively (p = 0.0031) as being highly significant predictors of acute cardiac rejection. Six-month freedom from rejection was 100%, 41%, and 27% for recipients with two, three, and four mismatches for HLA-B+DR and 59% versus 22% for recipients with polyclonal versus monoclonal antibody prophylaxis. Similar to results with kidney transplantation, these results indicate that a poor donor/recipient match for combined HLA-B+DR loci constitutes an independent risk factor for acute graft rejection in low-dose triple drug immunosuppressed cardiac recipients, which stimulates the potential concept of prospective HLA matching. In our experience OKT3 prophylaxis provides significantly less effective prevention of acute rejection than a comparable course of antithymocyte globulin.", "PMC3749960": "The role of population movement on the persistent transmission of malaria in Rameswaram Island was studied. Majority of the inhabitants of the island are fishermen, who engage in perennial fishing. They move from one coastal place to the other for fishing and stay in temporary camps depending on season and fish availability. Such seasonal fishing camps attract fishermen from the mainland coastal villages also. The parasitological and entomological studies carried out in these places reveal that some of the camps are highly vulnerable to the movement of individuals with malaria infection and highly receptive. Rameswaram being a holy place, receives pilgrims from all over India and Nepal. Plasmodium falciparum cases recorded from the pilgrims of North India indicate the danger of the possible introduction of chloroquine-resistant parasite in the island. Also, a large number of passengers in transit from various countries, many of which are at risk of malaria transmission, stay in the island before or after visiting Sri Lanka.

After 3 hr of incubation, Mi-ADMS removed about 70% of the Cd from Cd-MT, and a new peak emerged which corresponded to that obtained by elution of a 2:1 molar mixture of Mi-ADMS and Cd. Only about 15% of the Cd was removed from Cd-MT by DMSA. After 24 hr of incubation with Mi-ADMS, no evidence remained of the presence of Cd-MT; all of the Cd was recovered in a very high molecular weight fraction and in a fraction corresponding to Cd ion. In contrast, after 24 hr of incubation with DMSA, 25% of the Cd was still present as Cd-MT, while the remainder eluted in a fraction corresponding to a 2:1 molar complex of DMSA and Cd. When Mi-ADMS was administered to Cd-bearing mice which had received an inhibitor of organic anion transport, probenecid (PBC) or sulfinpyrazone (SPZ), prior to administration of the monoester, there was a marked attenuation of the Cd mobilizing actions of Mi-ADMS as reflected in whole body Cd levels. Analysis of organ Cd concentrations revealed that PBC blocked primarily the mobilization of renal Cd by Mi-ADMS, while the principal action of SPZ in antagonizing the action of Mi-ADMS was on hepatic Cd mobilization. It was concluded that Mi-ADMS has a higher affinity for Cd in Cd-MT than does DMSA, and that the access of Mi-ADMS to intracellular Cd is, at least in part, mediated by the organic anion transport system.", "PMC302110": "Forty-three patients (mean age 62 +/- 1 years) were treated for ventricular septal defect (VSD) secondary to myocardial infarction.

However, hemodynamic instability, evidenced by cardiogenic shock, refractory pulmonary edema, or a rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) forced operation in 21 patients within 21 days post-infarct (Group I). In seven patients operation was performed three to six weeks post-infarct (Group II). In only eight patients could operation be delayed beyond six weeks post-infarct (Group III). Clinical deterioration, once begun, progressed rapidly, and could be reversed only temporarily by intra-aortic balloon pumping, used in 26 patients for safe conduct of cardiac catheterization and for peri-operative hemodynamic support. Hospital survival was achieved in 24 of the 36 operated patients (66%). In Group I patients, ten of 21 survived. In Group II, six of seven survived. In Group III, eight of eight patients survived. There have been five late deaths with a mean follow-up of 41 months in survivors. Improved survival has been achieved recently by the greater use of prosthetic material to replace necrotic muscle and by a transinfarct incision regardless of infarct location. Operative mortality before 1973 was 47%; mortality after 1973 was only 18%, with a concomitant reduction of mortality (30%) even in Group I patients.", "PMC3794590": "The effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on compaction of the 8-cell mouse embryo has been investigated. The effects observed depended upon the duration and time of drug application and on the features of compaction scored. Continuous application from the late 2-cell or early 4-cell stages allowed cell flattening and surface polarization to occur in most embryos and advanced development of these features in many of them. Cell coupling developed only when drug addition was delayed until the mid 4-cell stage, and cytoplasmic polarization developed only when drug addition was delayed until the late 4-cell stage. We suggest that control over the timing of compaction is achieved at a post-translational level via a global permissive change within the blastomeres of the embryo.", "PMC4022860": "Thirty-one patients with radiolucent common bile duct stones received medical treatment.

Persistent symptoms and complications settled on conservative management: 8 (25%) patients required admission (2 biliary colic, 1 obstructive jaundice, 4 cholangitis, 1 pancreatitis). One patient died of a myocardial infarction during recovery from pancreatitis; the other continued treatment, 2 achieving complete dissolution/disappearance. Oral dissolution therapy with Rowachol and bile acids should be considered when endoscopic sphincterotomy or surgery is not feasible, but careful attention to potential complications is required while stones persist.", "PMC3737534": "In three trials, broilers were exposed to either moderate-constant or high-cyclic temperatures for 3 days. Broilers in both treatments were exposed to 41 C and high humidity over a 4- to 6-hr period on the 4th day. Blood samples, collected before and at the end of the heat exposure, were assayed for thyroid hormones. Neither acclimation nor severe heat exposure consistently affected triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4) concentration.

(Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, N.J.), and R. Cleeland. Fluorescence and viability of Proteus mirabilis stained directly with fluorescein isothiocyanate. J. Bacteriol. 92:23-27. 1966.-Washed cell suspensions of Proteus mirabilis, under the proper conditions, stained well with fluorescein isothiocyanate with little or no loss of cell viability. The speed and intensity of the reaction was dependent on both the concentration of dye and pH. Within a range of pH 3.0 to 10.0, staining was most rapid at pH 5.0 to 6.0, with a slower and less intense reaction occurring at the other pH values. As the concentration of dye at either pH 5.0 or 9.0 was increased from 10 to 1,000 mug/ml, there was an increase in the rate of staining but a decrease in cell viability. After 24 hr of incubation at 4 C, pH 5.0, and a dye concentration of 10 mug/ml, all cells were stained, the majority exhibiting intense fluorescence with little or no loss of viability noted. In preliminary experiments with Staphylococcus aureus, similar results were obtained. Of various other fluorescent dyes tested, only rhodamine isothiocyanate was found to give satisfactory staining.", "PMC2504292": "NAD+ was the base material for syntheses of coenzyme analogs with reactive groups bound to N6 of the adenine moiety via spacers that are 3-17 A long. These analogs were used for the modification of dehydrogenases. Aromatic imidoesters and acyl azides are suitable reactive groups, which form covalent amidinium or amide bonds with amino acid residues such as the epsilon-amino groups of lysines. The catalytic function of the modified protein decreased only slightly. Coenzymes that are linked via a spacer to carboxyl and amino groups are fixed to the protein by means of carbodiimides and hydroxysuccinimide. Coenzyme-bound aromatic imidoesters with spacer lengths of more than 12 A were incorporated to the extent of 60% at the active site. Aliphatic imidoesters proved to be inefficient for protein modification because of fast hydrolysis. Fixing of coenzyme analogs containing appended carboxyl or amino groups to enzyme in the presence of carbodiimides resulted in a decrease of enzyme activity. Modified lactate dehydrogenase and L-alanine dehydrogenase formed an enzyme reactor for the production of L-alanine in the absence of free NAD+. Both enzymes were cross-linked by dimethyl suberimidate in the presence or absence of NAD+, bis-NAD+, pyruvate, and oxamate.

The binding was inhibited by DL-propranolol (Ki approximately 1 nM). Treatment of cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) without fetal calf serum for 4 days with desipramine reduced the (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 specific binding in a concentration-dependent manner, a reduction from 127 to 102 fmol/mg of protein being found at a ligand concentration of 1 nM after treatment with 10 microM desipramine. Lesser effects were seen after treatment for 1 day. A similar result was found with maprotiline, and reductions in specific binding were seen after 4 days of treatment with amitriptyline, iprindole, and citalopram. The reduction in binding-site density (measured per milligram of protein to compensate for variability in cell density per well), however, was paralleled in all cases by a reduction in the rate of cell proliferation. When C6 glioma cells were cultured in Ham's medium without fetal calf serum during the antidepressant treatment period, a higher specific binding was observed than for the DMEM-cultured cells, and 10 microM desipramine was without effect on either the (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 specific binding or cell proliferation. It is concluded that the effects of the antidepressants tested upon the density of (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 specific binding sites in intact C6 cells may be secondary to the toxicity of the compounds under the conditions used.", "PMC4295869": "Exposure of human red cells to 2 N HCl for 18-20 hr at 110 degrees C appears to release the total fatty acid, which can then be esterified for GLC analysis.

The scintigraphy revealed unexpected extensive inflammation tracking down from the region of the sinus to the lower chest in front and under the heart. Chest X-ray and echocardiographic findings were inconclusive. The value of gallium scintigraphy in this case was not only in the localisation of the lesion but also in defining the extent of inflammation, the latter feature determining the need for reintervention.", "PMC3506601": "To evaluate the prognostic value of the left ventricular response to isoproterenol infusion in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 25 patients, 17 men and eight women, were studied. According to responses of left ventricular function to isoproterenol (0.02 microgram/kg/min), the patients were classified in two groups: the normal response group, in which fractional shortening increased by more than 10% (n = 10); and the low response group, in which fractional shortening increased by 10% or less (n = 15). A follow-up spanning four to 40 months with an average of 21 months disclosed that six patients died, two deteriorated, and six had no change in the low response group, while seven patients were improved, three stabilized, and no one deteriorated or died in the normal response group. There was a difference in the clinical courses of the two groups. Thus, the left ventricular response to isoproterenol proved useful in predicting the course of DCM.", "PMC2743695": "A retrospective review of 4023 thyroid scans performed at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in the five years to February 1987 identified 105 cases of subacute thyroiditis. Subacute thyroiditis accounted for 9.9% of subjects scanned for hyperthyroidism. Eighty-four percent had painful thyroiditis, 6% postpartum thyroiditis, and 10% painless thyroiditis. Follow-up was obtained in 68% of cases, and 11% were taking thyroxine, probably indicating long-term hypothyroidism. Apart from the presence of antibodies in post-partum thyroiditis, no other factor was identified which predicted the development of long-term hypothyroidism. As subacute thyroiditis is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in our community, the authors believe all people with hyperthyroidism should have a thyroid scan unless they have distinctive features of Graves' disease.", "PMC3082870": "A new class of phospholipases A2 that have a lysine at position 49 differ from the more conventional Asp-49 enzymes with respect to the sequential binding of the essential cofactor, calcium, and the substrate, phospholipid, in the formation of the catalytic complex (Maraganore, J.M., Merutka, G., Cho, W., Welches, W., Kezdy, F.J., and Heinrikson, R.L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13839-13843). We report here the complete amino acid sequence of the Lys-49 enzyme from Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus. The sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation of the intact, S-carboxymethylcysteinyl protein and of peptides derived therefrom by cleavage with cyanogen bromide, chymotrypsin, trypsin, and endoproteinase Lys-C. Despite several changes at amino acid residues previously considered to be invariant, the Lys-49 enzymes are homologous to the Asp-49 phospholipases. Homology is especially apparent in the following: 1) the pattern of 14 half-cystine residues, 2) conservation of hydrophobic residues which have been shown to encircle the active site, and 3) conservation of Asp-99 and His-48 which have been implicated in the catalytic reaction itself. These observations together with kinetic and binding data imply that the Lys-49 phospholipases have a catalytic mechanism and a three-dimensional architecture similar to those of the Asp-49 enzymes. Modeling of the Lys-49 enzyme based upon the structure of bovine pancreatic phospholipase reveals that the epsilon-amino group of Lys-49 can fit easily in the calcium-binding site and, moreover, that this orientation of a cationic side chain at position 49 could account for the characteristic and novel feature of the Lys-49 phospholipases, i.e. that they are able to form complexes with phospholipid in the absence of calcium.", "PMC2600739": "A cross-sectional study of one thousand and sixty-five children (508 boys and 557 girls) from the Watertown School System was done in order to determine whether there is a relationship between airway obstruction, palatal vault formation and malocclusion. The age range was 5 to 12 years old with a mean age of 8.5 years. Breathing pattern was based on the lip competency (seal) of each individual. The height of the palatal vault, the Angle's molar classification, cuspid relationship, the anterior and posterior cross-bites, the deep-bites or open-bites were also recorded. Enlarged tonsils were observed and the presence of allergies was noted. High palatal vaults were observed in children with lip incompetency (85.8%), and in children with Class II (73.6%) and Class III (65.3%). Anterior and/or posterior cross-bites accompanied high palatal vaults. From the examined children in this study, 20% presented known allergies.

The relatively low enzyme content was conveniently purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography to a preparation with high activity capable of catalyzing the esterification of about 23,000 nmol of arginine to the cognate tRNA per milligram of enzyme within 1 min, at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4. The turnover number is about 27 s-1. The purification was about 1200-fold, and the overall yield was more than 30%. The enzyme has a single polypeptide chain of about Mr 70,000 and binds arginine and tRNA with 1:1 stoichiometry. For the aminoacylation reaction, the Km values at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C, for various substrates were determined: 12 microM, 0.9 mM, and 2.5 microM for arginine, ATP, and tRNA, respectively. The Km value for cognate tRNA is higher than those of most of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase systems so far reported. The ATP-PPi exchange reaction proceeds only in the presence of arginine-specific tRNA. The Km values of the exchange at pH 7.2, 37 degrees C, are 0.11 mM, 2.9 mM, and 0.5 mM for arginine, ATP, and PPi, respectively, with a turnover number of 40 s-1. The pH dependence shows that the reaction is favored toward slightly acidic conditions where the aminoacylation is relatively depressed.", "PMC2954196": "In humans beryllium is known to cause pulmonary granulomata which are histologically indistinguishable from sarcoidosis. There is some evidence in man that beryllium-induced pulmonary granulomata are immunologically mediated. We set out to develop an animal model to study the immunopathogenesis of beryllium-induced granulomatous lung disease. Beryllium sulfate (BeSO4) was injected intratracheally (i.t.) into F344 rats previously immunized to BeSO4. This results in well-formed, sarcoid-like lung granulomata at 6 weeks post BeSO4. There was a conspicuous presence at 4 weeks post BeSO4 of numerous, perivascularly located Langhans' giant cells which preceded the development of well-formed granulomas at 6 weeks. Rats were sacrificed at 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after i.t. BeSO4. At the time of sacrifice bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed; B and T (W3/25+ helper 0X8+ suppressor/cytotoxic) lymphocyte populations were quantitated and compared to lymphocyte populations obtained from lung tissue. Both B and T cells were significantly elevated in lung tissue post BeSO4. At 4 weeks when granulomata were just developing, a W3/25+ to 0X8+ ratio of 20:1 in lavage and 2:1 in lung tissue was seen. At 6 weeks when granulomata were well-formed there was a predominance of W3/25+ cells in lavage but not in lung tissue. At 8 and 12 weeks, when the granulomata were regressing, lavage fluid still contained a W3/25+ predominance in contrast to lung tissue which contained a predominance of 0X8+ cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3602415": "The release of prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha, thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was measured in isolated human placental cotyledons perfused under high- and low-oxygen conditions. Also the effect of reoxygenation on prostaglandin production was studied. During the high-oxygen period, prostaglandin E2 accounted for 44% and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha for 28% of all prostaglandin release, and the rank order of prostaglandin release was E2 greater than 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha greater than thromboxane B2 greater than prostaglandin F2 alpha. Hypoxia had no significant effect on quantitative prostaglandin release, but the ratio of prostaglandin E2 to prostaglandin F2 alpha was significantly increased. After the hypoxic period during reoxygenation the release of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was significantly decreased, as was the ratio of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha to thromboxane B2. Also the ratio of the vasodilating prostaglandins (E2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) to the vasoconstricting prostaglandins (thromboxane B2, prostaglandin F2 alpha) was decreased during reoxygenation period. With the constant flow rate, the perfusion pressure increased during hypoxia in six and was unchanged in three preparations. The results indicate that changes in the tissue oxygenation in the placenta affect prostaglandin release in the fetal placental circulation.

The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) mimics that action, and in the human erythrocyte, TPA-activated PKC phosphorylates membrane proteins. Although molecular aspects of this process have been investigated, details of the interaction of TPA with plasma membranes remain elusive. Because TPA is hydrophobic, it has been assumed that it associates with the lipid bilayer. However, there is no direct evidence for its transbilayer distribution. Because knowledge of its location would limit molecular models proposed to explain its mode of action, we have used membrane-splitting techniques, based on freeze-fracture of planar cell monolayers, to quantify transmembrane partitioning of [3H]TPA. Under conditions where PKC-mediated phosphorylation was stimulated by [3H]TPA and where more than 90% of the [3H]TPA was associated with the human red cell plasma membrane, two-thirds of the TPA partitioned with the cytoplasmic leaflet after bilayer splitting. This represents the first direct topographic localization of TPA in a biological membrane and supports the hypothesis that the mechanism of TPA activation requires its association with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer.", "PMC2756574": "Alterations in the duration of mitotic cycle phases in X-irradiated Chinese hamster cells CHO K1 after caffeine (CF) treatment are studied. Delays in S- and G2-phases, induced by 1 and 5 Gr of X-irradiation, are partially or completely decreased by 1 mM or 5 mM CF, respectively. When CF is removed from the medium after irradiation, delays in S- and G2-phases are seen again, however long (0-12 hours) CF remains in the medium. The data obtained allow to suggest that since CF results in a radioresistant DNA synthesis, it may also postpone delays in S- and G2-phases, while cells are progressing through the cell cycle.", "PMC3714276": "Measurements of tonic accommodation (TA) were made on 25 subjects using He-Ne laser optometry (HNL), infra-red optometry (IR) and near retinoscopy (NR) under darkroom conditions.

Significant correlations were found between HNL and IR (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) and between HNL and NR (r = 0.81. p less than 0.001). Control studies under cycloplegia indicate that the estimates are not seriously affected by fluctuations in accommodative state.

Three male subjects (31-36 years) performed 60 consecutive, supramaximal bouts of bicycle exercise, each starting every 1 min and having a duration of 8 s (including approximately 3 s of acceleration). The load was estimated to correspond to 200% of VO2-max. Five other subjects (22-27 years) constituted controls. Ultrathin sections stained with periodic acid-thiosemicarbazide-silver proteinate (PA-TSC-SP) clearly revealed a compartmental distribution of glycogen. Glycogen is stored at five topographically, and probably also functionally, different locations. They are the subsarcolemmal, intermyofibrillar, para-Z-disc, N2-line, and H-zone spaces. During the exercise, glycogen from the N2-line and para-Z-disc locations is preferentially utilized. Serial sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate demonstrated that glycogen stores of the type 2 fibres were more depleted than those of type 1 fibres. The implications of the differential intracellular glycogen storage are discussed.", "PMC2718642": "Between 1963 and 1970, 136 cases of mastopathy were recorded from among 558 women who had undergone outpatient breast surgery. These cases were histomorphologically rated and were followed up for periods between 15 and 22 years. Carcinoma developed in nine of 121 patients, accounting for a 7.5-fold cancer risk. The cancer risk was separately calculated for each of the subtypes involved, and variations between groups were remarkably rare. Hence, an eight-fold carcinoma rate for mastopathy I seems to put into question the prognostic value of epithelial proliferation.", "PMC3477317": "Postimplantation rat embryos (Day 10) were exposed in vitro to teratogenic concentrations of 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, an activated form of cyclophosphamide, and phosphoramide mustard, the major teratogenic metabolite of cyclophosphamide. Following a 5-h exposure to these agents, drug-induced DNA damage was assessed by alkaline elution. Both drugs induced detectable DNA cross-linking at teratogenic concentrations. Alkaline elution combined with proteinase K digestion indicated that approximately half of the DNA cross-linking was DNA-DNA cross-linking and the other half was DNA-protein cross-linking. In addition to DNA cross-linking, phosphoramide mustard produced DNA strand breaks and/or alkaline labile sites. However, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide did not produce detectable DNA strand breaks or alkaline labile sites. Our data also indicate that the induction of abnormal morphogenesis by 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and phosphoramide mustard is correlated with drug-induced DNA cross-linking.", "PMC3429931": "Myocardial contrast echocardiography has developed rapidly in the last few years. This paper is a review of this method based on our previous studies performed in 43 closed chest dogs. An injection of 2 ml of an agitated saline-Renografin mixture into the left main coronary artery provided contrast opacification of the entire circumference of the left ventricular myocardium. Contrast injection into the left anterior descending or the circumflex artery resulted in contrast opacification of localized regions of the left ventricle. Contrast injection into the left main coronary artery after a selective coronary artery occlusion resulted in a \"negative\" contrast outline of the corresponding area indicating the underperfused myocardium. The physiological and hemodynamic effects of the intracoronary injection of the contrast material appeared minor and brief. Perfusion defects after coronary artery occlusion assessed by myocardial contrast echo correlated well with those in equivalent sections by monastral blue dye injected into the left ventricle. Furthermore, the extent of myocardial necrosis after five hours of coronary occlusion assessed by myocardial contrast echo correlated well with the area of necrotic myocardium in equivocal slabs. Myocardial contrast washout index (T1/2) measured by digital intensity analysis of successive end-diastolic images was found to be significantly changed in dogs with varying degrees of coronary stenosis. Thus, the measurement of T1/2 appears to be feasible for evaluating degree of coronary stenosis, however, numerous technical problems remain to be clarified.", "PMC3477315": "Thirty patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive lymphoid (20 patients) or undifferentiated (ten patients) chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis were treated with 0.4 mg of vincristine by continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) daily for 4 days; (doxorubicin) 12 mg/m2 of Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) by continuous intravenous infusion daily for 4 days; and 40 mg of decadron daily on days 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 (VAD). Course 2 was given starting on day 24 with the addition of cyclophosphamide 1 g/22. Overall nine patients achieved complete remission (30%) and three attained a partial remission (10%), for an overall response rate of 40%. Four patients expired during induction whereas 14 had resistant disease. Response rate was significantly higher for patients with lymphoid compared to undifferentiated morphology (55% versus 10%; P = 0.05). In lymphoid blast crisis, Calla-positive disease was associated with a higher response rate compared to Calla-negative disease (75% versus 25%; P = 0.08). Eleven patients developed infections, and seven had fever without documented infections. The median overall survival was 29 weeks. Median survival was 43 weeks for patients achieving complete remission and 20 weeks for those with resistant disease. Remission duration was 39 weeks. After primary and salvage therapy, nine patients are alive, six of them in continuous remission for 19+ to 112+ weeks.

Through patient interviews, multidiscipline staff presentations, chief of service surgical and prognostic summaries, and liaison psychiatrists' formulations, group discussions are undertaken. Through such an experience the staff become aware of the patient's feelings and understandings about their illness and care.

Fatty acid composition data show that all inositol phospholipids are enriched in stearic and arachidonic acids to a much greater degree than other cellular phospholipids. Incubation of GH3 cells with radioactive stearate, oleate, arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate or docosahexaenoate also showed that much more stearate and arachidonate were incorporated into inositol phospholipids. In short term incubations with tracer amounts of radioactive arachidonate, incorporation was initially into phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] being labelled at later times. During longer incubations, all of the inositol phospholipids reach equilibrium at about 10 h, and the resulting specific activities of the three fractions were similar. These findings suggest that arachidonate is incorporated initially into PtdIns and that PtdIns is then phosphorylated. There was no release of either arachidonate or eicosanoid products when GH3 cells were incubated with TRH. However, TRH stimulation of 32P-labelled GH3 cells resulted in rapid breakdown of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns4P, with concomitant increases in [32P]phosphatidic acid and [32P]PtdIns. When the [32P]PtdIns was further analysed by argentation chromatography to separate PtdIns molecular species, it was found that tetraenoic (stearate/arachidonate) species accounted for 80% of the stimulated labelling. The selectivity for arachidonate incorporation into inositol phospholipids coupled with turnover of the arachidonate-containing molecular species suggests that inositol phospholipids containing arachidonic acid or the diacylglycerol resulting therefrom may play a vital cellular role in GH3 cells. This role may involve the operation of the PtdIns cycle itself rather than a stimulated release of arachidonate for eicosanoid formation.", "PMC2808184": "Bacteria isolated from purulent processes on the jaws of European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) and from intestinal inflammatory processes in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), bred as laboratory animals have been shown to be phenotypically similar but not identical with Pasteurella pneumotropica.

The model generates simulated metabolic data for individual brain regions in a specified number of subjects, where there are defined functional couplings amongst the regions. Random numbers provide the variability seen in measured metabolic data. Correlational analysis is performed on these simulated data sets. The parameters of the model can be chosen so that simulated and actual metabolic data are very similar. The model demonstrates that the change in the correlation coefficient between normalized metabolic data in two brain regions is related to the change in the strength of the functional association between the two regions. The model also is used to explore the relations between patterns of correlations and the underlying sets of functional couplings. The results indicate that correlational analysis provides more information about regional involvement in neural systems than does region-by-region comparisons of absolute metabolic rates.", "PMC3130887": "The stability of ampicillin, piperacillin and cefotaxime, alone or in combination with either netilmicin or amikacin, was tested by microbiological methods at 29 degrees C (ampicillin, also at 22 degrees C) in an L-amino acid solution specially prepared for newborn infants. In the case of ampicillin, the mean concentration had dropped to 84% of the initial value after 24 hours. This fall is acceptable. Piperacillin and cefotaxime were stable. Admixture of netilmicin or amikacin did not affect the activity of ampicillin, piperacillin and cefotaxime. The concentrations of netilmicin and amikacin were stable for 24 hours.

Subjects entered the study during inpatient treatment and were subsequently followed up for 12 months. Survival analysis disclosed essentially three categories of treatment response: one for noncompliant subjects (0% to 7% abstinent), one for compliant subjects not attaining therapeutic serum lithium levels (31% to 44% abstinent), and one for compliant subjects with therapeutic serum levels (67% abstinent). Two findings led us to believe that therapeutic serum levels of lithium were associated with better outcome over and above a behavioral compliance effect. First, in a dose-response analysis, serum lithium levels and abstinence rates were not linearly associated. Second, all subjects who started lithium carbonate therapy as inpatients were significantly less likely to relapse to drinking during the first month than were placebo-compliant subjects. There was no evidence that depressed alcoholics showed a better treatment response than nondepressed alcoholics or that lithium had any significant impact on the mood or social adjustment of alcoholics. Although the sample size and the difficulties of ascertaining placebo compliance caution against drawing firm conclusions, the data add further support to the hypothesis that lithium has an effect on drinking behavior not related to the treatment of affective symptoms.", "PMC1539026": "The efficacy of different vitamin and electrolyte treatments of drinking water for heat-stressed broilers was studied in two experiments. In Experiment 1, commercial broilers (50% male, 50% female, sexed), were subjected to four drinking water treatments: 1) unsupplemented water (control); 2) B-vitamins plus electrolytes (B+E1); 3) vitamins A, D, and E, B-vitamins plus electrolytes (ADEB+E1); and 4) vitamins A, D, and E and B-vitamins (ADEB). Each treatment group was replicated in eight pens containing 70 birds. All birds were provided ad libitum access to feed through to 43 days of age and subjected to the water treatment from 16 to 21 days and 38 to 43 days. The birds were exposed to the 35 C ambient temperature during the last 72 h of each period. Immune function was tested on the males in each pen while they received the water treatments from 24 to 34 days of age. In comparison with the control, feed conversion was improved 5.6% by ADEB+E1 and ADEB, and body weight gain was improved 6.7% by ADEB (P less than .05). Total and IgG antibody response against SRBC after primary immunization was improved by B+E1; whereas, B+E1 and ADEB treatments improved IgG after secondary immunization. The highest numbers of Sephadex-elicited peritoneal macrophages were found among ADEB-treated birds, but neither adherence nor phagocytic ability of macrophages from either group was affected. Natural killer cells from all except ADEB+E1-treated birds exhibited comparably high tumoricidal activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3607223": "Photon correlation spectroscopy has been used to study capillary waves on black lipid membranes of glycerol monooleate at temperatures above the lipid transition. For the first time the tension and viscosity of solvent-free bilayers have been observed to display a frequency dependence. The variations of both parameters can be accounted for by a Maxwell viscoelastic fluid model having a relaxation time of 37 microseconds. The equilibrium (omega = 0) tension is compatible with literature values. The present results do not suffice to precisely define the specific molecular processes involved, but relaxation times similar to the present are associated with certain phenomena in phospholipid vesicles. Bilayers containing hydrocarbon solvent do not show such relaxation, presumably due to their weaker intermolecular interactions.", "PMC4094531": "The relation between the radiation output of an X-ray applicator and the performance of the X-ray unit is demonstrated. The method of monitoring the compliance of the performance with the radiation output is proposed thereby permitting the standardization of X-ray examinations in various medical institutions.", "PMC3343227": "Previous studies have indicated that at least part of the selection of proteins for degradation takes place at a binding site on ubiquitin-protein ligase, to which the protein substrate is bound prior to ligation to ubiquitin. It was also shown that proteins with free NH2-terminal alpha-NH2 groups bind better to this site than proteins with blocked NH2 termini (Hershko, A., Heller, H., Eytan, E., and Reiss, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11992-11999). In the present study, we used simple derivatives of amino acids, such as methyl esters, hydroxamates, or dipeptides, to examine the question of whether the protein binding site of the ligase is able to distinguish between different NH2-terminal residues of proteins. Based on specific patterns of inhibition of the binding to ligase by these derivatives, three types of protein substrates could be distinguished. Type I substrates are proteins that have a basic NH2-terminal residue (such as ribonuclease and lysozyme); these are specifically inhibited by derivatives of the 3 basic amino acids (His, Arg, and Lys) with respect to degradation, ligation to ubiquitin, and binding to ligase. Type II substrates (such as beta-lactoglobulin or pepsinogen, that have a Leu residue at the NH2 terminus) are not affected by the above compounds, but are specifically inhibited by derivatives of bulky hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Trp, Phe, and Tyr). In these cases, the amino acid derivatives apparently act as specific inhibitors of the binding of the NH2-terminal residue of proteins, as indicated by the following observations: (a) derivatives in which the alpha-NH2 group is blocked were inactive and (b) in dipeptides, the inhibitory amino acid residue had to be at the NH2-terminal position. An additional class (Type III) of substrates comprises proteins that have neither basic nor bulky hydrophobic NH2-terminal amino acid residues; the binding of these proteins is not inhibited by homologous amino acid derivatives that have NH2-terminal residues similar to that of the protein. It is concluded that Type I and Type II proteins bind to distinct and separate subsites of the ligase, specific for basic or bulky hydrophobic NH2-terminal residues, respectively. On the other hand, Type III proteins apparently predominantly interact with the ligase at regions of the protein molecule other than the NH2-terminal residue.", "PMC3861664": "The Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values (AVL) and the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI) were administered to four classes of students upon their matriculation into dental school and readministered during each year until graduation. Over the four years, scores on the economic and political scales of the AVL increased significantly but decreased significantly on the social scale. Female students were more aesthetic than males and less politically inclined. On the MBTI, scores remained relatively stable over the entire four years. However, females were significantly more intuitive and more feeling than males. In general, this sample of dental students, who graduated in 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1982, was quite similar in personality to samples of dental students of the early 1960s.", "PMC3524096": "In order to evaluate renal tubular function, beta 2-microglobulin was measured in serum and urine from 15 patients with severe pre-eclampsia and 13 normal pregnant women. In the pre-eclamptic group, the serum beta 2-microglobulin level was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) and urinary excretion/24h significantly lower (p less than 0.05), than in the normal pregnant group. A positive linear correlation between serum uric acid and beta 2-microglobulin was observed both in the pre-eclamptic group (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001) and in the normal pregnant group (r = 0.58, p less than 0.05). This may indicate that production and renal handling of these two substances are interdependent. Tubular function is reduced in normal pregnancy, whereas increased 'net tubular reabsorption' of uric acid and beta 2-microglobulin occurs in pre-eclampsia. The cause of the observed changes in tubular function is still obscure.", "PMC1890302": "Although DNA is generally considered to be a poor immunogen, recent evidence suggests that DNA from various species differ in their immunologic activity and that bacterial DNA, unlike mammalian DNA, can induce significant antibody responses in mice. To explore further the immunologic activities of bacterial DNA, its ability to stimulate in vitro proliferation of murine lymphocytes was tested. The stimulation of lymphocytes with highly purified ssDNA from Escherichia coli resulted in a dose-dependent response that was maximal at 48 h. Several lines of evidence indicate that DNA, rather than endotoxin contamination, induced this response: 1) LPS at doses equivalent to those detected in the DNA preparation caused significantly less proliferation than the DNA; 2) the response to DNA was insensitive to polymyxin B; 3) pretreatment of DNA with DNase completely abrogated the response; and 4) DNA induced the proliferation of cells from endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice. Furthermore, although DNA from three different bacterial species induced proliferation, mammalian DNA from three species were nonmitogenic. Depletion of T cells from lymphocytes did not reduce proliferation, suggesting that bacterial DNA directly triggered B cell proliferation. These studies provide further evidence that DNA are not uniform in their immunologic activities likely because of their content of nonconserved structural determinants.", "PMC3549807": "A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted to determine the relative efficacy and safety of topical minoxidil solution for progressive male pattern baldness. One hundred fifty men with a discernible vertex balding spot were randomly assigned to treatment with either 2% topical minoxidil, 3% topical minoxidil, or placebo. After 4 months, patients receiving placebo were crossed over to 3% minoxidil. The study was concluded after 12 months of treatment, at which time 100 subjects were evaluable. Efficacy was determined primarily by objective hair counts at monthly intervals and by subjective patient evaluations at 4 and 12 months. Patients applying active medication had significantly greater growth of nonvellus hairs at 4 months than did their placebo counterparts (p = 0.0018 for 2% minoxidil vs placebo; p = 0.0167 for 3% minoxidil vs placebo). In patients crossed over from placebo to 3% minoxidil, the rate of growth of nonvellus hairs increased to fifteen hairs a month during the next 4 months and slowed to ten hairs a month during the last 4 months. Within-group analyses for month 12 evaluable patients demonstrated significant increases in total hair counts for all three groups (p less than or equal to 0.0001). According to investigator evaluations at month 12, 82% of the 2% minoxidil group, 78% of the 3% minoxidil group, and 83% of the placebo to 3% minoxidil group had new hair growth. Clinically insignificant minoxidil blood levels resulted from scalp absorption.

Two hundred and eighty three (58%) patients had acquired heart disease, 91 (19%) had congenital heart disease, and 114 (23%) had normal hearts. Sixty six patients with normal hearts had innocent systolic murmurs and one had recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The overall prevalence of false tendons was 25% compared with 1.6% in a retrospective analysis of 763 cross sectional echocardiograms. When patients with innocent murmurs were excluded from statistical analysis, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of these tendons between children and adults, boys and girls, men and women, or between patients with acquired or congenital heart disease and normal patients. The prevalence of false tendons in patients with dilated left ventricles (57%), however, resembled that seen in necropsy studies. The prevalence of false tendons in patients with an innocent systolic murmur was 76% in children and 40% in adults, with an overall prevalence of 52%. False tendons are a common echocardiographic finding of no clinical importance except for their possible role in the genesis of innocent murmurs and ventricular arrhythmias. The echocardiographic detection of false tendons increases considerably when these structures are specifically sought and in conditions that result in left ventricular chamber dilatation.", "PMC3495643": "Thymosin-alpha 1 increased the capability of nu/nu mice to produce interleukin (IL)-3 but not IL-2 when administered intraperitoneally at doses of 0.5 and 5.0 micrograms/kg twice a week for 3-6 weeks. Thy-1-positive cells were responsible for the production of IL-3, which was determined by proliferation of the IL-3-dependent cell line (FDC-P2) as well as by augmentation of the in vitro growth of hematopoietic stem cells (colony-forming unit S [CFU-S]). The IL-3 activity released by nu/nu splenocytes emerged in fractions coincidentally with IL-3 released by WEHI-3 cells on Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography. However, IL-2 activity determined by proliferation of the IL-2-dependent cell line was not detected in any fractions of the same chromatography. These findings indicate that IL-2 is not always coproduced with IL-3 by Thy-1-positive cells. This suggests, taken together with results from previous studies about the cells producing IL-2 and IL-3 by other investigators, that thymosin-alpha 1 exerts its effect at an early stage of T cell differentiation to induce a T cell subpopulation capable of producing IL-3 (but not yet IL-2). Based on the present findings, we discuss the mechanism of action by which thymosin-alpha 1 exerts its diverse effects in immunosuppressed hosts but not a potentiating effect in healthy normal animals or in in vitro assays of T cell function.", "PMC3199120": "Selected monocarboxylic esters of aliphatic diols that contained an alicyclic group in the acyl portion of the molecule were effective repellents for Aedes aegypti, Anopheles quadrimaculatus and An. albimanus when tested on cloth.

Anopheles quadrimaculatus was especially susceptible to this type of structure; 112 of the esters provided greater than 21 days of protection and 56 provided greater than 100 days of protection. Aedes aegypti was moderately susceptible to these repellents; 72 esters provided greater than 21 days of protection. Anopheles albimanus was the most difficult mosquito to repel.

The isolation procedure involved chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, CM-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite columns. The final purification of this protein was obtained by affinity chromatography on an ATP-Sepharose column. Because of the extreme lability of the mutant protein, the yield was very poor. Silver stain analysis of the sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoretograms indicated that the affinity-purified protein was better than 90% pure. From the studies of the physical and biochemical properties, the following characteristics of the purified wild type and the mutant protein have been established. The two proteins were indistinguishable by their molecular weight, amino acid composition, and isoelectric point. Purified mutant EF-3 was rapidly inactivated between 37 and 39 degrees C. Under this condition, wild type EF-3 was completely stable. Ribosome-dependent GTPase and ATPase activities of the mutant EF-3 were heat sensitive; GTPase activity was more labile than the ATPase activity. Mutant EF-3, after exposure to a nonpermissive temperature, failed to stimulate binding of the ternary complex of EF-1 X GTP X aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosome. The wild type protein was fully active under this condition.

Patients were evaluated before and after the administration of 1 g acetazolamide (ACZ) by means of a rotating four-detector single-photon emission computed tomograph (SPECT) and inhaled Xe-133. RCBF values in mL/minute/100 g were derived from eight cortical regions of interest (ROI), and from the whole transverse section as a measure of whole brain flow (WBF). ROI/WBF ratios were calculated for each ROI in paired determinations done before and 15 minutes after the administration of ACZ. Results were compared with those previously obtained in a study of 15 normal, healthy volunteer subjects. ROI/WBF ratios greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for a given ROI in the normal group were regarded as probably abnormal, whereas ratios greater than 4 SD below the mean were considered definitely abnormal. After ACZ administration, the number of ROI greater than 2 SD below the normal mean decreased significantly in the AD group and was unchanged in the stroke patients. However, the number of ROI/WBF ratios greater than 4 SD below the normal mean fell in the AD group and rose in the stroke group, with the difference in behavior highly statistically significant. Thus, the response of low-flow areas to ACZ differs in AD and in stroke, which could be of ultimate diagnostic significance.", "PMC2920069": "This paper assesses different methods of asking about alcohol consumption in the antenatal clinic. Reliable screening methods are essential if appropriate intervention is to be accurately targeted. Women attending antenatal clinic for the first time were questioned about their alcohol consumption in the period immediately before confirmation of pregnancy. Quantity-frequency questions, a question about bingeing and the Cage Questions were asked as part of the routine clinical history by the interviewing doctor. In addition, the women were given a further self-completed questionnaire which contained more detailed questions about the usual quantity and frequency of drinking beers, wines and spirits, the Cage Questions again and the Brief Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (BMAST). Asking simple quantity-frequency questions coupled with a question about bingeing during the clinical history was shown to be a quick and efficient method of estimating alcohol intake. Self-administered questionnaires were shown to be unnecessary and although the Cage Questions performed better than the BMAST, these alcoholism screening tests were found to be unreliable in this population in which drinking was generally at a low level.", "PMC4028798": "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been shown to occur in three different forms in the human adult cataractous lens: a membrane bound form (M) and at least two cytosolic isozymes: I1 and I2.

In the present study we found a reduction in forebrain cholinergic neurotransmission indices in 24-month-old Wistar-Kyotos but not in Brown-Norways as compared to their respective young (3-month-old) counterparts. Also only in Wistar-Kyotos dopamine uptake was reduced in the aged striatum, but in the septum it remained unchanged in both strains. In Brown-Norways, age-related changes were observed only in choline acetyltransferase activity and only in brain regions known to contain mainly cholinergic nerve cell bodies. We conclude that at 24 months of age, reductions in brain cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission are more prominent in the highly stress-reactive and shorter-lived Wistar-Kyoto strain, and may be genetically determined.", "PMC3292424": "Liver transplantation has provided individuals with cholestatic disorders a chance for long-term near-normal quality and quantity of survival.

To determine which codon is utilized as an initiator in B. subtilis, we constructed a fusion gene in which the promoter and NH2-terminal region of the spoOA gene was connected to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat gene). After introduction of the plasmid carrying the spoOA-cat fusion gene into B. subtilis cells, the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography. The sequence of NH2-terminal amino acids of the fusion protein was determined and the result established that the GTG codon is utilized as an initiator in B. subtilis. Comparison of the amino acid sequences revealed a marked homology between the spoOA (NH2-terminal half) and spoOF proteins. A less striking but significant homology was also found between the spoOA (COOH-terminal half) and spoOB proteins.

In the fertile group, significantly more subjects had adequate SFA, SPA, or MPT results than in the infertile group. When the two groups were subdivided into those with normal or those with abnormal SFA, no differences were noted in SPA, MPT, or postcoital test (PCT) scores. The SFA parameter most consistently reflected in the results of the SPA, MPT, and PCT was sperm density. This was most evident when the SFA was poor. The worst prognosticator of fertility was the SFA, with 30% of the fertile donors having an abnormal SFA. The worst prognosticator of infertility was the MPT, with 79% of the patients penetrating in the fertile range. The SPA was a significantly better predictor than either the SFA or MPT.

Ovulation was found to be spontaneous and occurred only from the right ovary. The corpora lutea appeared to be functional, and decidual reactions developed in the uterus during the luteal phase of the cycle even in the absence of an implanting blastocyst. At the end of nonpregnant, ovulatory cycles much of the endometrium became necrotic and was desquamated with associated bleeding. In the event of pregnancy only a single blastocyst implanted in the right uterine horn, and the discoidal chorioallantoic placenta then developed at the cranial end of that horn. This was preceded by the development of an unusual vascular tuft in the endometrium in that region. The endothelial cells of the tuft vessels became hypertrophied during early pregnancy and developed more prominent basal laminae. Trophoblast then grew preferentially around these vessels. These observations suggest that factors secreted by endometrial endothelial cells and incorporated at least in part into their basal laminae may play a central role in controlling early trophoblastic growth during the morphogenesis of the discoidal chorioallantoic placenta in this bat.", "PMC3406662": "This paper reviews 16 selected patients reporting for acute acoustic trauma (AAT).

Eight patients received pharmacological treatment with low-molecular-dextran intravenously, papaverin perorally and prednisolone perorally. The high-frequency pure-tone average (3-4-6 kHz) was more affected than the pure-tone average (0.5-1-2 kHz). In 2 patients, the converse was true. The most affected frequencies were 3, 4, and 6 kHz. The initial maximum hearing loss varied between 15 and 70 dB. In 6 patients, extra-high-frequency audiometry (8-20 kHz) was performed and in all patients an asymmetry was demonstrated.

In higher eukaryotes, a single endopeptidase has yet to fulfill the necessary criteria as the physiologically relevant convertase. The observation of proalbumin circulating in a child with a bleeding disorder caused by an unusual alpha 1-antitrypsin mutation led to speculation that the presence of this alpha 1-antitrypsin mutant was inhibitory to the convertase. This provided an additional means of characterizing the processing enzyme. In this study the yeast KEX2 enzyme, a calcium-dependent thiol protease, was found to have all the properties expected for this processing enzyme.

The rate of basal gastric bicarbonate secretion in 24 healthy subjects was 386 +/- 31 mumol/h (mean +/- SEM). The 95% confidence interval for basal bicarbonate output was 103-669 mumol/h. Vagal stimulation by sham feeding increased the bicarbonate output by 63% and instillation of 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 increased the bicarbonate output by 214%.

Forty eight rats were divided into three groups of 16 animals, each group being further sub-divided into eight animals having intestinal resection and eight having intestinal transection. Group 1 was given somatostatin to suppress enteroglucagon, group 2 was given bombesin to stimulate enteroglucagon and group 3 (control group) had neither peptide. All animals were killed 12 days after operation. Circulating enteroglucagon and crypt cell production rate (CCPR) in the terminal ileum were measured. After administration of somatostatin (group 1) both CCPR and plasma enteroglucagon were lower after resection than controls (group 3) (p less than 0.001). Transected rats receiving somatostatin showed a reduction in both plasma enteroglucagon and CCPR, but only the fall in enteroglucagon was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Transected rats receiving bombesin (group 2) had raised plasma enteroglucagon and CCPR compared with the control group (group 3) (P less than 0.005) but there was no significant further rise in these already raised parameters in resected animals. This study indicates that cell proliferation in the rat small bowel after surgery can be influenced by regulatory peptides. The changes in enteroglucagon corresponded closely with changes in CCPR, and this peptide remains a favoured candidate for the humorally mediated trophic influence on the small bowel.", "PMC2559988": "The influence of receptionists on continuity of care in four group practices was examined.

The study population comprised 314 Danish dental offices (participation rate 94%); 177 from the public Child Dental Service (CDS) and 137 from private practice. A minor questionnaire and five biologic indicators (Attest Biological Indicator for Steam Sterilization, 3M) were sent to the participants. CDS offices were found more inclined to use biologic indicators than PP offices (P less than 0.00001). Among CDS autoclaves 2.3% (95% confidence limit: 0.9-5.7%) failed to sterilize compared to 7.3% (95% confidence limit: 4.0-12.9) of the PP autoclaves. This difference is not statistically significant, but the confidence intervals indicate a possible true difference in favor of a better outcome in the CDS offices. Looking at the whole sample no other predictor variable for inadequate sterilization could be determined as differences were statistically insignificant with regard to years of professional experience, age and brand of autoclave, and use of biological control.

In quiet, undisturbed infants, AFP (mean +/- SEM) was similar in groups 1 (9.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg) and 2 (8.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg); with crying, AFP increased significantly in both groups. During laryngoscopy in group 1, AFP increased to 33.5 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, which was significantly greater than in the quiet infant, but did not differ significantly from measurements in the crying infant. In group 2, AFP increased significantly to 15.8 +/- 18 mm Hg during laryngoscopy. This increase was significantly less than the group 1 response. Neither heart rate nor systolic arterial pressure changed significantly in either group during laryngoscopy--when compared with measurements in the quiet state. It was concluded that AFP increases significantly during intubation and during crying in the infant. The response to intubation is only partially attenuated by the prior administration of general anaesthesia.", "PMC3616728": "We retrospectively compared elective cesarean hysterectomy and vaginal hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Sixteen patients had cesarean hysterectomy and 53 had vaginal hysterectomy. There were no deaths in either group and no neonatal complications in the cesarean hysterectomy group. Major and minor complications were comparable in the two groups except that urinary tract infection was statistically more common in the cesarean hysterectomy group. The mean hospital stay for the two groups was comparable. The estimated blood loss and transfusion rate were higher in the cesarean hysterectomy group. The transfusion rate was probably artificially increased because of overzealous intraoperative transfusion. Elective cesarean hysterectomy does not cause unacceptably high morbidity, and it is an acceptable alternative to interval vaginal hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in poorly compliant patients.", "PMC2559980": "The effects of iron deficiency on the aerobic pathway of energy metabolism were studied using mitochondria isolated from epithelial cells from the hamster cheek pouch. A statistically significant reduction in the concentrations of cytochromes aa3, b and c (P less than 0.05), a reduction (P = 0.064) in cytochrome cl and altered cytochrome ratios were found in the mitochondria of iron deficient compared to normal animals. State 4 respiration was demonstrated in the mitochondria of both normal and iron deficient animals but state 3 respiration could not be demonstrated; this suggests uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation which may be an artefact associated with the separation of epithelium from its connective tissue. Nevertheless we conclude that the reduction in cytochrome concentration is a real effect of iron deficiency which may explain, at least in part, the reduction of both energy production and cell proliferation seen in oral epithelia under these conditions.", "PMC3569449": "Retrospective and prospective questionnaire and lung function data, collected during seven population health surveys over 18 years in Busselton, Western Australia, have been analysed for 92 subjects with asthma and 186 normal subjects. Subjects who had a minimum of four observations over an 18-year period were selected; the age range at first study was 22-69 years. Individual regression analyses of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), adjusted for height, on age were used in analyses. Subjects with asthma had a greater rate of decline in FEV1 (p less than 0.01) and a lower baseline lung function (p less than 0.001). The mean loss of FEV1 in males of 1.7 m height was 50 ml/year in nonsmokers with asthma compared with 35 ml/year in the normal subjects. The effect of asthma was variable and not all subjects with asthma had steep rates of decline. There were insufficient numbers of smokers with asthma to draw conclusions about an effect of cigarette smoking additional to the effect of asthma. No relationship was found between rate of decline of FEV1 and age or atopic status. In subjects with asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which was measured at the end of the study, accounted for 9% of the variation in rate of decline of FEV1 and airflow limitation, measured by FEV1 FVC, accounted for 10%. Further studies are needed to determine whether the steep rates of decline found in subjects with asthma are preventable.", "PMC4041460": "Starvation of CHO-K1 cells for leucine leads to a 3-4-fold increase in transport system L activity, without modification of transport through systems A and ASC. The concentration of leucine must be below 10 microM before the enhancement of transport can be clearly seen. To achieve low concentrations of leucine such as 10 microM, extensive dialysis of fetal calf serum was required. The enhancement of transport was completed after 12-24 h of starvation and was fully reversed within 1 h of re-feeding with leucine. Starvation for isoleucine, valine or phenylalanine also produced an increase in system L transport activity, but the effect was only one half of that seen following leucine starvation.", "PMC3058826": "Chloroform extracts of M. leprae suspensions--crude, partially purified and purified--were prepared by standard methods. Similar extracts were also prepared from the livers of normal armadillos using the same methods that were used to prepare crude and partially purified M. leprae suspensions. The only chloroform extract that supported the growth of M. paratuberculosis was the one prepared from Percoll gradient-purified M. leprae. Other four extracts not only did not support the growth of mycobactin-dependent M. paratuberculosis, but also inhibited the growth of mycobactin-independent strain of M. paratuberculosis. These results suggest the presence of mycobactin-like substance in M. leprae, and also, the presence of other unknown substance(s) in the crude suspensions of armadillo livers that inhibits the growth of M. paratuberculosis.", "PMC3561961": "Over a 1-year period, a cystic bluish coloration developed in the most medial aspect at the margin of the right upper eyelid of a 40-year-old man. The clinical diagnoses were either a conjunctival inclusion cyst or an adnexal cyst, possibly of the gland of Moll. The excised specimen was studied histopathologically and exhibited a lining that was virtually indistinguishable from that of the normal canaliculus, except for hyperplasia of the cellular wall and the focal presence of a superficial mucin-producing columnar cell monolayer at the lumen. The medial edge of the excised specimen showed a merging of the cyst into a nonectatic portion of the canaliculus. Inflammation in the wall of the cyst and in this terminal portion of the canaliculus was not identified. This is believed to be a unique entity of an idiopathic ectasia with mild epithelial proliferation of a segment of the canaliculus. The authors have termed this condition canaliculops, to draw a parallel between it and ectasia of the ducts of the lacrimal gland, so-called dacryops.", "PMC2943111": "The role of the nerve in maintaining the ultrastructural integrity of avian muscle spindles was investigated by denervating the pigeon's extensor digitorum communis for periods of 10, 19, and 28 days. The equatorial region of control intrafusal fibers had a reduced density of myofilaments. Sensory endings contained mitochondria and structures resembling synaptic vesicles, and were associated with satellite cells. In the polar region, fibers had a high concentration of myofilaments; small motor endings, unlike sensory endings, lay outside of the fiber's basal lamina. The outer capsule consisted of thin, tightly layered cells which gradually became reduced in number distal to the equatorial region. In both equatorial and polar regions the capsule became more disrupted with longer denervation periods, and lysosomes and phagocytes became more abundant. The equatorial region of denervated fibers contained many myofibrils and some had peripherally-located nuclei, unlike the controls; sensory terminals were absent. The polar region of some fibers had disorganized myofilaments and others had a reduced myofilament density. Fiber diameters increased significantly in both regions. Thus, denervated intrafusal fibers lost some characteristics which distinguish them from extrafusal fibers.", "PMC3716924": "The rat uterus contains two classes of specific nuclear estrogen binding sites which may be involved in estrogen action. Type I sites represent the classic estrogen receptor (Kd 1 nM) and type II sites (Kd 10-20 nM) are stimulated in the nucleus by estrogen under conditions which cause uterine hyperplasia. Dilution of uterine nuclear fractions from estrogen treated rats prior to quantitation of estrogen binding sites by [3H]-estradiol exchange results in an increase (3-4 fold) in the measurable quantities of the type II site. Estimates of type I sites are not affected by dilution. These increases in type II sites following nuclear dilution occur independently of protein concentration and result from the dilution of a specific endogenous inhibitor of [3H]-estradiol binding to these sites. The inhibitor activity is present in cytosol preparations from rat uterus, spleen, diaphragm, skeletal muscle and serum. Preliminary characterization of the inhibitor activity by Sephadex G-25 chromatography shows two distinct peaks which are similar in molecular weight (300). These components (alpha and beta) can be separated on LH-20 chromatography since the beta-peak component is preferentially retained on this lipophilic resin. Partial purification of the LH-20-beta inhibitor component by high performance liquid chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis suggest the putative inhibitor activity is not steroidal in nature and consists of two very similar phenanthrene-like molecules (molecular weights 302 and 304). Analysis of cytosol preparations on LH-20 chromatography shows that non-neoplastic tissues (uterus, liver, lactating mammary gland) contain both alpha and beta inhibitor components whereas estrogen-induced rat mammary tumors contain very low to non-measurable quantities of the beta-peak inhibitor activity.", "PMC3124363": "Current methods of capsular ligament surgery of the knee joint are not sufficient stable. Tensions of unloaded movements of the knee joint are appropriate to destruct again the reconstructed capsular ligament mechanism. Immobilisation is required. Additional capsular ligament plastics produced out of absorbable materials (Polyglactin, Polydioxanon) protect safely the reconstructed capsular ligaments from destruction. Early functional treatment is practicable. The ligament plastics seem to stimulate the nature of origin of ligament-similar tissue. The plastic ligaments will be broken down to natural substances byx hydrolysis. An additional surgical excision is not required. Ligament plastics out of Vicryl are recommended.", "PMC3038850": "Myxobacterial hemagglutinin (MBHA) is a major developmentally induced protein that accumulates during the period of cellular aggregation in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. It has been shown that this lectin is targeted to the cell surface and periplasmic space of developmental cells, suggesting that it may play a role in cell-cell recognition or agglutination. We have cloned the structural gene for MBHA by using synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides containing sequences deduced from the amino acid sequence of MBHA and have used the cloned gene to construct strains of M. xanthus that cannot synthesize MBHA. We found that although the MBHA-deficient strains are delayed in their developmental time course, they are otherwise able to aggregate and sporulate normally. Our results suggest that MBHA may function to increase the efficiency of fruiting-body formation but is not a critical component of cellular aggregation.", "PMC3524795": "Three new cases of renal failure due to lymphomatous infiltration of the kidneys are described and the clinical features of 14 similar patients in the literature are reviewed. The diagnosis of renal failure secondary to lymphomatous infiltration was made by ruling out other causes of renal failure and demonstrating prompt improvement in renal function after systemic chemotherapy or local irradiation of one or both kidneys. Histiocytic lymphoma was the most common underlying disease. In the setting of diffuse lymphoma with other causes of renal failure reasonably excluded, radiographic demonstration of enlarged kidneys without obstruction suggests the need for intensive combination chemotherapy in most cases.", "PMC3749244": "Stereoselective synthesis and biological properties of PAF-acether, its enantiomer and some analogues of both are reported.

This phenomenon is a potential cause of delayed crack formation and propagation in ceramic or metal-ceramic restorations. For dental ceramics, the influence of microstructural defects such as porosity or fissures caused by incomplete sintering is not known. The objectives of this study were to characterize the influence of porosity (produced by underfiring) on the crack propagation resistance of two feldspathic porcelains and to determine whether lower stress corrosion susceptibility or higher fracture toughness accounts for the superior thermal shock resistance of one of these ceramics. We underfired bars of each porcelain, 25 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm, by as much as 84 degrees C below their recommended firing temperatures. After polishing the specimens through 0.05 microns alumina, we induced cracks in their surfaces with a Vickers microhardness indenter. Semicircular cracks, which were produced under an applied indenter load of 19.6 N, grew with time during storage in distilled water at 37 degrees C. Underfiring of both ceramics caused a slight increase in fracture toughness and a relatively small change in pore volume fraction until we underfired the ceramics at 30 degrees C or more. The crack propagation data indicate that the higher thermal shock resistance of one of the ceramics--as measured previously by a water-quench technique-may be due to its greater resistance to stress corrosion at the initial stage of crack propagation.", "PMC3879970": "The nucleotide sequence of two cloned rat lens beta-crystallin cDNAs pRL beta B3-2 and pRL beta B1-3 has been determined. pRL beta B3-2 contains the complete coding information for a beta-crystallin, designated beta B3, of 210 amino acid residues. pRL beta B1-3 is incomplete at its 5' end; the 5' codogenic information which is not present in this cDNA clone was deduced from the cloned gene. pRL beta B1-3 codes for a beta-crystallin polypeptide, designated beta B1, whose full length is 247 amino acid residues. Considerable sequence homology is noted between the amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of each protein. The two rat beta-crystallins show a substantial sequence homology with each other (60%) as well as with the published sequences of rat gamma-crystallin (37%) and bovine and murine beta-crystallins (55 and 45%). All these proteins have a two-domain structure which, like the bovine gamma II-crystallin, might be folded into four remarkably similar protein motifs. Our data further indicate that the beta-crystallins can be subdivided into two groups which are evolutionarily related. Both groups are, although more distantly, also related to the gamma-crystallins.", "PMC3809587": "The relevance of DNA-index, alone and in combination with other parameters, was assessed for patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix by using the method of flow cytometry (FCM). Tumours with a diploid or a tetraploid DNA-content appeared to be associated with a less favourable prognosis than was observed in the group with non-diploid/non-tetraploid tumours. DNA-index in combination with either the age of patients or the histological grade of tumours, enabled the separation of prognostically different subgroups. Particularly, the combination of an age under 51 years with a DNA-index of 1 or 2 appeared to define a group with a low survival rate. Furthermore, within the group of well and moderately differentiated tumours, it was possible to identify prognostically different subgroups by combining this parameter with DNA-index, i.e. a non-diploid/non-tetraploid DNA-content of these tumours was associated with a more favourable prognosis. From this study it is concluded that FCM clearly contributes to the recognition of subgroups of patients with different prognosis.", "PMC3715437": "The frequency of venous thrombosis during central vein catheterization was prospectively studied in a group of 51 patients (53 catheterizations) during a 10-month period. 12 catheterizations (23%) resulted in thrombosis as revealed by phlebography. Of these, 11 were due to catheters whose site of entry was the upper limb. No other favoring factors (osmolality of the infused fluids, length or catheterization etc.) were detected. Ideally, to avoid thrombosis, central venous catheters should be inserted via the jugular or the subclavian vein, while bearing in mind that these other routes are not devoid of complications either.", "PMC3181866": "Biomechanical properties and collagen formation in the granulation tissue of cellulose sponges, implanted subcutaneously in male rats for 7, 10 and 16 days, were tested after treatment with biosynthetic human growth hormone given subcutaneously in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day. At each implantation period, one group started hormone treatment at the day of implantation and another group started hormone treatment 7 days prior to implantation. After 7 days of implantation, increases in maximum stress (36 per cent), relative failure energy (48 per cent) and strain at maximum stress (25 per cent) were found when treatment was started 7 days prior to implantation. After 10 days of implantation an increase in relative failure energy (60 per cent) was found when treatment was started 7 days prior to implantation. No differences were found after 7 and 10 days of implantation when treatment was started at the day of implantation. After 16 days of implantation, no influence on mechanical strength was found in any of the hormone treated groups. The collagen deposition after 7, 10 and 16 days did not differ in any of the hormone treated groups compared to controls.", "PMC3495972": "Injury to the peroneal tendons is one of the major long-term complications of intraarticular calcaneal fractures and heretofore has been difficult to diagnose by noninvasive radiography. Retrospective review of CT scans of 24 intraarticular calcaneal fractures, obtained shortly after injury, identified 22 cases (92%) of acute peroneal tendon abnormalities. In most of these cases, multiple findings were present. These included lateral displacement in 14 (58%) of 24, impingement by bony fragments in eight (33%), subluxation or dislocation in six (25%), soft-tissue masses around the tendons representing hematomas or early scar tissue in five (21%), and entrapment of the tendons in three (13%). In 10 cases with long-term follow-up, impingement on the tendons by bony fragments correlated well with the subsequent development of peroneal tenosynovitis, while hematoma around the tendons or lateral displacement of the tendons was clinically insignificant. Thus, CT in the immediate postfracture period, can be used to detect and categorize acute peroneal tendon injuries as well as possibly to predict the likelihood and nature of subsequent development of peroneal tenosynovitis.", "PMC3145792": "Caffeine has been cited as a risk factor for osteoporosis in humans. In rats, caffeine increases calcium absorption and excretion and raises parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. This study investigated the effect of chronic caffeine administration on bone histomorphometry and serum markers of bone mineral metabolism. Twenty-seven male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 300 g were divided into three groups: Group A (n = 8) served as controls, Group B (n = 9) received 2.5 mg/100 g caffeine in their drinking water, and Group C (n = 10) received 10 mg/100 g body weight caffeine in their drinking water. Animals were bled serially for the 8 week study period: Ionized calcium was measured from tail vein blood and serum iPTH and osteocalcin (BGP) from orbital sinus blood. All three groups received two doses of tetracycline for bone histomorphometry which was performed on a right tibial section from each animal. Ionized calcium was not different among the three groups at any time point. No alteration in serum iPTH levels was demonstrated except for day 56 when the high-dose group (C) showed a raised level (mean = 59.1, SE = +/- 8.9 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). By week 8 Group C showed a failure to gain weight compared with Group A. Group C mean weight = 384.0 +/- 6.6 g, Group A 427.4 +/- 10.8 g (P less than 0.005).

A general discussion of the techniques in terms of their precision, accuracy, sensitivity and selectivity, with respect to parent drug and metabolites, is used to facilitate a comparison of methods. No one technique can be claimed as the method of choice for these drugs, although gas-liquid chromatography with nitrogen selective detection has some strong claims, viz. generally good sensitivity and reproducibility of assays and ready availability of equipment in most laboratories. The ultimate choice of a method for determining tricyclics will be determined more by the clinical application (routine monitoring versus pharmacokinetics) than by other factors.", "PMC1888821": "Patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency have steatorrhoea as well as vitamin B12 malassimilation. To investigate whether this is caused by the pancreatic insufficiency per se or whether intestinal bacterial overgrowth contributes to the condition, 10 patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea were studied. Intestinal culture was done. Lipid and vitamin B12 assimilation was estimated from faecal spot tests, using 14C-triolein and 58Co-vitamin B12 as tracers and 51CrCl3 as marker. Out of the 10 patients, 9 had either vitamin B12 malassimilation (n = 8), and/or bacterial overgrowth (n = 5). These 9 patients were retested with pancreatic enzyme therapy, with and without addition of the antibiotics metronidazole and cefalexin. The lipid assimilation was significantly increased by enzyme therapy but did not improve further on additional antibiotic treatment.

Seven complete and 15 partial responses were observed in 35 evaluable patients (overall response rate, 62.8%). Both antitumor activity and antitumor spectrum were similar to those for doxorubicin. Since the patients who had had chemotherapy previously, including other kinds of anthracycline, responded rather poorly to THP, cross-resistance between THP and other anthracyclines may be present. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were dose-limiting factors. Nausea and vomiting episodes were mild, and epilation was also minimal. Although the observation period was short and a cumulative dose was not large enough to evaluate cardiotoxicity, there were no abnormal EKG changes or clinical signs of cardiotoxicity in this study. THP is a potent antitumor agent in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.", "PMC3021121": "We determined the nucleotide sequence of a region between the gag and pol genes of a replication-competent proviral clone of a human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) from MT-2 cells. This region overlapping the gag and pol genes contains an open reading frame with a different phase from others. The deduced amino acid sequences show significant homology with the known protease gene of other retroviruses, and harbors highly conserved amino acid sequences that are well conserved in other retroviral protease domains. These results indicate that this open reading frame encodes a HTLV-I protease.", "PMC3102074": "A library of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Drosophila ovarian antigens was established. Each of the MAbs was characterized by its immunohistochemical binding pattern to sections from egg chambers at various stages of oogenesis. Sixteen of the 18 MAbs were found to bind to antigens in mature oocytes. Among the 16 antigens, two were also located in cytoplasm of cell types in the egg chamber other than the oocyte, at all stages of oogenesis. Four made their appearance in nurse cell cytoplasm at mid-vitellogenic stages and shifted to oocyte cytoplasm at a later stage, and ten appeared at the vitellogenic stage and confined their distribution to oocyte cytoplasm. All these antigens were distributed evenly in cytoplasm of mature oocytes. However, some of these antigens were noticed to change their distribution during early embryogenesis as to be localized in a specific region of embryos.", "PMC3667038": "Relationships between respiratory health and environmental conditions (pollen, pollution and meteorology) are investigated in 204 subjects in four symptom groups in four geographical clusters in Tucson. Techniques used are principal components, factor and path analysis. Daily respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flows were recorded during a three-year period. Ambient pollutants, meteorological conditions and pollen types were monitored in or near the clusters. Factor-based scales, which are climate and season specific, are developed for the environmental variables. Three pollutant/meteorological scales represent 'Summer', 'Winter', and 'Humidity'. Four pollen scales represent early and late spring, summer and fall pollen types. Relationships between environmental variables, respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow are analyzed with path diagrams, after accounting for age, sex, smoking habits and stove type. The different effects of the environment on asthmatics, allergics and airways obstructive disease subjects have been demonstrated. Many relationships were found between environmental factors and respiratory responses. The pollutant and meteorological variables are related to respiratory symptoms and peak flow directly as well as through interactions with pollen types. Some of the largest positive coefficients are seen in association with seasonal pollen types, specifically, rhinitis and dyspnoea.", "PMC2839350": "The intranuclear localization of SV40 T-antigen (T-Ag) and the cellular protein p53 was studied in SV40 abortively infected baby mouse kidney cells using two complementary methods of ultrastructural immunocytochemistry in combination with preferential staining of nuclear RNP components and electron microscope autoradiography. Both proteins were revealed in association with peri- and interchromatin RNP fibrils containing the newly synthesized hnRNA. In addition, T-Ag and p53 remained bound, at least in part, to the residual internal nuclear matrix following nuclease and salt extractions of infected cells. The localization of T-Ag was different in SV40 lytically infected monkey kidney cells since, in addition to hnRNP fibrils, the viral protein was also associated with cellular chromatin. However, when lytic infection was performed in conditions of blocked viral DNA replication, T-Ag was no longer associated with the cellular chromatin but remained bound to the hnRNP fibrils. We conclude that the transforming and lytic functions of T-Ag can be distinguished by different subnuclear distributions. The significance of the association of T-Ag and p53 with hnRNP fibrils and the internal nuclear matrix is discussed in relation to the role of these structures in the control of cellular mRNA biogenesis.", "PMC3854285": "The Staphylococcal strains, identified by \"The Simplified Lyogroups System\" were tested for their susceptibility to methicillin and some aminoglycosides. The results, besides showing a higher ratio of susceptibility against aminoglycosides in methicillin-susceptible (MS) strains, show a different trend within each lyogroup. A total of 1616 wild Staphylococcus strains were isolated in microbiological units in Catania, Messina, Rome and Genoa. The results show a high susceptibility to aminoglycosides, both in MS and methicillin-resistant (MR) groups but with different trends among lyogroups.", "PMC3883222": "Histological, histochemical, and histoimmunological studies were conducted on cerebral arteries from three living patients with a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. There seemed to be a correlation between the severity of vasospasm and the magnitude of pathological alterations. Myofibroblasts and Type V collagen within the medial layer were abundant in vessels showing marked constriction, but were less conspicuous in those arteries showing milder involvement. Intracranial arteries from patients who died from noncerebral causes did not demonstrate these changes. Thus, myofibroblasts and Type V collagen may be related to cerebral vasospasm by holding the damaged vessel in a contracted phase for weeks during the healing period.", "PMC3241339": "The effects of a novel piperazine derivative (INO 2628) on sinus node pacemaker activity and atrial contractile force were investigated in isolated, blood-perfused dog atrium. Injections of INO 2628 (0.03-100 mumol) into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium induced a dose-dependent decrease in sinus rate and an increase in contractile force. The positive inotropic effects at more than 10 mumol were accompanied by a transient negative inotropism. Propranolol did not affect the positive inotropic response to INO 2628, but it significantly suppressed positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to norepinephrine. Atropine at a dose which completely blocked negative chronotropic and inotropic responses to carbachol, produced a slight but significant depression of INO 2628-induced negative chronotropic responses; inotropic responses were unaffected. These results suggest that INO 2628 induces noncholinergic negative chronotropic and nonadrenergic positive inotropic responses in isolated dog atria.", "PMC3962079": "A recurrent mammary sarcoma from an 11-year-old, female domestic cat was studied by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The tumor consisted of interlacing bands of spindle cells with elongated blunt-ended nuclei and variable amounts of stroma. Multinucleated tumor giant cells and mitoses were common. Ultrastructurally, tumor cells had abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum with dilated cisternae, a prominent Golgi complex, frequent mitochondria, bundles of intracytoplasmic filaments with focal densities, and discontinuous basal lamina-like material and cell junctions. These findings suggest that myofibroblast-like cells were the predominant type of tumor cell. Failure to demonstrate immunoreactivity for cytokeratins attested to the non-epithelial origin of these neoplastic cells. Uniform immunoreactivity with anti-vimentin antibodies and specific labelling of some tumor cells with antiserum to actin are compatible with an origin of this tumor from modified fibroblasts (i.e., myofibroblast-like cells). Tumors composed largely of myofibroblasts may be unique and warrant separate classification from other types of fibroblastic tumors in animals.", "PMC3990689": "We have used DNA-mediated gene transfer to study homologous recombination in cultured mammalian cells. A family of plasmids with insertion and deletion mutations in the coding region of the herpes simplex type 1 thymidine kinase (tk) gene served as substrates for DNA-mediated gene transfer into mouse Ltk- cells by the calcium phosphate technique. Intermolecular recombination events were scored by the number of colonies in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selective medium. We used supercoiled plasmids containing tk gene fragments to demonstrate that an overlap of 62 base pairs (bp) of homologous DNA was sufficient for intermolecular recombination. Addition of 598 bp of flanking homology separated from the region of recombination by a double-strand gap, deletion, or insertion of heterologous DNA increased the frequency of recombination by 300-, 20-, or 40-fold, respectively. Linearizing one of the mutant plasmids in a pair before cotransfer by cutting in the area of homology flanking a deletion of 104 bp or an insertion of less than 24 bp increased the frequency of recombination relative to that with uncut plasmids. However, cutting an insertion mutant of greater than or equal to 24 bp in the same manner did not increase the frequency. We show how our data are consistent with models that postulate at least two phases in the recombination process: homologous pairing and heteroduplex formation.", "PMC3160408": "Silver foxes selected for domestication behavior were found to have relative hypertrophy of the right heart ventricle, which was 21% as enlarged in males and 18% as enlarged in females as compared with non-domesticated animals. It was established by stereological methods that hypertrophy occurs mainly at the expense of an increase in the absolute and relative content of myofibrils in cardiomyocytes, with the absolute total volume of the mitochondria being equal both in domesticated and non-domesticated animals. It was shown by means of dissociated cell counts that in both animal groups, the absolute number of cardiomyocytes and their nuclei in the right ventricles is approximately similar. It is suggested that there is a relationship between right heart ventricle hypertrophy in domesticated foxes and variation in the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic effects.", "PMC3194193": "There are three principal myosin alkali light chain (MLC) genes expressed in mouse striated muscle. The skeletal muscle gene MLC1F/MLC3F, the ventricular muscle/slow skeletal muscle gene MLC1V(MLC1S), and the atrial muscle/foetal striated muscle gene MLC1A(MLC1emb). MLC1V and MLC1A are expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, and we show here that these genes use a single site of initiation of transcription, and therefore the same proximal promoter region, in both muscle types, and in myogenic cell lines in culture. We have previously shown that for the MLC1F/MLC3F gene, 1200bp of upstream sequence from the MLC1F promoter is sufficient to allow tissue specific and developmentally regulated expression. We have therefore isolated, characterised, and sequenced over 1200bp upstream of each of the three MLC genes in order to look for elements which may be involved in their regulation. Detailed comparison of their promoter sequences, as well as those of the cardiac and skeletal muscle alpha-actin genes, reveals a number of common elements. Among these is an \"MLC-sequence\" (CCTTTTATAG) common to all MLC genes, including those of chick and rat, and a \"cardiac sequence\" common to the mouse MLC1A, MLC1V and alpha-cardiac actin genes expressed in the heart.", "PMC2896104": "In ten young asthmatic subjects, we studied the effect of a single oral dose of 4.4 mg of azelastine hydrochloride on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction during the breathing of cold air.

Placebo had no effect on baseline pulmonary function and postexertional obstruction of the airways, in contrast to azelastine, which exerted a small but significant (p less than 0.05) bronchodilation and a significant attenuation (p less than 0.01) of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as compared to data from before treatment and after placebo.", "PMC3240983": "Bidirectional organelle movements taking place in the cytoplasm of the rhizomes of Caulerpa, a coenocytic marine green alga, have been indicated to be dependent on microtubules (Kuroda, K. & Manabe, E. (1983) Proc. Jpn. Acad. 59B, 131-134; Manabe, E. & Kuroda, K. (1984) Proc. Jpn. Acad. 60B, 118-121). However, when a crude extract of Caulerpa rhizomes was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subjected to immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody, no reacting band could be detected. This apparent absence of tubulin in the extract was found to be a result of the complete degradation of tubulin by potent intrinsic proteolytic activity. All of the commercially available protease inhibitors so far tested (p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, phenyl methylsulfonyl fluoride, 1-chloro-4-phenyl-3-tosylamido-2-butanone, 7-amino-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-2-heptanone, p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester, soybean trypsin inhibitor, antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) failed to inhibit the activity completely. But addition of casein at the concentration of 1% (weight per volume) to the solutions used for preparation was effective in protecting tubulin from proteolytic degradation, thus making it possible to prepare tubulin from the crude extract of Caulerpa. On SDS-PAGE, the Caulerpa alpha-tubulin thus prepared was a little smaller in molecular weight than that of rabbit brain.", "PMC2579254": "Immunohistochemical staining for the A, B and H blood group antigens was studied in 61 normal human ureters using monoclonal antibodies with avidin-biotin complex application. Thirty-seven of these were archival material, and 24 were processed prospectively. In 100 per cent of the prospectively processed ureters, A, B and H antigens were demonstrated corresponding to the blood type of the source. Archival material stained for A, B and H 65 per cent, 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the time, respectively. Serial sampling of prospectively processed ureters showed diminution of staining with prolongation of immersion in formalin. A characteristic staining pattern was found in ureters from patients with type B blood.", "PMC4079662": "We have previously demonstrated that the acute administration of morphine increases the level of endogenous substances, which have antinociceptive activity, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The present study was conducted to determine whether other opioid analgesics exert a similar effect. CSF was withdrawn from the cisterna magna of anesthetized rabbits before and after s.c. injections of meperidine, pentazocine, levorphanol and methadone, and was bioassayed for opioid-like activity in the mouse tail-flick and phenylquinone writhing tests. The opioid-like activity of CSF taken 60 min after meperidine (50 mg/kg) was significantly increased in both bioassays, and the CSF level of meperidine was insufficient to account for this effect. Pentazocine (25-75 mg/kg) also significantly increased opioid-like activity in rabbit CSF, but the effects of methadone (5-10 mg/kg) and levorphanol (20 mg/kg) were less marked. Dextrorphan (20 mg/kg), diazepam (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (20 mg/kg) administration did not significantly increase opioid-like activity in CSF. It is concluded that the antinociceptive action of some opioid analgesics in rabbits may be mediated in part by the release of endogenous antinociceptive substances.", "PMC2219997": "The increased incidence of infections after operations can be connected with changes of the immunocompetent cells. Mononuclear blood-cells were investigated by means of the cell electrophoresis during and after operations under the extracorporeal circulation, because electrophoretically different cells correlate with several immunological phenotypes. A heavy decrease of the electrophoretic quick mobility cell population was found out on the first postoperative day above all. This change allows itself the interpretation by decreasing the T-lymphocytes connected to a relative increase of monocytes, B-cells, and immature T-cells. Besides a lower quotient of the quick and low mobility T-cells refers to a lower immunoregulatory quotient CD4/CD8 after operation. Changes of the cell composition becomes evident also in dependence on the bypass length and the blood supply.", "PMC2954813": "The immunohistochemical distribution of opioid peptides derived from proenkephalin A in the rat pituitary was studied by indirect immunofluorescence; immunoreactive peptides were also characterized by column chromatography followed by specific RIAs. Nerve terminals in the neural lobe were immunoreactive (ir) for Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe (YGGFMRF), Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Gly-Leu (YGGFMRGL), and met-enkephalin [Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met (YGGFM)]. All cells in the intermediate lobe were ir for YGGFMRF, while only occasional cells exhibited YGGFMRGL-like immunoreactivity, and YGGFM-ir cells were not detected in this lobe. In the anterior lobe, some large ovoid cells, identified as gonadotrophs, were immunoreactive for enkephalins. The number of YGGFMRF-ir cells was larger than the number of YGGFMRGL- and YGGFM-ir cells, and these opioid peptides were present in cells that did not contain beta-endorphin immunoreactivity. Twenty times more YGGFMRF than YGGFMRGL-immunoreactivity was present in the anterior lobe, whereas the neurointermediate lobe obtained 4 times more ir YGGFMRF than YGGFMRGL. Pituitary lobe extracts contained substantial amounts of high mol wt forms of ir YGGFMRF and YGGFMRGL, but not of YGGFM or Leu-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu). Low mol wt ir peptides present in both lobes consisted largely of the authentic peptides when analyzed by HPLC; however, an unidentified YGGFMRF-ir peptide was also detected. The results indicate that the proenkephalin A molecule may be processed differentially in the various compartments of the pituitary gland and that opioid peptides derived from this precursor may have functional roles in all three lobes. The relatively large amount of YGGFMRF immunoreactivity, which was detected both biochemically and immunohistochemically, indicates that YGGFMRF-ir peptides may be important proenkephalin A-derived products in the pituitary gland.", "PMC2174363": "In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, addition of glucose to cells grown under glucose-derepressed conditions induces a transient rise in the intracellular level of cAMP. This modulation requires functional elements of the cAMP-producing pathway, adenylate cyclase, ras proteins and the product of CDC25 gene. To determine whether or not the CDC25 gene product is a transducing element in the signal-transmission pathway leading from glucose to ras adenylate cyclase we have made use of the mutated allele RAS2Ile152 whose gene product uncouples the product of CDC25 from adenylate cyclase, but does not promotes other secondary phenotypes. The transient increase in cAMP is lost in cells lacking a functional CDC25 gene product, although they produce a normal amount of cAMP with the RAS2Ile152 gene. This result demonstrates the requirement of CDC25 for mediation of glucose signal transmission. The fact that cells grow normally on glucose in the absence of glucose-induced cAMP signaling confirms that this signaling pathway is not essential for growth on glucose. To further analyze the role of the CDC25 gene product we have made use of truncated versions of the gene. The results show that the C-terminal part of the gene alone is able to mediate glucose-induced activation of the RAS adenylate cyclase pathway.", "PMC3797983": "Seven subjects were tested, each on eight separate sessions, for brainstem auditory evoked responses to monaural right, monaural left, and binaural stimulus presentations. Comparisons of between-subject vs. within-subject variability of the absolute latencies of vertex-positive peaks expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation indicate that: within-subject stability is greater than between-subject stability for the five brainstem peaks; between-subject variability shows significant differences due to peak but not to ear of presentation; within-subject variability shows significant differences due to both peak and ear; comparisons of within-subject variability over time show significant differences due to peak but not to time; patterns of individual variation within the brainstem series are characterized by increases in stability of peak latencies over time, and by replicability of stability profiles over time. Other measures of latency and amplitude based on this series of responses are planned for a subsequent report.", "PMC3656102": "The determination of picomolar levels of histamine and its major metabolite, N tau-methylhistamine, in biological fluids was achieved using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection.

Our experience with two patients, one with chronic vaginal discharge and the other with acute overwhelming sepsis, emphasizes the wide spectrum of clinical presentations that may accompany this entity. In patients with chronic symptoms, surgery is indicated to forestall further local infectious complications, and a single-stage sigmoid resection without hysterectomy may be adequate. If malignancy cannot be excluded, a single-stage en bloc resection of the uterus and colon is the procedure of choice. Hysterectomy may also be mandatory to extirpate a nidus of acute infection. When severe local inflammation or obstruction mandate urgent operation, a two-stage procedure involving resection and end colostomy, followed by reanastomosis at a later time, is safest and most effective.", "PMC3339871": "This report provides quasi-longitudinal independent analysis data on two groups of 10 children at 2:0 (years:months), 2:5, 2:9, and 3:3.

Minoxidil caused increases in mean right atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance were reduced; cardiac output was increased. Left ventricular stroke work and the systolic pressure time index were unchanged by monoxidil administration. The diastolic pressure time index and ratio of diastolic/systolic pressure time index were decreased by minoxidil. Regional myocardial blood flow, measured with radioactive microspheres, increased in all regions of the heart except to the left ventricular papillary muscles. Minoxidil increased blood flow to left ventricular subendocardial tissue; however, this increase was significantly less than that observed in corresponding areas of subepicardial tissue, thus reducing the subendocardial/subepicardial tissue blood flow ratio. These results suggest that minoxidil is an effective peripheral vasodilator but may result in inadequate subendocardial perfusion. Morphologic studies disclosed two types of minoxidil-induced cardiac lesions: left ventricular papillary muscle necroses, and hemorrhagic lesions which were most prominent in right atrium and were associated with inflammation, intramural hemorrhage, and fibrinoid necrosis of small arteries. The papillary muscle necrosis were attributed to hypoxia. The atrial lesions were not of ischemic or hypoxic origin, because minoxidil did not decrease blood flow to atrial tissue. It is suggested that the atrial lesions are related to excessive vasodilation.", "PMC2924402": "Levels of urinary mutagens, thioethers, N-nitrosamino acids, nitrate, nicotine, cotinine and creatinine were measured in 21 non-smokers, 26 smokers of blond tobacco, 9 smokers of black tobacco and 5 smokers of both types of tobacco, all eating a similar diet. Results were expressed either per 24 h urine or per mmol creatinine. The sum of urinary nicotine and cotinine levels (N + C) was used as a measure of exposure to the number of cigarettes smoked. Statistically significant positive dose-effect relationships were obtained between the urinary N + C levels and (i) the number of revertants (Salmonella typhimurium TA98, with a metabolic activation system); (ii) the concentration of thioethers; (iii) the levels of N-nitrosoproline or the sum of all nitrosamino acids excreted and (iv) the amount of urinary nitrate. No such correlation was found between N + C levels and induction potency in the SOS chromotest. A linear dose-effect relationship between urinary mutagenicity (i.e. log revertants of S. typhimurium TA98) and N + C levels or number of cigarettes per day was established for smokers of blond tobacco. After adjustment for N + C levels, the urine of smokers of black tobacco contained twice as much mutagenic material as did the urine of blond tobacco smokers (P = 0.02). For other exposure markers, no statistically significant difference was found between the two types of smokers. Epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of urinary bladder cancer is 2.5 times higher in smokers of black tobacco than in blond tobacco. Therefore, our findings on urinary mutagenicity provide experimental evidence that the type of tobacco is the factor responsible for the observed difference in risk and that smoking of black as compared to blond tobacco results in a higher exposure of the urinary bladder to genotoxic hence potentially carcinogenic substances.", "PMC2367626": "For medical imaging in the pelvic region in female infertility/sterility several methods of investigation are available.

In an attempt better to define the prevalence of IgE antibodies in workers exposed to grain dusts, we performed the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) on worker sera using both commercial allergens prepared from grain and worksite allergens prepared from grain dust samples collected at the worksite. We found that the two types of reagents identified different populations with respect to the specificity of IgE antibodies present. The RAST assay performed using worksite allergens correlated well with skin test procedures. These results may allow us to gain better understanding of allergy associated with grain dust exposure, and document the utility of the RAST assay in assessment of occupational allergies.", "PMC1626159": "Recently published results of large randomized trials have changed the recommendations for adjuvant treatment in patients with colorectal cancer.

The published results of these operations as regards relief of ventricular tachycardia and survival are highly variable. The data presented here are largely based on a multi-institutional registry series (n = 665) and the combined Dusseldorf-Birmingham/Alabama (DUS-UAB) ventricular tachycardia surgery experience (n = 216). DATA: Survival (hospital deaths included) was 75% one year after operation and 45% at 5 years (DUS-UAB). The respective data of the registry series were 78% and 55%. The most prevalent mode of death in both analyses was acute/subacute/chronic heart failure. More extensive encircling procedures (incisional/cryo) for ventricular tachycardia ablation and the combination of encircling cryoablation and endocardial resection increased the risk of progressive left ventricular dysfunction and death; however, by multivariate analysis the severity of the underlying ischemic heart disease (indicated by NYHA functional class, LVEDP, No. of previous infarcts, and extensiveness of coronary disease) and the absence of a discrete left ventricular aneurysm were more powerful predictors for early and late postoperative mortality than the use of alternative surgical techniques for ventricular tachycardia ablation. Survival was particularly poor after the return of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3203118": "Fourteen term newborns and infants with congenital hypothyroidism were studied before (T0) and after (T1) 1 month of replacement therapy. From T0 to T1 serum total cholesterol and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol remained constant and at normal levels whereas low-density-lipoprotein apolipoprotein B and triacyglycerol concentrations increased slightly. The proportion of large-size high-density-lipoprotein subfraction was high at T0 and decreased very significantly at T1. Conversely, postheparin serum hepatic lipase activity was low before treatment and increased after thyroxine therapy. Lipoprotein lipase activity remained low throughout the study. These results suggest that, in contrast to adult hypothyroidism, low-density-lipoprotein catabolism is not altered in congenital hypothyroidism. However, as in adults, a defect of lipolytic enzyme activities is present and can induce an impairment of the elimination of cholesterol via the high-density-lipoprotein route and, potentially, of the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Beyond the scope of congenital hypothyroidism, one should keep in mind these results when attending infants with transient low thyroid hormone levels and lipid intolerance.", "PMC3879071": "Sonic stimulation at a frequency of 1200 Hz increases nuclear volume in the upper part of the maculae by 30-45%, whereas after stimulation at a frequency of 250 Hz nuclear changes (30-38%) were noted mainly in the caudal parts.

The recipients of bone graft were divided into two groups--one receiving autogenous cancellous bone, the other receiving nonviable autogenous autoclaved cortical bone. Quantitative bacterial cultures were collected both at the time of wound closure and 2 weeks after closure. A significantly increased level of soft-tissue contamination was associated with wound closure in the presence of either type of bone graft, indicating an overall adverse effect on soft tissues. A critical level existed such that at initial bacterial contamination levels greater than 10(4) organisms/g tissue, final contamination levels were significantly elevated. With initial contamination levels less than 10(4) organisms/g tissue, however, final bacterial contamination levels were not significantly different. These results may help explain the different rates of infection that have been reported when delayed primary closure of open fractures is done in conjunction with autogenous bone graft.", "PMC2224052": "The conformation of the acyclic biscystine peptide S,S'-bis(Boc-Cys-Ala-OMe) has been studied in the solid state by x-ray diffraction, and in solution by 1H- and 13C-nmr, ir, and CD methods. The peptide molecule has a twofold rotation symmetry and adopts an intramolecular antiparallel beta-sheet structure in the solid state. The two antiparallel extended strands are stabilized by two hydrogen bonds between the Boc CO and Ala NH groups [N...O 2.964 (3) A, O...HN 2.11 (3) A, and NH...O angle 162 (3) degrees]. The disulfide bridge has a right-handed conformation with the torsion angle C beta SSC beta = 95.8 (2) degrees. In solution the presence of a twofold rotation symmetry in the molecule is evident from the 1H- and 13C-nmr spectra. 1H-nmr studies, using solvent and temperature dependencies of NH chemical shifts, paramagnetic radical induced line broadening, and rate of deuterium-hydrogen exchange effects on NH resonances, suggest that Ala NH is solvent shielded and intramolecularly hydrogen bonded in CDCl3 and in (CD3)2SO. Nuclear Overhauser effects observed between Cys C alpha H and Ala NH protons and ir studies provide evidence of the occurrence of antiparallel beta-sheet structure in these solvents. The CD spectra of the peptide in organic solvents are characteristic of those observed for cystine peptides that have been shown to adopt antiparallel beta-sheet structures.", "PMC3359765": "A general multi-tasking control system has been developed for real-time signal processing.
