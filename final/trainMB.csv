"Positive donors were not only resistant to lysis by the HLA-A11-restricted CTL generated by stimulation with the autologous LCL, but also to HLA-A11-specific CTL derived from lymphocytes of an EBV-seronegative donor stimulated with an allogeneic LCL",Findings
" Using the same and additional cell lines, we now show that the CTL resistance of the BL lines is probably due to a selective down-regulation of HLA-A11",Findings
 We also show that the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein is expressed at a lower level in the EBV-carrying BL lines than in EBV-transformed LCLs,None
 Only one of eight in vitro EBV-converted BL lines that shifted to a more LCL-like growth pattern expressed LMP at a high level,Findings
 This line also reexpressed the HLA-A11 antigen that was undetectable in its EBV-negative progenitor,None
 Our findings suggest that the typical BL cell phenotype is associated with low expression of both proteins,Findings
"Although viral illnesses are predisposing causes for pulmonary bacterial infections, the interrelationships of viral virulence and host immunity to alterations in susceptibility to bacterial infection are incompletely understood",None
 We used two mutant strains of encephalomyocarditis virus (minimally virulent Mengo-37A and a highly virulent Columbia SK [Col-SK]) to investigate these interrelationships,Method
" Mice that had been immunized to Mengo-37A, and nonimmunized controls, were challenged with aerosols containing 10(4) plaque-forming units of Mengo-37A or Col-SK per liter",Method
 The effect of each viral infection on pulmonary antibacterial activity was assessed 3 days later by measuring the capacity of the lungs to kill inhaled radiophosphorus ((32)P)-labeled Staphylococcus aureus,Method
 The degree of antibacterial dysfunction found was proportional to the virulence of the infecting virus,Findings
" If the host was immune to the infecting virus, bactericidal function was not impaired by viral challenge",Method
" Neither mutant caused significant pulmonary damage; therefore: (i) viral-induced impairment in bactericidal activity reflects, quantitatively, the virulence of the virus and (ii) viral immunity protects pulmonary bacterial defenses by preventing damage to the phagocyte from the virus or its attendant metabolic abnormalities",Findings
Two cases are presented in which transverse esophageal folds were observed in children following ingestion of corrosive material,None
" These findings lend additional credence to the concept that transverse folds, reflecting contractions of the muscularis mucosae, represent a pattern of pathologic motility rather than merely a variant of normal mucosal anatomy",None
"One hundred twenty-two preterm infants were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PVH-IVH)",Method
" Before random assignment, data on the infants were stratified according to low-weight (500 to 999 g) or high-weight (1000 to 1500 g) subgroups",Method
 Cranial sonography was used to document the absence of PVH-IVH before enrollment and the occurrence of PVH-IVH during the 7-day protocol,Method
"1 mg/kg, or placebo was administered before 12 hours of age and at 24, 48, and 72 hours of age",Method
 Five patients receiving indomethacin and six receiving placebo were withdrawn before completion of the study,Method
" In the remaining 111 patients, the indomethacin and placebo groups were comparable with respect to gestational ages, maternal complications, Apgar scores, ventilatory requirements, complications of prematurity, and mortality rate",Findings
 PVH-IVH developed in six of 56 infants who received indomethacin and 11 of 55 infants who received placebo (P = 0,Data
 Analysis of the individual strata showed that the indomethacin-treated infants in the low-weight subgroup sustained a higher mortality rate (11/17 vs 3/16,Data
" Infants in the indomethacin-treated high-weight subgroup demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of PVH-IVH (2/39 vs 8/39; P = 0.04), but the frequency of high-grade hemorrhages was comparable for both indomethacin- and placebo-treated groups",Data
"04), but the frequency of high-grade hemorrhages was comparable for both indomethacin- and placebo-treated groups",None
" In summary, the prophylactic administration of intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of PVH-IVH cannot be recommended for infants less than 1000 g",Findings
" In preterm infants between 1000 and 1500 g birth weight, indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of PVH-IVH",Findings
"The use of smooth and threaded pins for internal fixation is often complicated by component migration, especially when employed about the acromioclavicular joint",None

"Detection of cytokine-producing cells can be accomplished by reverse modifications of the ELISPOT assay using cytokine-specific unconjugated and enzyme-labelled antibodies as solid phase capture system and detecting reagents, respectively",Method
" However, in certain situations where the secreted cytokine is produced in minute amounts such as in the case of interleukin-1 (IL-1), the sensitivity of the indicator immunoenzyme system employed may be insufficient to permit detection of the corresponding secreting cells",Method
 We have developed a novel immunoenzyme amplification procedure that involves the use of a biotinylated secondary anti-enzyme antibody reagent to enhance the signal provided by the primary enzyme-labelled antibody conjugate,Method
" Following addition of enzyme-conjugated avidin, ELISPOT assay wells are developed with a suitable chromogen substrate yielding spots located at the former position of cells secreting the analyte under study",None

All-trans retinoic acid induces leukemic cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) to differentiate in vitro to mature granulocytes which express the CD15 antigen and are capable of respiratory burst function,None
" In eight cases, we compared the efficacy of two naturally occurring isomers of retinoic acid, all-trans RA and 13-cis RA",Method
 The maximal response was maintained at 10(-7) mol/L for the all-trans but not for the 13-cis RA,Data
 We also observed that the metabolites 4-oxo-all-trans and 4-oxo-13-cis were effective at 10(-6) mol/L,Data
 This 1 order of magnitude difference in the in vitro differentiating potencies of all-trans RA and 13-cis RA in the blasts of promyelocytic leukemias predicts a difference in the clinical efficacy of the two drugs,Findings

Transfusions of highly purified LEW erythrocytes (E) administered to BN recipients prior to insertion of LEW kidneys markedly prolonged the survival of these allografts (greater than 35 days),Data
"1L E were shown to carry at least the same quantity of LEW MHC antigens on their surface as LEW E, thus the failure to prolong LEW kidney graft survival is due to the absence of LEW non-MHC antigens from BN",Findings
"1L E prior to transfusion failed to restore the beneficial effect, demonstrating that donor E-mediated prolonged renal allograft survival requires the presence of both MHC and non-MHC alloantigens on the same E",None
A double blind trial of bromocriptine in the treatment of 14 patients with the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy is reported,Method
 5 patients did not complete the trial mainly because of side-effects due to an overdosage of bromocriptine,Data

 Diabetic control was determined by measuring glycosylated hemoglobin,None
" Subjects were asked to identify how they perceived family cohesion, family dysfunction, relationship distance, and social support",Method
" Initial analysis, utilizing bivariate correlations because of the small sample size, revealed statistically significant correlations between the adolescent's perception of family cohesion and diabetes control",Findings
" Moreover, the more dysfunctional the parents perceived the family system, the worse the diabetic control of the adolescent",Findings
 Adolescents with better diabetic control had fathers who perceived a greater distance between the mother-father relationship as well as a greater distance between the ideal father-patient relationship,Findings
 Patients who perceived their mothers as nonsupportive experienced worse diabetic control,Findings
 Yet patients who perceived they had more social support experienced better control of their diabetes,None

Detection probabilities for wavelength changes were measured as functions of stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) with the chromatic double-pulse method,Method
 Two test stimuli of a wavelength lambda t were successively exchanged with a reference stimulus of a wavelength lambda r in equal luminance for a short duration with a SOA,Method
" Durations were 5 and 50 msec, and the SOA varied between 5 or 50 and 2000 msec",Data
" Lambda r's were 571 and 518 nm, chosen from wavelengths near unique yellow and unique green so that wavelength difference delta lambda = lambda t - lambda r was perceived mainly as redness and greeness for lambda r = 571 nm and yellowness and blueness for lambda r = 518 nm",Data
" The results showed that temporal integration characteristics for these equal-luminance wavelength changes were quite consistent: complete integration with SOA up to 20 msec, partial integration with SOA between 20 and 200 msec, and probability integration with SOA greater than 200 msec",Findings
 They did not show any inhibitory integration that was found for luminance changes,Findings
"The vagus nerve, as a result of its protracted course from the brain stem to the abdomen, can present a difficult imaging problem when it is compromised by a clinically occult lesion",Findings
 The clinical and radiologic records of 48 patients with suspected vagus nerve dysfunction were reviewed to derive an efficient and effective approach to imaging this patient population,Data
 An imaging algorithm is proposed in which vagal neuropathies are divided both clinically and radiologically into proximal and distal categories,Software
 Proximal vagal lesions are part of a cranial neuropathy complex and have associated oropharyngeal signs and symptoms (e,None
 Distal vagal lesions occur as an isolated paralysis of the vagus nerve with no symptoms or signs referable to the oropharynx,Data

" The instrument evaluates dependency in relation to bathing/hygiene, activity, technical procedures, and monitoring signs and symptoms",Method
 The sample used in this study consisted of 150 subjects admitted to one of three types of home health care agencies,Data
 Interrater reliability and internal consistency of the instrument were high,Data
 Factor analysis produced results similar to those of the developers for three of the four scale items,Data

"To evaluate the single ECG lead with the maximal ST-segment elevation on admission as a modality suitable for monitoring ischemic injury and necrosis, the author correlated the single lead from 49-lead precordial maps and that from the corresponding standard ECGs with the ECG systems from which they derived",Method
 A total of 265 pairs of studies (14 per patient) from 20 patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction were used,Data
" Serial recordings were done on admission, at 12 predetermined time intervals during hospitalization, and at discharge",Method
" The amplitudes of ST-segment elevation, R waves, and Q waves of the single lead and all of the complexes of the corresponding precordial maps or standard ECGs were measured, using the same methodology",Method
 The single ECG lead correlated well with the precordial maps and the standard ECG,Findings
" Although in serial studies the originally selected single lead was not the one displaying the maximal ST-segment elevation in 29% of the studies, it was always located on a locus immediately adjacent to the new lead in the grid recording the maximal ST",Data
 Changes in the precordial map or standard ECG were always detected by the corresponding single lead,Findings
" The single lead from the standard ECG reflected changes in the precordial map, indicating that a precordial map is not necessary on admission for identification of the single lead",Findings
" Correlations of R waves and Q waves from the single lead and the precordial map or the single lead and the standard ECG were not as good as the ones found for ST-segment elevation, although they provided monitoring of directional changes of the QRS complexes during hospitalization",Findings
" Thus, a single lead from a precordial map or standard ECG is adequate for monitoring of the magnitude of ischemic injury in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction",Findings
 The single lead also provides some information as to the evolution of changes in the precordial QRS complexes associated with infarction and maintains its traditional role of providing surveillance for arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities,Findings
Previous observations have indicated that Drosophila DNA contains a component that evolves so rapidly that it fails to hybridize between the DNAs of sibling species,Data
