{"PMC3030942": "Facilitation of yolk-sac carcinoma (YSCa) development in fetectomized rats by the Moloney murine sarcoma virus/murine leukemia virus (Mo-MSV/MLV) complex was found to be closely associated with the presence of Mo-MSV sequences in the genomes of the YSCa cells. The virus-induced YSCas consisted of cells of mono- or oligoclonal origin which always contained in their genomes at least I randomly integrated Mo-MSV provirus. In YSCas which developed in the absence of virus, no rearrangement or amplification of c-mos could be detected. In addition, blot hybridization analysis of cellular RNA failed to detect mos-related RNA in cell lines derived from Mo-MSV-induced as well as from non-virally induced YSCas. The methylation level of c-mos DNA was low in all YSCa cell lines. In contrast, v-mos DNA in cell lines derived from Mo-MSV-induced YSCas was heavily methylated.", "PMC2654084": "This article investigates whether an empirical basis exists for the hypothesis that nursing homes exploit the irrationality of some nursing home patients by providing inadequate quality care. Evidence from Wisconsin in 1983 shows that violations of the Medicaid certification code in nursing homes are not statistically related to two measures of consumer rationality. Violations are, however, related to a measure of the need to compete for patients, despite the presence of an effective program to enforce these certification standards through fines. Specifically, it is found that, where the bed supply is tight, an additional empty bed in every nursing home in a county is associated with between five and six fewer class C violations (or their equivalent) in every home. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the quality problems that nursing homes have traditionally exhibited are linked to the absence of a need to complete for patients, created by the bed shortage conditions that continue to characterize a large portion of nursing home care markets in the United States. The implications for public policy are discussed.", "PMC3447885": "Alveolar macrophages (AM) have been extensively studied, but whether these lavageable cells are representative of the lung's interstitial macrophage population is unknown. Previous investigators have compared AM with macrophages obtained from mechanically disrupted whole lung tissue and have found both populations to be morphologically and functionally similar. In such studies, neither the anatomical origin of the macrophages harvested from lung tissue postlavage nor the quantitative removal of AM by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was demonstrated. Accordingly, the extent to which unlavaged AM contributed to the macrophage population obtained from mechanically disrupted lung tissue remains obscure. The present study was undertaken to determine whether macrophages harvested by mechanical disruption of lung tissue following exhaustive BAL are in fact primarily of interstitial origin. We addressed this problem by labeling rat AM with opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC-IgG) in situ, exhaustively lavaging the lungs to remove AM, and then mincing the residual lung tissue to liberate unlavaged macrophages for subsequent in vitro analyses. We recovered 24.5 +/- 1.3 X 10(6) AM with 18 lavages, 79.5 +/- 2.5% of which had phagocytized SRBC-IgG. Mincing the lavaged tissue resulted in the further release of 2.7 +/- 0.4 X 10(6) viable cells, approximately 85% of which morphologically appeared to be macrophages. The percentage of these cells that were prelabeled with SRBC-IgG and the numerical distribution of the SRBC-IgG among them were virtually identical to those among AM. The percentage of SRBC-IgG-containing macrophages was increased only slightly (11.4 +/- 1.9%) by further incubating macrophages harvested from minced lung with the SRBC-IgG in vitro, and most of this increase could be accounted for by unlavaged AM that did not phagocytize the test particles in situ. Moreover, multiparameter flow cytometric analyses of macrophages obtained by BAL and from minced lung tissue demonstrated that these populations were identical in terms of size, light scatter properties, and laser-excited blue and green-yellow autofluorescence characteristics. We conclude that (1) exhaustive lavage fails to retrieve a significant number of AM, and (2) macrophages obtained by mechanically disrupting lung tissue are derived primarily from the alveolar space compartment and not the interstitial compartment, as some investigators contend.", "PMC3045327": "The 19,000 Mr C-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli ada gene product that contains O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase DNA repair activity has been crystallized in a low-salt environment.

Growth delay determination suggested that clonogenic cell kill was less than was obtained by direct assay of cell survival. Recovery from potentially lethal damage was assayed in one line (HC12) but was not demonstrable, and clonogenic cell survival decreased with time in treated spheroids with diameters greater than 300 microns which contained a hypoxic cell population. Microscopic examination of the treated spheroids showed the emergence of an abnormal giant-cell population, and the progressive clonogenic cell loss that occurred after treatment was thought to be due to oxygen and nutrient deprivation of the remaining viable cells by this doomed cell population. Correction of the growth delay measurements for changes in cell size and clonogenic cell population allowed correlation of the growth delay and cell survival data.", "PMC2229395": "We compared an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated oligonucleotide DNA probe with the Sereny test to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the probe in detecting virulent Shigella strains.

The probe did not hybridize with any of the Sereny-test-negative S. dysenteriae type 1 strains. This nonradioactive, synthetic probe provides a simple, rapid way to test a large number of strains simultaneously in a field setting, which will contribute to an improved understanding of the epidemiologic patterns of shigellosis in developing countries.", "PMC3575807": "The aim of this work has been the study of the mechanism of lymph formation and drainage in the upper limb in patients with monolateral lymphoedema (15 limbs, L) in comparison with the apparently healthy limb (S) as well as with a control group (8 limbs, C).

Results were expressed as percentage of the id removed from the injection site 1 and 6 hr pi, mean T6%/h it is (T6-T1)/5 and percentage lymph nodes uptake at the same times. Mean T6%/h is significantly different between C and L, but not between L and S, while lymph node uptake at 6 hr shows a significant difference even between C and S.

He was admitted to hospital, with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and pulmonary edema. There was no previous syncope or thromboembolism episodes. Apparently the anticoagulant therapy wasn't interrupted. The diagnosis of the free floating left atrial thrombus was made by two-dimensional echocardiography. Predisposing factors, clinical course and echocardiographic diagnosis are discussed. The risk of prolonged engagement of the thrombus in the mitral orifice, causing syncope or sudden death, justifies urgent surgery associating thrombectomy and treatment of mitral stenosis.", "PMC2224620": "The axial images of 58 lumbar disks having degenerative disorders imaged by gradient refocused echo (GRE) and spin echo (SE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pulse sequences at high field strength were compared for diagnostic quality.

Axial GRE images are therefore useful adjuncts to SE images for effective MRI of degenerative lumbar spine disorders at high field strength.", "PMC4332246": "HeLa S3 cells, a clonal strain adapted for growth in suspension culture, contain adenylate cyclase activity that is stimulated by glucagon, prostaglandin E(1), and epinephrine. Total enzymatic activity and response to hormones is increased as a result of these cells being in stationary culture for several days. The parental strain of HeLa cells normally grown in stationary culture shows even greater adenylate cyclase activity. Hepatoma (HTC) cells grown in suspension culture have no detectable adenylate cyclase activity, but when grown in stationary culture they contain low, but detectable, amounts of adenylate cyclase, which is stimulated by glucagon, epinephrine, or prostaglandins. Chang's liver cells, both suspension and stationary culture, contain relatively high levels of adenylate cyclase that is stimulated by epinephrine or prostaglandin E(1), with differences in activity depending upon culture conditions. Adenylate cyclase of 3T3 and L929 mouse fibroblasts respond to catecholamines, as well as to prostaglandin E(1), but not to glucagon. Characteristic increases in basal activity of adenylate cyclase and in activity in the presence of hormone occurred as cell density increased during stationary culture of certain cell lines, but do not occur with fluoride ion present. In addition to the influence of growth conditions and rate or phase of cell growth on cyclase activity and hormonal response, the cultured cell lines frequently showed marked differences in activity from one another; malignant cells generally exhibited less activity. It is postulated that adenylate cyclase activity may be enhanced by cell to surface contact or cell to cell interaction and that this phenomenon may represent a form of self regulation or modulation of hormonal response by a tissue.", "PMC2478546": "Met-tRNAfMet from Escherichia coli is utilized efficiently as an elongator tRNA during protein synthesis in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate since it rapidly incorporates its methionyl residue into the same tryptic peptides of rabbit globin as the endogenous Met-tRNAmMet. Therefore, it must lack the structural characteristics that prevent the eukaryotic initiator tRNA from entering elongation. In contrast, E. coli Met-tRNAfMet appears to initiate very poorly since, unlike reticulocyte Met-tRNAiMet, it forms no detectable 43 S preinitiation complexes, and only a very small fraction of the methionine it contributes to polyribosomal peptidyl-tRNA is found at the N terminus. The bacterial fMet-tRNAfMet, which cannot elongate, is utilized for polypeptide chain initiation at a much lower level than the formylated Met-tRNAiMet from eukaryotes. The ability of E. coli Met-tRNAfMet to be used as an elongator and fMet-tRNAfMet as an initiator in the reticulocyte lysate may be considerably underestimated because of the rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of these initiator tRNAs in the lysate. The enzyme hydrolyzes fMet-tRNAfMet and Met-tRNAfMet from E. coli in a strictly Mg2+-dependent manner but not the corresponding species from yeast or rabbit reticulocytes. It also hydrolyzes yeast N-acetyl-Phe-tRNAPhe and reticulocyte peptidyl-tRNA, showing that this enzyme--like the eukaryotic protein synthetic machinery--does not readily distinguish the bacterial tRNAfMet from eukaryotic elongator tRNA.", "PMC3405660": "Previous studies of childhood chest pain have been retrospective or considered only limited age groups or referred patients. In this study, all children who were admitted to the emergency department with chest pain were evaluated prospectively. Patients with ill-defined chest pain had ECGs and echocardiograms performed. A total of 407 children were evaluated. The most common causes of the pain were idiopathic (21%) and musculoskeletal (15%). Cardiac problems were found in 4%. Chest pain was acute (of less than 48 hours' duration) in 43% and chronic (of greater than 6 months' duration) in 7%. Pain caused 30% of children to stay out of school and 31% to awaken from sleep. Chest wall tenderness was the most common abnormality. ECGs were obtained in 47%; results of 31/191 were abnormal but only 4/191 ECG abnormalities were related to the diagnosis. Echocardiograms were obtained in 34%; results of 17/139 were abnormal (12/139 showed mitral valve prolapse). Young children are more likely to have cardiorespiratory problems; children older than 12 years of age are more likely to have psychogenic pain. The description and location of the pain and the patient's sex are not related to the diagnosis. Nonorganic disease is related to a family history of heart disease or chest pain or having chronic pain. Organic disease is related to pain of acute onset, abnormal physical examination results, pain that awakens the child from sleep, and the presence of fever. Laboratory tests are rarely helpful in evaluating children with chest pain. Chest pain in children is usually benign.

The factor responsible is nondialyzable and trypsin sensitive. The stimulation is proportional to the concentration of lipoprotein deficient serum in the media and is present at all oleate concentrations and incubation times assayed. The protein has been partially purified by column chromatography to yield a Peak II fraction which stimulates triglyceride synthesis in both fibroblasts and isolated human adipocytes. The stimulation is dependent on the concentration of protein fraction and increases to an apparent saturation level of 200% in fibroblasts. Triglyceride synthesis, however, increases to a much greater extent in adipocytes and did not demonstrate saturation at the maximum Peak II protein concentration assayed.

The influence of PEEP during controlled mechanical ventilation on the circulating concentrations of the N-terminus and C-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) prohormone which both contain natriuretic and diuretic peptides was investigated in 7 patients with acute respiratory failure. The 98 amino acid (aa) N-terminus, the midportion of the N-terminus consisting of aa 31-67 of the 126 aa ANF prohormone (i.e., pro ANF 31-67) and the C-terminus (aa 99-126; ANF) were found to be significantly (p less than 0.05; ANOVA) elevated compared to 54 healthy volunteers during acute respiratory failure prior to institution of PEEP. With institution of 10 cm of H2O of PEEP all 7 patients had a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in the circulating concentrations of pro ANFs 1-98, 31-67 and ANF. These findings suggest that the increased thoracic pressure secondary to PEEP which reduces venous return and lowers atrial filling pressure results in a decreased release of the N-terminus and C-terminus of the ANF prohormone. This decrease in the N-terminus and C-terminus of the ANF prohormone appears to represent a physiologic mechanism for restoration of intravascular volume, secondary to decreased sodium excretion.", "PMC3629649": "Of 1,643 cranial computed tomography (CT) scans done in a primary-tertiary care private hospital over a 1-year period, 11 (0.67%) showed diffuse confluent white matter lucencies of less than 30 Hounsfield units. By retrospective analysis, at least 4 of the 11 were demented. Of these, 3 had clinical evidence of Binswanger's disease--characterized by progressive dementia, incontinence, variable pseudobulbar signs, and acute and subacute motor deficits. Two additional patients suffered only transient ischemic attacks or lacunar strokes; 2 had syncope; 1 had multiple sclerosis. The remaining patients were neurologically asymptomatic. In this small retrospective series, the severity of CT changes did not distinguish the patients with clinical Binswanger's syndrome from neurologically less symptomatic patients. Ten of the eleven patients had disordered blood pressure regulation--hypertension, labile systolic pressure, orthostatic hypotension, or a combination of these factors. The severity of CT changes correlated more clearly with blood pressure instability than with clinical encephalopathy.

Portal venous flow measured by the pulsed Doppler flowmeter in 14 patients with cirrhosis and nine patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, who underwent operation 2-5 yr earlier, was significantly reduced compared with that in unoperated 49 patients with cirrhosis and 17 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension who had esophageal varices (410 +/- 158 versus 660 +/- 263 ml/min in cirrhosis; 443 +/- 185 versus 912 +/- 189 ml/min in idiopathic portal hypertension). In nine patients (six cirrhosis, three idiopathic portal hypertension), portal venous flow and portal vein pressure were measured before and after operation. In patients with cirrhosis, portal vein pressure did not change significantly postoperatively even though portal venous flow was reduced. In contrast, portal vein pressure decreased in two patients with idiopathic portal hypertension in whom portal venous flow was reduced. Portal vein pressure was elevated in one patient with idiopathic portal hypertension in whom portal venous flow was increased postoperatively as a result of resection of a large gastro- and splenorenal shunt conducted additionally.", "PMC2108789": "Timed morulae of different stages of development were exposed to cytochalasin B causing depolymerisation of microfilaments and to ECCD-1 antibodies interacting with Ca2(+)-dependent adhesion molecules or cultured in the absence of calcium. All three treatments decompacted mid-morula-stage embryos within one hour. Late morulae were resistant to ECCD-1 antibody treatment and relatively resistant to calcium-free cultivation, but not to cytochalasin B treatment. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the decompacting treatments not only loosened the interblastomere contacts but also resulted in rearrangement of the cell surface microvilli. Transmission electron microscopy showed that normal, untreated embryos had specialized membrane junctions in the most apical regions of the interblastomere contacts. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that these apical junction areas contained vinculin, a protein typical of adherent junctions. Upon decompaction the apical junctions disappeared completely. When transferred back to the normal medium, the embryos rapidly started to recompact. Simultaneously the apical junctions and cell surface microvilli reassumed the organization characteristic of the morula stage. Late morulae that were resistant to treatment had normal apical junctional areas. During subcultivation in the normal medium, the treated morulae developed into morphologically normal blastocysts. These data indicate that adherent-type junctions and cell surface microvilli participate in the initiation and maintenance of compaction of morula-stage embryos.", "PMC2923228": "A comparative study of the adrenergic control of two sequential rabbit intrarenal arteries of differing diameter [intrarenal branch artery (IRBA)-unstretched lumen diameter (ULD) approximately 300 microns and interlobar artery (ILA)-ULD approximately 250 microns] has been conducted. The neurogenic contractile response of isolated segments in relation to the maximum response to l-norepinephrine (NE) was minimal (8 Hz response approximately 30% of maximum contraction) and similar in both types of arteries. Phentolamine (PTA) (10(-6) M) blocked neurally evoked contractions of the IRBAs at 2, 4, and 8 Hz and of the ILAs at 2 and 4 Hz. (8 Hz responses were not entirely blocked in 3 out of 8 ILAs.) The sensitivity to exogenous NE decreased with a decrease in intrarenal vessel diameter, whereas the maximum active smooth muscle cell stress to NE was greater than 3 X 10(5) N/m2 for each vessel. All arterial segments constricted in response to histamine (H) and NE with equal maximal effects; however, sensitivity to H was greater in the smaller artery (ILA). The comparative contractile responses to nerve stimulation and exogenous NE in sequential renal arteries contrasts to the pattern of these responses in sequential arteries in any other rabbit regional bed previously studied (pulmonary and ear vasculature).", "PMC2202968": "Key aspects of developing a mutual self-help perinatal bereavement support group include planning for the logistics of the meeting, choosing a facilitator(s), informing the public and conducting the meeting.

Patient data were combined from two geographically distant laboratories. No significant variations in the patient profiles were encountered. Most patients were white (33 of 35) with a mean age of 45 years. The diagnosis was suspected on clinical grounds alone in only six of 35 patients before the echocardiogram was done. M-mode recordings were the primary echocardiographic modality available in the first 16 patients, whereas two-dimensional studies were also done in the others. Continuous and pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography were added in eight of the most recent studies. In one patient color flow imaging from both transthoracic and esophageal approaches was possible to better visualize a large left atrial tumor. Thirty-three patients had solitary tumors (29 left atrial, three right atrial, and one left ventricular), and two had multiple tumors. The most characteristic finding, as expected, was the demonstration of abnormal mass echoes produced by the myxoma tissue. Several interesting features not previously emphasized in the literature included abnormal notching of the interventricular septum and posterior left ventricular wall probably produced by displacement from the larger mobile left atrial tumors dropping into the mitral sleeve. This was best appreciated by the M-mode recordings. In one patient with an associated atrial septal defect, movement of the tumor into the defect appeared to alter the expected downward displacement into the mitral orifice. In the patients who were studied by two-dimensional, Doppler, or color flow imaging, tumor movement was evidenced by abnormal frequency shifts, and dispersion of flow around the tumor mass was readily appreciated. Surgical removal was performed in all patients. Follow-up echocardiograms were done postoperatively ranging up to 17 years.

The resultant reconstructed coordinates agreed well with each other. The uncertainties in precision for the coordinates were expressed as the standard deviation of the measurements. The standard deviation of the computer and manual measurements agreed well with predicted values by an analysis of the random uncertainties in the reconstruction parameters. The uncertainties were within 0.2 mm for the coordinates parallel to the plan of the film and were within 0.4 mm for the coordinate perpendicular to the plane of the shift film.

We found that 33% of the patients with symptoms did not have pathologic GER, and 25% of the patients without symptoms had pathologic GER. Characteristic changes of impaired motility in the esophagus were found in 46 patients. When combining esophageal manometry, reflux measurement, and symptoms of GER, we found a positive correlation in 60% of patients with reduced peristalsis in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus and GER.

For stem spermatogonia, a significant increase in cell survival accompanied the reduction in dose-rate, and this was characterized by an increase of the Do for the derived survival curves from 2.86 +/- 0.29 Gy at 112 cGy X min-1 to 4.46 +/- 0.45 Gy at 1.1 cGy X min-1. The data were analysed using two mathematical models for repair at varying dose-rates, the LPL model of Curtis and the incomplete repair model of Thames. Using these models the half-time for repair was estimated to lie between 15 and 25 min. No dose-rate effects were observed for the differentiated spermatogonia.

We previously found that EBV-negative and EBV-carrying BL lines derived from HLA-A11-positive donors were not only resistant to lysis by the HLA-A11-restricted CTL generated by stimulation with the autologous LCL, but also to HLA-A11-specific CTL derived from lymphocytes of an EBV-seronegative donor stimulated with an allogeneic LCL. Using the same and additional cell lines, we now show that the CTL resistance of the BL lines is probably due to a selective down-regulation of HLA-A11. We also show that the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein is expressed at a lower level in the EBV-carrying BL lines than in EBV-transformed LCLs. Only one of eight in vitro EBV-converted BL lines that shifted to a more LCL-like growth pattern expressed LMP at a high level. This line also reexpressed the HLA-A11 antigen that was undetectable in its EBV-negative progenitor. Our findings suggest that the typical BL cell phenotype is associated with low expression of both proteins.", "PMC3983379": "Two cases are presented in which transverse esophageal folds were observed in children following ingestion of corrosive material. Strictures developed at the sites that initially manifested this serrated mucosal appearance. These findings lend additional credence to the concept that transverse folds, reflecting contractions of the muscularis mucosae, represent a pattern of pathologic motility rather than merely a variant of normal mucosal anatomy.", "PMC3373404": "One hundred twenty-two preterm infants were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PVH-IVH). Before random assignment, data on the infants were stratified according to low-weight (500 to 999 g) or high-weight (1000 to 1500 g) subgroups. Cranial sonography was used to document the absence of PVH-IVH before enrollment and the occurrence of PVH-IVH during the 7-day protocol. Indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg, or placebo was administered before 12 hours of age and at 24, 48, and 72 hours of age. Five patients receiving indomethacin and six receiving placebo were withdrawn before completion of the study. In the remaining 111 patients, the indomethacin and placebo groups were comparable with respect to gestational ages, maternal complications, Apgar scores, ventilatory requirements, complications of prematurity, and mortality rate. PVH-IVH developed in six of 56 infants who received indomethacin and 11 of 55 infants who received placebo (P = 0.174). Analysis of the individual strata showed that the indomethacin-treated infants in the low-weight subgroup sustained a higher mortality rate (11/17 vs 3/16; P = 0.008) without a reduction in the incidence of PVH-IVH. Infants in the indomethacin-treated high-weight subgroup demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of PVH-IVH (2/39 vs 8/39; P = 0.04), but the frequency of high-grade hemorrhages was comparable for both indomethacin- and placebo-treated groups. In summary, the prophylactic administration of intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of PVH-IVH cannot be recommended for infants less than 1000 g. In preterm infants between 1000 and 1500 g birth weight, indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of PVH-IVH.", "PMC3515335": "The use of smooth and threaded pins for internal fixation is often complicated by component migration, especially when employed about the acromioclavicular joint.

This result is compared with other attractors seen in normal human brain dynamics. A sudden jump is observed between the dimensionalities of these brain attractors (4.05 +/- 0.05 for deep sleep) and the very low dimensionality of the epileptic state (2.05 +/- 0.09). The evaluation of the autocorrelation function and of the largest Lyapunov exponent allows us to sharpen further the main features of underlying dynamics.

Drawing upon reports of what we call here association learning and memory in humans and animals, it is shown that this type of learning remains intact and may be mediated by subcortical brain structures, despite the often severe cognitive blunting which accompanies diffuse cortical brain damage. In retarded humans the application of association learning-based behaviour modification techniques may lead to the development of an adequate behavioural base-line on which to develop cognitive rehabilitation programmes. The implications of potentially valid neuropsychological extrapolations from animals to man are discussed. Finally suggestions are made concerning the interaction between association learning and more cognitive information-processing strategies, and the implications for behaviour modifications with retarded and head injured are considered.", "PMC3032205": "Adriamycin (ADR) increased the lipid fluidity of dog brain synaptosomal plasma membranes (SPM) labeled with 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), as indicated by the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy [(ro/r)-1]-1. Arrhenius-type plots of [(ro/r)-1]-1 indicated that the lipid phase separation of the membrane at 23.3 +/- 1.2 degrees was perturbed by ADR such that the temperature was reduced to 16.2 +/- 1.1 degrees. Arrhenius plots of (Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATPase activity exhibited a break point at 22.8 +/- 1.1 degrees in control SPM which was reduced to 15.8 +/- 1.0 degrees in ADR treated SPM, suggesting differences in the interaction of (Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATPase with lipids between ADR treated and untreated SPM. (Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATPase and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activities were increased at a concentration range 10(-18)-10(-15) M of ADR; higher concentrations (up to 10(-7) M), however, led to a progressive inhibition of the enzyme activities. The allosteric properties of SPM-bound (Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATPase by fluoride (F-) (as reflected by changes in the Hill coefficient) were modulated by ADR whereas those of SPM-bound acetylcholinesterase remained unaffected. We propose that ADR achieves these effects through asymmetric perturbations of the membrane lipid structure and that changes in membrane fluidity may be an early key event in ADR induced neurotoxicity.", "PMC2527684": "An external quality assessment scheme is described for on-ward testing of blood glucose by nursing staff using the Glucometer II/Glucostix system.

BN.1L E were shown to carry at least the same quantity of LEW MHC antigens on their surface as LEW E, thus the failure to prolong LEW kidney graft survival is due to the absence of LEW non-MHC antigens from BN.1L E. Attempts to substitute for this deficiency by mixing LEW.1N E to BN.1L E prior to transfusion failed to restore the beneficial effect, demonstrating that donor E-mediated prolonged renal allograft survival requires the presence of both MHC and non-MHC alloantigens on the same E.", "PMC3196219": "Incubation of cultured arterial smooth muscle cells with large concentrations of low density lipoproteins (LDL) resulted in a net increase in cell cholesterol and cholesteryl ester mass that was dependent on LDL concentration and time of incubation. Use of an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT) reduced the accumulation of cholesteryl ester mass by 40% (range 25% to 50%), suggesting that a significant proportion of the cholesteryl ester mass that accumulated from LDL did so without being hydrolyzed and re-esterified. Quiescent arterial smooth muscle cells exposed for 48 hours to 0.5 mg/ml of 125I-LDL accumulated 115 nmol total sterol/mg cell protein. However, these cells took up and degraded only 21 micrograms of 125I-LDL protein, which contains 64 nmol total cholesterol. Hence, only about 60% of the increase in cell-associated cholesterol mass was accounted for by LDL particle uptake and degradation. Further, when cells were incubated with 3H cholesteryl linoleyl ether-labeled LDL, the net increase of total cell cholesterol was 81 nmol/mg cell protein. However, only 49 nmol of total cholesterol was taken up by LDL particle uptake, as calculated from the uptake of the 3H cholesteryl linoleyl ether tracer. It thus appears that about 40% of the accumulated cholesterol mass was derived independent of LDL particle uptake, suggesting the possibility of transfer of free cholesterol from the surface of LDL to the cell surface. The occurrence of cholesterol surface transfer was independently verified by the measurement of the uptake and cellular distribution of LDL-derived free 3H-cholesterol. A substantial fraction of the accumulated cell cholesterol mass (approximately 40%) was derived from surface transfer of LDL free cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC57815": "A double blind trial of bromocriptine in the treatment of 14 patients with the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy is reported. 5 patients did not complete the trial mainly because of side-effects due to an overdosage of bromocriptine.

In contrast, the two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis patterns could not distinguish between the DRB1 gene products of the HLA-DRw17 and DRw18 cells. Two DRB3 variants, correlating with the T-cell defined specificities Dw24 and Dw25 were identified at the genomic and product level. Of ten haplotypes studied with the newly defined HLA-DRw18 specificity, all had the DRB3 RFLP pattern associated with Dw24. HLA-DRw17 was found in all three population groups tested, although in the SA Negroes HLA-DRw18 was the prevalent DR3 subgroup.

The stimulus is conventionally thought to be the hydrogen ion concentration in the area's extracellular fluid. It is pointed out, however, that the elegant studies by Loeschcke & Ahmad have demonstrated that [pH]e and [pH]i are normally tightly and rapidly coupled (Loeschcke & Ahmad, 1980). For this reason, the stimulus might just as well be the intracellular hydrogen ion concentration in the chemoreceptor area. The administration of acetazolamide allows the dissociation of [pH]e from [pH]i. With acetazolamide a sharp acid shift of CSF pH [( pH]c) is measured and in two consonance with this shift a marked increase in CBF is seen. Comparing these two reactions to that obtained with CO2 breathing, it is apparent that 7% CO2 causes about the same decrease in [pH]e and the same increase in CBF. In other words CBF acidosis can quantitatively account for the CBF increase induced by acetazolamide. But CO2 and acetazolamide influence [pH]i quite differently, as CO2 drops [pH]i to almost the same extent as [pH]c, while two recent studies by MR spectroscopy have shown that acetazolamide does not drop [pH]i measurably, if tissue hypercapnia is prevented in artificially ventilated rabbits or by the mild spontaneous hyperventilation caused by acetazolamide in normal man.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2635562": "It is not unusual to find patients who have lost posterior teeth or who are totally toothless, approaching our dental surgeon colleagues in cases of difficulties, and even prosthetic impossibility, nearly always associated or in relation with skeletic maxilo-mandibular imbalance.

Among the chymotryptic peptides obtained from the reduced and S-carboxymethylated enzymes, only peptides C-3 were different from each other in terms of chromatographic behaviour on reverse-phase h.p.l.c. On the basis of chemical analyses of these peptides, it was shown that RNAase U2-B had an isopeptide bond in which Asp-32 was linked to Gly-33 through the beta-carboxy group in its side chain instead of the alpha-carboxy group. Deamidation of Asn-32 in RNAase U2-A led to the formation of this unusual linkage. The previously reported sequence of RNAase U2 [Sato & Uchida (1975) Biochem. J. 145, 353-360] was corrected by changing amino acid residues at eight different positions and by inserting an asparagine residue at position 32. The numbering of the positions of amino acid residues located downstream of Asn-32 was therefore shifted by 1. Accordingly, RNAase U2-A was shown to be composed of 114 amino acid residues.", "PMC2737311": "From the data in the literature it can be seen that 40% of the surgical population has insufficient postoperative analgesia. Many reasons have been given for this: pain control delegated to the doctor on duty and/or the nursing staff; administration of drugs 'on demand', if the patient asks for them, or the nurses feel it to be necessary; fear of causing side effects such as respiratory insufficiency; or provoking addiction by giving narcotics. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the intensity of pain, the side effects, the degree of activity, anxiety, feeling of weakness and the mood of patients surgically treated for oncological diseases of the thorax and upper abdomen, comparing two different antalgic approaches. Thirty-five patients were studied. Pain was treated on demand with a narcotic, or an anti-inflammatory drug, or not treated at all; 20 patients were treated with analgesics given at predetermined hours, following the regime: methadone 10 mg intramuscularly (i.m.) every 12 h from the first to the third day following surgery and sodium diclofenac 75 mg (i.m.) every 12 h from the fourth to the seventh day. Results showed that patients treated with analgesics given intramuscularly at fixed hours have a significantly better pain control during the whole week of treatment (P less than 0.001), on average sleep more (P less than 0.001), spend more time standing or sitting and fewer hours lying down (P less than 0.001), have a higher performance status and feel less weak (P less than 0.05) than the group of patients treated with drugs 'on demand', or not treated at all.", "PMC4036375": "In order to find out how far center hemodialysis (ZD) and limited-care hemodialysis (LCD) influence adjustment and being of the afflicted persons, 21 ZD-patients and 19 LCD-patients were examined psychodiagnostically with the following tests: Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study, Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale (adapted to German conditions), and Freiburger Personlichkeits-Inventar. By means of statistical analysis it could be shown that the hemodialysis patients do not present themselves to their fellow-men in accordance with their real thinking and feeling.

Stimulus-response functions, late receptor potential (LRP) as function of the stimulus light intensity were measured before bleach and in a steady state after dark adaptation. It was shown that accumulation of LPO products influenced dark adaptation in photoreceptors. Based on the displacements of the stimulus-response curves and experimental measurement data on the rate of LRP collapse after retina treatment with strophanthin it is concluded that the most probable mechanism of such an influence lies in a change of photoreceptor plasma membrane permeability.", "PMC4924999": "The activity of a new semisynthetic penicillin, alpha-carboxyl-3-thienylmethyl penicillin (BRL-2288) was determined against 535 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli, by using the tube dilution technique.

It was slightly more active than carbenicillin or 6-(d-alpha-sulfoaminophenylacetamido)-penicillanic acid against Pseudomonas sp., with over half of the isolates being inhibited by 50 mug or less of BRL-2288 per ml. Isolates of Klebsiella sp. were routinely resistant to this antibiotic. The drug was bactericidal against most sensitive organisms. BRL-2288 was less active against large inocula.

Trophotaeniae are ribbon-like external projections of the embryonic gut that are equivalent to greatly hypertrophied intestinal villi. During gestation within the ovarian lumen, trophotaeniae are directly apposed to the internal ovarian epithelium (IOE) where they establish a placental association between the developing embryo and maternal organism. Trophotaenial absorptive cells possess an ALPase reactive brush border, an endocytotic apparatus, and ACPase reactive standing lysosomes. Ultrastructural studies of protein uptake indicate that cells of the trophotaenial epithelium take up HRP by micropinocytosis and degrade it within lysosomes. Initially (from 1.5-10 min), HRP is taken up in vitro at 22 degrees C at the apical cell surface and passes via endocytotic vesicles into an apical canalicular system. From 1.5 to 10 min exposure, HRP passes passes from the apical canalicular system to a series of small collecting vesicles. After 10 min, HRP is detected within large ACPase reactive supranuclear lysosomes. Three hours after an initial 1 h exposure to HRP, most peroxidase activity within supranuclear lysosomes is no longer detected. Presence of Golgi complexes, residual bodies, and secretory granules in the infranuclear cytoplasm suggest that products of protein uptake and hydrolysis are discharged across basal and lateral cell surfaces and into the trophotaenial circulation. Trophotaeniae of embryos incubated in vitro in HRP-saline take up HRP at an initial rate of 13.5 ng HRP/mg trophotaenial protein/min. The system becomes saturated after 3 h. Trophotaeniae incubated at 4 degrees C show little or no uptake. In trophotaeniae continuously pulsed with HRP for 1 h, then incubated in HRP-free saline, levels of absorbed peroxidase declined at a rate of 0.5 ng/mg trophotaenial protein/min. HRP does not appear to enter the embryo via extra-trophotaenial routes. These findings are consistent with the putative role of trophotaeniae as the embryonic component of the functional placenta of goodeid fishes. Trophotaenial uptake of maternal nutrients accounts for a massive (15,000%) increase in embryonic dry weight during gestation.", "PMC3317810": "Inflammation is one of the cardinal clinical signs of rheumatic disease, although the pathogenesis of inflammation may differ from one such disease to another. The role played by inflammation in the diverse irreversible changes in the structure of the musculoskeletal system is probably also quite different. Despite this proviso, one of the prime tasks of clinical rheumatology is precise measurement of inflammation, because the information so acquired makes it possible to draw conclusions about the activity of the disease and assess the effect of therapeutic measures. Measurement of inflammation consists, fundamentally, of quantifying the classic symptoms of pain, swelling, heat, redness and limitation of movement. All attempts to measure inflammation by means of a single parameter, for instance of a humoral type (acute phase proteins), or by a single method (scintiscanning with radionuclides or thermography) have failed sooner or later. The only practical approach is to measure a number of subjective and objective parameters. With all these methods, sensitivity and reproducibility are crucial to success. In rheumatoid arthritis, the major rheumatic disease, various authors have compiled indices on the basis of individual parameters: number of painful joints, number of swollen joints, grip strength, duration of morning stiffness, a number of function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (or other humoral inflammation parameters), a special pain measurement (pain scale) and subjective evaluation of the rheumatic condition by the physician and the patient.", "PMC3677922": "We have investigated transcription of the histone gene cluster on lampbrush chromosomes of the newt Notophthalmus viridescens. Clusters of the five histone genes are separated by long tracts of a DNA repeat called satellite 1. Previous in situ hybridization results demonstrated the presence of histone gene coding regions, intergene spacers, and flanking satellite repeats in giant transcription units on lampbrush chromosomes. These results suggested a model in which transcription initiates at histone gene promoters and continues through the rest of the gene cluster into satellite repeats. The readthrough transcription model predicts that spacer regions upstream of the first promoter in the gene cluster should be absent from nascent transcripts on chromosome loops. We have used such upstream spacer probes for in situ hybridization to lampbrush chromosomes. Contrary to our expectation, the results show that upstream spacer regions are transcribed, and indicate that transcription often initiates upstream of the first histone gene promoter.

The highest injury rate was observed in the hypoglossal nerve (8.6%), followed by the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve (6.2%) and the vagus nerve with its superior and recurrent laryngeal branches (3.7% of cases). Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve and the greater auricular nerve occurs very rarely.

It promotes thrombocyte aggregation and contracts the blood vessels. TXA2 appears to be a specific physiological thrombotic agent. Synthesis of TXA2 is elevated in patients with diabetes mellitus of types I and II and in hypertensive patients. TXA2 has a half-life of about 30 s under physiological conditions. Prostacyclin (PGI2) is formed in the vessel walls. Its action is antagonistic to TXA2, that is, it inhibits platelet aggregation and dilates the blood vessels. Synthesis of PGI2 is depressed in the presence of the classical 4 main risk factors for atherosclerosis: arterial hypertension, hyperlipoproteinaemia, smoking and diabetes mellitus. PGI2 has a half-life of about 3 min under physiological conditions. Since TXA2 and PGI2 are very labile and thus extremely difficult to measure, it is at present usual to measure their stable metabolites thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha). Radioimmunological measurement (RIA) of TXB2 in plasma requires no preliminary work, but radioimmunological measurement of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in plasma requires prior extraction and concentrating, since the concentration of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the plasma is usually below the detection limit of commercial RIA kits.

U78517F inhibited 200 microM FeCl2-initiated lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates by 50% at a concentration of 0.6 microM compared with 8 microM for U74006F, 28 microM for alpha-tocopherol, and 43 microM for the ring portion of alpha-tocopherol (i.e., trolox). U78517F is devoid of hypothermic or antiexcitotoxic actions or interactions with known neurotransmitter receptors. When administered intraperitoneally to male gerbils at 10 minutes before and again at the end of a 3-hour period of unilateral carotid artery occlusion, U78517F decreased 24-hour postischemic cortical neuronal necrosis. Neuronal density in the medial portion of the cortex was increased from 34.2% of normal in vehicle-treated animals to 86.3% in the U78517F-treated animals. In the lateral cortical area, the vehicle group showed only 3.3% neuronal survival versus 48.2% in the drug-treated group. In a separate series of experiments with the same focal ischemia model, identical dosing with U78517F enhanced the postischemic recovery of cortical extracellular calcium without any effect on ischemic or postischemic cortical blood flow. The effect on calcium recovery was observed at intraperitoneal doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg. The compound also was effective in partially attenuating 1-week postischemic hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss in a gerbil global ischemia model involving brief (15-minute) bilateral carotid occlusion, but sustained dosing was required.

However, the condition can be misdiagnosed as chronic suppurative otitis media, since intermittent purulent discharge is the commonest symptom in both disorders. Although the clinical features of myringitis granulosa have been well described by several authors, its pathogenesis is still obscure. In this study, 40 cases of myringitis granulosa were examined in detail to clarify the clinical features and the pathogenesis present. No drum perforations, no hearing impairments and normal X-ray findings indicated that myringitis granulosa had no relation to chronic suppurative otitis media. The other areas of the affected tympanic membrane, except for the site of granulation, showed such pathologic conditions as atrophy, clouding and calcifications. In these pathologic tympanic membranes, epithelial migration was disturbed to a high degree. We suggest that the granulation process on the tympanic membrane should be divided into two stages: (1) injury reaching the lamina propria of the tympanic membrane; and (2) disturbed epithelization of the tympanic membrane. The disturbance of epithelial migration of the tympanic membrane occurs with both stages.", "PMC2237997": "One frequently cited barrier to more widespread adoption of family planning in Moslem countries is religious opposition.

For AchR-rich membranes equilibrated with 1-AP, irradiation at 365 nm resulted in covalent incorporation in all four AchR subunits with each of the subunits incorporating approximately equal amounts of label. To identify the regions of the AchR subunits that incorporated 1-AP, subunits were digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and trypsin, and the resulting fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. N-terminal sequence analysis identified the hydrophobic segments M1, M3, and M4 within each subunit as containing the sites of labeling. The labeling pattern of 1-AP in the alpha-subunit was compared with that of another hydrophobic photoactivatable probe, 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID). The nonspecific component of [125I]TID labeling [White, B., Howard, S., Cohen, S. G., & Cohen, J.B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21595-21607] was restricted to the same regions as those labeled by 1-AP. The [125I]TID residues labeled in the hydrophobic segment M4 were identified as Cys-412, Met-415, Cys-418, Thr-422, and Val-425. The periodicity and distribution of labeled residues establish that the M4 region is alpha-helical in nature and indicate that M4 presents a broad face to membrane lipid.", "PMC2136583": "The focus of this preliminary study is the impact of family and individual factors on diabetes control for the adolescent. Adolescents between the age of 15 and 18 years and their parents participated in this study. Questionnaires completed by subjects included FACES III, FILE, Social Support Inventory, and the Kvebaek Family Sculptures. Diabetic control was determined by measuring glycosylated hemoglobin. Subjects were asked to identify how they perceived family cohesion, family dysfunction, relationship distance, and social support. Initial analysis, utilizing bivariate correlations because of the small sample size, revealed statistically significant correlations between the adolescent's perception of family cohesion and diabetes control. Moreover, the more dysfunctional the parents perceived the family system, the worse the diabetic control of the adolescent. Adolescents with better diabetic control had fathers who perceived a greater distance between the mother-father relationship as well as a greater distance between the ideal father-patient relationship. Patients who perceived their mothers as nonsupportive experienced worse diabetic control. Yet patients who perceived they had more social support experienced better control of their diabetes. The more disengaged the family system, the worse the diabetic control for the adolescent.", "PMC3042359": "Urapidil is a phenylpiperazine-substituted uracil derivative used in hypertension.

Accumulation of (14)C-glycerol was almost completely absent in uninduced cells and in a transport-negative mutant. Kinetic studies with induced cells suggested that glycerol may be transported by two systems with different affinities for glycerol. Osmotically shocked cells did not transport glycerol, and the supernatant fluid from shocked cells contained glycerol-binding activity demonstrable by equilibrium dialysis. The binding protein was not glycerol kinase. Binding activity was absent in shock fluids from the transport-negative mutant and from uninduced cells. The glycerol-binding protein was partially purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Mild heat treatment completely eliminated the binding activity of shock fluid and of the partially purified protein. Sodium azide and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited both transport by whole cells and binding of glycerol by shock fluid. It is concluded that transport of glycerol by P. aeruginosa involves a binding protein responsible for recognition of glycerol and may occur by facilitated diffusion or active transport. A requirement for energy has not been demonstrated.", "PMC3499460": "The role of protein kinase C (PK-C) in triggering the lytic response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) has been examined. Both target cell lysis and the release of CTL-associated serine esterase (SE), a marker for cytotoxic granules, were used as indicators of the CTL lytic response. We found triggering of the CTL lytic response occurred when both a PK-C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and a calcium ionophore, ionomycin, were added to CTL. The previously described inactivation of the CTL lytic response by long term treatment (24 hr) with PMA was also investigated. CTL cultured with PMA for 24 hr were unable to mediate target cell lysis or release SE; this inability to respond correlated with an absence of PK-C activity. Incubation of the PMA-treated CTL in the absence of PMA for an additional 24 hr resulted in recovery of PK-C activity, SE release, and the lytic response. These experiments strongly suggest that PK-C is involved with the transmembrane signaling required for SE release which is a necessary event in CTL-mediated target cell lysis.", "PMC3325275": "Over 80 per cent of ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without incident. Sharp (bones, pins, needles, wire) or long (greater than 6.5 cm) foreign bodies are most commonly implicated in perforation.

Adults with nonfood foreign bodies have a high incidence of psychiatric, social, or chemical derangements. Pediatric patients most commonly ingest coins. Ingestions tend to occur during nonschool months or in high-risk situations, and repeat ingestions are not uncommon. Fatalities and other major complications are linked to type of foreign body, location, and duration of the impaction. Deaths have also occurred with endoscopic and enzymatic modalities of treatment.

We have proposed that some step(s) in axon growth require production of GAP-43, and perhaps a small number of other \"growth-associated proteins,\" at rates much higher than those typical of mature neurons. This hypothesis predicts that virtually all neurons synthesize GAP-43 at elevated levels during normal CNS development. Here we show that a protein similar to GAP-43 from regenerating toad nerves is prominent among the newly synthesized (35S-methionine-labeled) and total (Coomassie blue-stained) proteins in neonatal rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that synthesis of GAP-43 is indeed a common feature of many developing neurons. Synthesis and accumulation of the protein decline an order of magnitude as animals mature. Antibodies raised against the rat cortex GAP-43 also recognize electrophoretically similar proteins from regenerating toad optic nerves and from developing hamster sensorimotor cortex, indicating that structural features of GAP-43 are conserved in evolution. Cell-free translation of polyadenylated RNA from neonatal and adult cortex suggests that developmental regulation of GAP-43 synthesis is mediated largely through changes in mRNA abundance. These observations together suggest that developmental regulation of GAP-43 gene expression may be common to most vertebrate CNS neurons. GAP-43 remains detectable at a low level in adult rat cortex, and it co-migrates on two-dimensional gels with B-50, a synaptic membrane protein which is a preferred substrate for protein kinase C in adult brains. Phosphorylation of the protein by endogenous kinase(s) in vitro is 4-7-fold greater in growth cone membranes than in mature synaptic membranes, which raises the possibility that local modification of the protein in axon terminals may be synergistic with regulation of GAP-43 synthesis in the cell body.", "PMC4071840": "Because conflicting results have been obtained in studies of the hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) microcirculation following rapid decompression, we were interested in the origin of bubbles in the cheek-pouch preparation. The hamster cheek-pouch and surgically exposed femoral vessels were observed under the microscope, before and immediately following rapid decompression. The animals were placed in a hyperbaric chamber and exposed to an increased pressure of 7 ATA for 1 h. They were then decompressed at a rate of 18 m/min until reaching 1 ATA. This hyperbaric exposure produced an LD50 in 100 hamsters examined in this study. In 40% of these animals \"bubbles\" were seen entering the cheek-pouch artery after a delay of from 3 to 6 min following decompression. Before observing bubbles in the cheek-pouch artery, bubbles were always seen in the femoral vein. Those animals that had observable bubbles in the cheek-pouch usually demonstrated a tachypnea, followed by gasping and apnea. When bubbles were seen in the arterial circulation, few animals survived for more than 10 min following the hyperbaric exposure. Postmortem examination of these animals revealed massive gas emboli in the large venous vessels, right ventricle, and fewer bubbles in the left ventricle. Postmortem examination of surviving animals revealed that the majority of the gas was in the venous vessels and right heart. These data support the hypothesis that bubbles first form on the venous side of the circulation and, if they exceed a certain volume, move through the pulmonary circulation into the systemic arterial vessels.", "PMC3009351": "Monoclonal antibodies against SDS-disrupted bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) were obtained from hybridomas prepared by fusing mouse myeloma cell line P3X63Ag8U1 with spleen cells from immunized BALB/c mice. Six hybridoma cell lines were obtained after testing supernatant fluids for positivity by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the immunogen as antigen and by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) on frozen sections of BPV1-induced bovine fibropapillomas. Monoclonal antibodies (AU1-AU6) from these hybridomas were then tested for reactivity by IF tests on BPV2-induced fibropapillomas and on human plantar warts and vulvar condylomas and by avidin-biotin complex tests on sections of formalin-fixed cervical dysplasias. One monoclonal antibody (AU1) was reactive with all tissues, four (AU3-AU6) were reactive with both BPV1 and BPV2 fibropapillomas, and the remaining antibody (AU2) was only reactive with BPV1-induced fibropapillomas. All monoclonal antibodies reacted with the major capsid protein (mol. wt. 54,000) of BPV1, whereas five (AU1, AU3-AU6) reacted with the major capsid protein of BPV2.

A single peak of an alkaline protease was subsequently obtained with a 9-fold increase in specific activity and a final recovery value of 26.2%. The enzyme had optimal activity at 37 degrees C and a pH of 7.8. The enzyme did not degrade leucine amide, hippurylphenylalanine and hippurylarginine indicating lack of exo-protease activity.

The entire population of muscarinic receptors was labeled with [3H]quinuclidinyl-benzilate; the M1 receptor subtype was labeled with [3H]pirenzepine; and the density of the M2 receptor subtype was estimated by subtracting the density of M1 receptors from the total population. The overall density of M1 and M2 receptor subtypes was similar throughout the cerebral cortex. However, their laminar distribution varied regionally. In cortical regions of the parietal and occipital lobes and in the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe, both M1 and M2 receptor subtypes were concentrated in the supragranular layers. By contrast, in prefrontal cortical areas, the combined population of M1 and M2 receptors was evenly distributed across the cortical layers, though M1 receptors were most dense and M2 receptors least dense in layer IV. The difference in the distribution of cholinergic receptors in the prefrontal cortex compared to other neocortical areas reveals a degree of chemoarchitectural specificity of this region with respect to cholinergic markers that has escaped immunohistochemical and other anatomical and functional techniques.", "PMC2106609": "The Philips SL25 accelerator is a multimodality machine offering asymmetric collimator jaws and a new type of beam bending and transport system.

With this approach, changes in the hard and soft tissue components were concomitantly demonstrated; the method enabled preservation of the in situ relationship between these components. Following laser surgery, healing in the gingiva was delayed as suggested by the presence of epithelial ulcerations and dense inflammatory infiltrate. In the enamel and cementum the application of laser resulted in crater-like defects that could be avoided only partially by insertion of a tinfoil shield into the gingival sulcus. In the vicinity of the cementoenamel junction these defects were filled with epithelium or periodontal ligament fibers; the close proximity of the hard and soft tissues at the defect sites suggested occurrence of new attachment. Enamel defects located coronal to the gingiva contained bacterial plaque. These histologic results do not demonstrate any substantial advantage of laser over conventional knife gingivectomy. Such advantage may be accomplished with the design of a special intraoral handpiece and further experiments.", "PMC3958746": "A 34-year-old homosexual male developed cryptococcal meningitis as the initial manifestation of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

Fc gamma R expression is regulated by IFN-gamma. Because IFN-gamma and IL-4 have antagonistic effects on the expression of the FcR for IgE on human monocytes, we studied the effect of IL-4 on Fc gamma R expression and function. We show that IL-4 down-regulates Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII expression of cultured monocytes and inhibits IFN-gamma enhanced Fc gamma RI expression. Exposure of monocytes to IL-4 for 40 h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of the expression of all three Fc gamma R that persisted throughout the whole culture period (7 days). Anti-IL-4 antibodies completely reversed the IL-4 effect. In addition the impaired Fc gamma R expression correlated directly with reduced Fc gamma R-mediated function because monocytes cultured in the presence of IL-4 have a reduced capacity to lyse human E opsonized with human IgG anti-D or mouse antiglycophorin A antibodies. These observations, together with the previous finding that IL-4 induces Fc epsilon RIIb expression on monocytes, indicate that IL-4 and IFN-gamma may control the Fc gamma R-mediated immune response by differentially regulating Fc gamma R expression.", "PMC3669367": "An autopsy case of primary gastric choriocarcinoma in a 55-year-old male is presented. The tumor was diagnosed as choriocarcinoma of the stomach from a histological examination of biopsy specimens. The level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was significantly increased in the serum and urine. A histological examination of autopsy specimens showed the tumor of the stomach to be a pure choriocarcinoma composed of syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts with a mixture of eosinophilic necrotic tissues, but with no elements of adenocarcinoma. The tumor showed metastases and/or invasions to the liver, lungs, pancreas, omentum, pleura, peritoneum and lymph nodes. Positive immuno-histochemical staining for the beta-subunit of HCG (HCG-beta) in the gastric tumor was demonstrated in the form of granular diffuse deposits in the cytoplasm of trophoblasts and predominated in syncytiotrophoblasts over transitional cells. Under electron microscopic observation, positive immunostaining for HCG-beta was observed in the perinuclear space, cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and secretory vesicles of syncytiotrophoblasts and transitional cells.", "PMC3013641": "Not only mitogen stimulation or mitogen stimulation in combination with interleukin 2 (IL2) was capable of causing susceptibility of human T lymphocytes to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, but also selective stimulation with recombinant Il2-induced permissiveness of T lymphocytes to HSV infection. Replication of HSV in such IL2-stimulated T cell cultures was shown to be restricted to a T cell subset not exceeding 5% of the total population. Furthermore, IL2 stimulation was sufficient to obtain virus replication in T cells previously infected by HSV and cultivated for several days. This could not be achieved by stimulation with mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin. The level at which virus replication was restricted in nonpermissive T cells was determined to be before immediate early gene expression as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies against viral proteins expressed at different stages of the viral replicative cycle.", "PMC3192921": "In recent years chronic infection by the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) has become an important cause of chronic liver disease among drug addicts. To evaluate the influence of addiction to i.v. drugs on the course of this disease we have analyzed the clinical, histopathological, virological and evolutive features in 18 addicts and 11 non-addicts with chronic delta infection. Recent acute hepatitis D, documented as HDV superinfection, was observed in 14 addicts (77%) and in 2 non-addicts (18%) (P less than 0.02). At the time of evaluation for chronic liver disease, the frequency of symptoms, the degree of biochemical disturbances and the histopathological severity were similar in the two groups but the duration of HDV infection was probably shorter in drug addicts. HBV replication, as indicated by the presence of HBeAg and HBV-DNA in serum and HBcAg in liver, was more frequent in addicts. The amount of HDAg in liver tissue was also greater in addicts (P less than 0.005). Antibodies against the human immunodeficiency virus were detected in all of the addicts (P less than 0.001). Although most patients remained asymptomatic, significant histological worsening occurred in one half of the cases after a relatively short period of follow-up (25.1 +/- 16.3 months). The tendency to deteriorate in addicts (61% of cases) was greater than in non-addicts (36%). These observations suggest that the prognosis of chronic HDV infection is particularly poor in drug addicts in whom rapid deterioration may be related to simultaneous and inadequately controlled replication of hepatotropic viruses.", "PMC2717436": "Fourteen primigravidas were evaluated at 32 and 36 weeks antepartum (AP) and 6 weeks postpartum (PP) to test the reliability and validity of a digital measure of pelvic muscle strength using urine control as the criterion.

Convergent validity was shown by negative correlations between clinical muscle scores and time required to interrupt urine flow at 32 weeks AP (r = -.41), 36 weeks AP (r = -.64) and 6 weeks PP (r = -.71). Validity was also demonstrated in a pattern of lower scores in women who had urine loss during coughing or reported incontinence as compared with those who did not.

We sought evidence to determine whether contractions of the smooth muscle of the guinea pig vas deferens to ATP are in response to ATP4- or its bidentate complexes. Contractions to ATP were elicited in seven modified Krebs-Henseleit solutions containing varied concentrations of free and total Mg2+ and Ca2+ to alter the concentration of ATP4- at given ATPtotal concentrations. As the concentration of Mg2+ increased the concentration of ATP required to stimulate contraction to an equivalent degree also increased. Regardless of the free or total Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations, response magnitude was generally correlated with [ATP4-]. This suggests that ATP4- is the agonist at the P2x purinoceptor of the guinea pig vas deferens. The potency of ATP4- is high; the threshold, occurring at approximately 1 nM ATP4-, is 1000-fold less than that for norepinephrine. The implications of ATP4- as agonist are discussed in relation to adenine nucleotide potency, metabolism and P2 purinoceptor classification.", "PMC3963256": "Intravenous sodium lactate was given to seven patients with primary depression and secondary panic attacks and 26 patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks.

Geographical variations in the distribution of cadmium between organs indicate that the dietary uptake of cadmium is predominant in northern mainland and Orkney crabs, but that uptake from the water is more important in the south of Scotland. Mean dissolved cadmium concentrations in eastern coastal water increase from approximately 10 ng dm-3 in northern waters to approximately 25 ng dm-3 in the south.

The present study shows that the same protocol works not only for hearts but also for kidneys. A total of 59 renal allografts were carried out in various combinations between LEW and ACI rats. The recipients were submitted to bilateral nephrectomy at the time of graft implantation and host splenectomy 3 days later. Graft function was assessed by survival time of the animals. In addition, BUN, creatinine, and hematocrit were measured in selected individuals. The following observations were made: 1) LEW kidneys were rejected at 92 +/- 65 days while ACI kidneys failed at 17 +/- 1.4 days (p less than 0.025). 2) Control animals without simultaneous syngenic functioning spleen implant rejected their LEW kidneys at 30.6 +/- 24.3 days (p less than 0.005). 3) Eleven rats never rejected their LEW kidneys (four single, seven twin grafts). 4) BUN, creatinine, and hematocrit differed significantly in rats with functioning kidneys compared to those in end stage renal failure (p less than 0.0005, p less than 0.0025, and p less than 10(-7) respectively).

Enzyme inactivated with N[3H]ethylmaleimide and inhibitory ternary complex (formed with native enzyme, 5-[6-3H]fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate, and methylenetetrahydrofolate) served as reagents which were used to establish the conditions under which trichloroacetic acid precipitation, washing, and solubilization steps provided quantitative results. The ternary complex formed by dihydrofolate reductase with [3H]methotrexate and NADPH was used as a control to assess whether tight, but noncovalent, enzyme:ligand complexes survived trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The fact that no counts above background were detected in the pellet of precipitated protein demonstrated that the noncovalent complexes were completely dissociated by this treatment. The dynamic range of linear response for the inhibitory ternary complex of thymidylate synthase spanned five orders of magnitude, and the assay detected levels of enzyme as low as 10 fmol, a value which was essentially limited by the specific radioactivity of 5-[6-3H]fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate. The ability of the enzyme to bind 5-[6-3H]fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate specifically, as measured by the trichloroacetic acid assay, generated a specific binding value of 13.4 nmol of enzyme/mg protein (assuming a binding ratio of 1.5 for the inhibitory ternary complex). Specific binding values were compared to specific activity values (obtained from the spectrophotometric assay) at each stage of purification of the enzyme from Lactobacillus casei and were found to give parallel results. The characteristics of the trichloracetic acid assay procedure, which exclusively detects covalent enzyme-ligand adducts, are compared to those for other ligand binding assays for thymidylate synthase.", "PMC2542414": "Phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase is activated by growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), and is thought to be involved in cellular proliferation. Psoriasis is a hyperproliferative epidermal disease in which EGF receptor expression is altered and phospholipase C activity is increased. Considering the potential importance of growth factor stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism in the genesis of abnormal growth, we measured PI kinase activity in epidermal keratome biopsies from normal skin and the lesional and nonlesional skin of psoriatic patients. The PI kinase activity in 10 psoriatic involved plaques was increased 6.7-fold (Vmax = 67.1 +/- 23.9 pmol formed/min/mg protein +/- SE) when compared with 11 normal epidermal biopsies (Vmax = 10.0 +/- 1.3 pmol/min/mg protein, p less than 0.025). Similar results were noted when enzyme activity was standardized using DNA content. The apparent Km of PI kinase for ATP in involved psoriatic biopsies (0.45 +/- 0.14 mM) was also significantly (p less than 0.025) increased compared with normals (0.11 +/- 0.02 mM). The PI kinase activity in 11 biopsies of nonlesional psoriatic epidermis was not statistically different from normal epidermis. Both psoriatic and normal PI kinases required Mg++ and were inhibited by Ca++. The polyamine, spermine, a known activator of PI kinase in other tissues, stimulated normal but not psoriatic epidermal PI kinase. Both normal and psoriatic PI kinase activities had an apparent mol wt of 85,000.

The enhanced electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to flash were widely distributed over the scalp and were maximal at the central region; the occipital response preceded the frontocentral response by 3.4 to 5.1 msec. The interval from the frontocentral EEG response to the flash-evoked myoclonus was similar to that from the giant somatosensory evoked potential to the electrically evoked myoclonus. Investigation of recovery of evoked cortical responses and of myoclonic jerks showed a period of extremely enhanced excitability of both central and peripheral phenomena following stimulus. All of these findings suggest a cortical reflex mechanism. The role of the occipital cortex in the pathogenesis of photic cortical reflex myoclonus remains to be elucidated.", "PMC3905040": "The effect of whole body ionising radiation from a linear accelerator on rat tissue O6-methylguanine (O6-meG) methyltransferase (MT) activity has been assessed using an assay which measures the transfer of 3H-radioactivity from 3H-methylated substrate DNA to protein. The maximal effect occurred 2 days after a 1 krad dose, at which time activity in liver extracts was increased approximately 5-fold in two different rat strains. Activity in lung and kidney was increased approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively. Similar degrees of enhancement were found in these three tissues using an h.p.l.c. method for measuring MT activity. The increase in activity was reflected in an increased capacity to repair O6-meG produced in liver DNA by administration of [14C]dimethylnitrosamine (DMN): this effect was dose dependent, being detectable after 30 rads and maximal after 600 rads. Incorporation of labelled breakdown products of the DMN into adenine in DNA increased as the dose radiation increased suggesting an inhibition of DNA synthesis. The implications of these results for the mechanism of enhancing O6-meG repair are discussed.", "PMC3410877": "Transfection of the Ha-ras oncogene into a low metastatic epithelial cell line resulted in the acquirement of significantly increased metastatic capacity. This alteration in metastatic competence of a carcinoma line in a syngeneic system seemed to be a selective change and was not affected by parameters such as tumor latency period or local tumor growth. Transfection of the selection marker vectors with normal cellular DNA or with the N-ras gene did not lead to significantly increased metastatic capacity. Analysis of metastatic variants after oncogene transfection and in vivo selection showed integration of N-ras, but not of Ha-ras oncogenes. A possible role for the Ha-ras oncogene in the initial steps of metastasis will be discussed.", "PMC2478543": "Two endopeptidases are involved in the conversion of proinsulin; a type I activity directed at the B chain, Arg31,Arg32, C-peptide junction, and type II which cleaves the C-peptide, Lys64,Arg65, A chain junction. To define further the substrate specificities of these enzymes, a series of mutant preproinsulin cDNAs were generated by site-directed and deletion mutagenesis. These were inserted into pT7 plasmids and capped cRNA transcripts synthesized, that were then microinjected into Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were biosynthetically radiolabeled with [3H]leucine and the secreted peptides (greater than 95% present as unprocessed proinsulins) then incubated with types I and II endopeptidase activities prepared from isolated insulinoma secretory granules. The reaction products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Des-38-62-proinsulin, in which all but six amino acids of C-peptide were deleted was not processed by either enzyme. The mutant Lys64,Arg65 to Thr64,Arg65 was not cleaved by the type II enzyme but was still a substrate for the type I enzyme. The mutant Arg31,Arg32 to Arg31,Gly32 correspondingly was not cleaved by the type I enzyme; however, in this case it was not attacked by the type II enzyme. These results indicate that not only is the presence of a dibasic sequence essential, but also that the secondary structure of the protein is important in determining whether the prohormone is susceptible to proteolytic processing.", "PMC2761264": "Progesterone receptor (PgR) is known to be a significant indicator of hormone dependency of a breast tumor and also an important prognostic factor for recurrence and survival. Relatively low specific activity of tritium-labeled ligands makes it difficult to detect the presence of PgR in very small specimens and in specimens with low PgR content. We therefore undertook the synthesis of a radioiodinated progestin. We have synthesized unlabeled 17 alpha-(omega-haloalk-1'-ynyl)-19-nortestosterones with 4, 6, and 8 carbon side chains; these have high affinity for PgR and clear potential for conversion to a 125I form. Since the six-carbon side chain analogue had the highest relative PgR affinity (38% of the affinity of R5020, using PgR from T47D human breast cancer cells), it was selected for preparation of the 125I form by radiohalogen exchange of a omega-bromoalkynyl precursor with carrier-free Na125I. This new ligand was found by Scatchard analysis to have a Kd of 0.47 nM, as compared with [3H]R5020 at 0.22 nM and [3H]progesterone at 2.0 nM. (For affinity studies, all ligands were diluted in dimethylformamide and added to PgR-containing T47D cytosol to give a final DMF concentration of 4%, in order to prevent R5020 and the test compounds from binding nonspecifically to proteins and glass/plasticware.) The new 125I-ligand showed very little instability when stored in ethanol at approximately 10 degrees C even for several months. Thus, 17 alpha-(6'-[125I]iodohex-1'-ynyl)-19-nortestosterone should prove to be a useful ligand for high sensitivity PgR assays.", "PMC3988680": "We examined the relationship between the pressure-time product (Pdt) of the inspiratory muscles and the O2 cost of breathing (VO2 resp) in five normal subjects breathing through an external inspiratory resistance with a tidal volume of 800 ml at a constant end-expiratory lung volume [functional residual capacity, (FRC)]. Each subject performed 30-40 runs, each of approximately 30 breaths, with inspiratory flow rates ranging from 0.26 +/- 0.01 to 0.89 +/- 0.04 l/s (means +/- SE) and inspiratory mouth pressures ranging from 10 +/- 1 to 68 +/- 4% of the maximum inspiratory pressure at FRC. In all subjects VO2 resp was linearly related to Pdt when mean inspiratory flow (VI) was constant, but the slope of this relationship increased with increasing VI. Therefore, Pdt is an accurate index of VO2 resp only when VI is constant. There was a linear relationship between the VO2 resp and the work rate across the external resistance (W) for all runs in each subject over the range of W 10 +/- 1 to 137 +/- 21 J/min. Thus, at a constant tidal volume the VO2 resp was related to the mean inspiratory pressure, independent of flow or inspiratory duration. If the VO2 resp were determined mainly during inspiration, then for a given rate of external work or O2 consumption, VI would be inversely related to mean inspiratory pressure. Efficiency (E) was 2.1 +/- 0.2% and constant over a large range of VI, pressure, work rate, or resistance and was not altered by the presence of a potentially fatiguing load. The constant E over such a wide range of conditions implies a complex integration of the recruitment, mechanical function, and energy consumption of the muscles utilized in breathing.", "PMC3973684": "Starburst amacrine cells of rabbit retina have been characterized previously in terms of their highly distinctive and regular dendritic geometry. They have been identified as probable cholinergic neurons of the retina and have been shown to direct output solely to ganglion cells. The objectives of this paper are to chart the variation of starburst amacrine cells across the retina, to register the morphological features which are held constant for individual cells, and to examine factors which may remain invariant for the population with change in retinal position. Starburst amacrine cells occur as two completely segregated mirror-symmetrical populations, type a and type b cells, separately serving OFF and ON pathways, respectively. They are treated here as two distinct subpopulations with very similar features. A characteristic morphological feature of both types, related to branching pattern and best seen in flat view, is the location of boutons in the distal annular zone. This is the effective zone of synaptic output, which is constant at 50 to 60% of dendritic field area, regardless of the cell's retinal location. Both type a and type b cells exhibit systematic increase in cell body size and dendritic field diameter, and systematic decrease in frequency of branching and of synaptic boutons with perpendicular distance from the visual streak. These rates of increase or decrease fall off considerably at distances greater than about 1.5 mm dorsal and ventral to the visual streak, but at this distance, the dendritic field diameters of cells in dorsal retina are about 65% larger than the diameters of cells in ventral retina. When type a and type b cells are closely compared, they are seen to differ in several respects. Branching patterns of type a and type b cells differ slightly, the latter being more highly branched, and the normalized branching frequency histograms, characteristic for each type, remain constant with changing retinal position. At the same retinal location type a cells always have larger dendritic field diameters than type b cells. This difference is significant in ventral retina, out to a distance of at least 4.5 mm from the streak. The maximum percentage difference in size occurs not at mid-visual streak, but about 1.5 mm ventral to the streak. The population statistics of dendritic field overlap and areal dendritic coverage have been calculated using published data on cell densities. It is concluded that overlap is extraordinarily high (k greater than 25), more than 10 times that calculated for retinal ganglion cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC1540423": "A required 16 hour hospice clinical rotation was developed as part of a medical student family practice clerkship.

In order for regeneration to occur, it is believed necessary to eliminate all root surface alterations. Preparation of the root surface include scaling and root planning, use of acids and other chemical and biological agents. Citric acid has been studied by several authors, but still remains in controversy the biological nature of its effects. In spite of this, the findings of some studies indicate that citric acid used on root surfaces results in: elimination of endotoxins; chemical, exposure of dentin collagen fibers; induction of cementogenesis by the exposed dentin; demineralization of root cementum; enhancement of fibroblast attachment when a plasma factor is used in addition to citric acid demineralization and influence on direction in which the epithelium initially starts to migrate. By the other hand root surface preparation by mean of scaling and root planning is an unpredictable procedure due to variables such as failure to remove the cementum on calculus debris in a clinical situation. New research is needed in order to obtain a predictable root conditioning procedure for a biological surface.", "PMC2108896": "The mucosal-to-serosal and serosal-to-mucosal fluxes of Na+ and Cl- were measured in control mice and mice treated with heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins in the presence or absence of: Ca2(+)-ionophore A23187, an activator of Ca2(+)-calmodulin; or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C(PKC); or 1-(5-isoquinolinyl sulphonyl)-2-methyl piperazine (H-7), an inhibitor of PKC. There was net secretion of Na+ and CL- in both experimental groups in contrast to net absorption in the control group. The addition of ionophore or PMA or ionophore + PMA resulted in net secretion of Na+ and Cl- in the control group and the effect of ionophore and pMA was found to be additive. The addition of ionophore did not cause any change in electrolyte fluxes in the ST toxin treated group, however, it increased the net secretion of Na+ and Cl- in the LT toxin treated group. PMA increased the net secretion of Na+ and Cl- in the St toxin treated group, however, it did not cause any change in Na+ and Cl- fluxes in the LT toxin treated group.

We studied the efficacy and safety of butorphanol and diazepam as preprocedure medications for patients having upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. To achieve an adequate level of sedation, patients receiving diazepam required a mean (+/- SEM) dose of 12.0 +/- 1.0 mg, whereas those receiving butorphanol required a mean dose of 4.8 +/- 0.4 mg. There were no differences between treatment groups in the overall assessment of sedation, the ease of performance of the endoscopic procedure, or vital signs during or following the procedure. Fifty-four percent of butorphanol patients and 48% of diazepam patients experienced at least one minor adverse event.

Butyrate did not alter the affinity of cholera toxin binding, the dissociation constant being 0.4 nM for both control and butyrate-treated cells. Despite the increased binding, the cAMP response to cholera toxin was strongly reduced after exposure to butyrate. This reduction was dose-dependent and with butyrate 1--5 mM, intracellular and extracellular (medium) cAMP levels were decreased by more than 70% in cells incubated for 24 h with 1 nM cholera toxin. Forskolin (30 microM) elicited a cAMP response similar to that found with the toxin, and a similar inhibition of cAMP was also found after incubation of GH1 cells with butyrate. Butyrate also affected basal cAMP levels which were reduced by 40--60% in cells cultured for 24--48 h with the fatty acid. In order to study whether butyrate influenced cAMP synthesis and/or cAMP degradation, adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities were determined in control cells and in cells incubated for 24 h with cholera toxin or forskolin. Butyrate had a dual effect since, besides activating phosphodiesterase by more than twofold, it also inhibited the cyclase by 40--50% in all groups. The in vitro response of adenylyl cyclase to stimulatory (NaF) and inhibitory (carbachol and adenosine) effectors was also examined. The absolute activity of the cyclase was always 40--50% lower in the cells incubated with butyrate, but the percentage change of activity obtained in butyrate-treated and untreated cells was unaltered. In addition, ADP-ribosylation of the guanine nucleotide stimulatory component of the cyclase (Gs) was not affected in the cells incubated with butyrate. These results suggest that the catalytic (C) subunit of adenylyl cyclase and/or its interaction with the regulatory components might be altered in butyrate-treated GH1 cells. The inhibition of the cAMP response in GH1 cells was accompanied by an inhibition of a biological action of the nucleotide, namely growth hormone (somatotropin) production which is primarily controlled by thyroid hormones in these cells. Forskolin alone did not affect the somatotropin levels but potentiated the growth hormone response to triiodothyronine. Butyrate produced a dose-dependent inhibition of this response, which was totally abolished at concentrations of butyrate higher than 1 mM.", "PMC2839462": "The crucial role of leukocytes in host defense is well known.

Sequential and overlapping synthetic peptides were made to identify epitopes of TGF alpha using a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies and rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Antibodies were raised against human TGF alpha from different preparations obtained from either chemical synthesis or recombinant DNA techniques. Two related methodologies were used in these experiments. In the first method, probes were synthesized as peptides immobilized on polyethylene pins by the method of Geysen et al. (Geysen, H. M., Meloen, R. H., and Barteling, S. J. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 3998-4002). Three sets of sequentially overlapping tetrapeptides, hexapeptides, and octapeptides covering the entire length of the human TGF alpha sequence were synthesized. In the second method, a set of overlapping 8-residue synthetic peptides, freely soluble in solution, were used as probes. By both methods, the nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies, i.e. those that did not inhibit TGF alpha in mitogenic assays, recognized two immunodominant regions represented by the NH2-terminal segment (residues 1-9) and the most prominent beta-sheet of the molecule (residues 22-31). The NH2 terminus and the beta-sheet-(22-31) are in the same face of the molecule as determined by the solution structure. These two immunodominant regions were also recognized by the polyclonal antibodies as well as regions in the COOH terminus as minor epitopes. However, none of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognized any synthetic peptides. Thus, our results suggest that the receptor-binding surface of TGF alpha does not involve the face represented by the NH2-terminal fragment and the major beta-sheet of residues 22-31, but rather, that the opposite face represented by two loops formed by residues 12-20 and 34-43 may be involved in TGF alpha binding to its receptor.", "PMC3247341": "The authors evaluated the vegetative growth and alkaloid content of the Papaver somniferum L. var. album D.C. capsules cultivated in Assoro (Enna) Sicily, in relation to the geographical position, environmental conditions and soil type.

In newborns with a nuchal cord, the umbilical artery acidemia was usually mixed (68%) or respiratory (23%) in origin, and pure metabolic acidemia was infrequent (9%).

A comparison of the relative rates of metabolism of the acetyl and glycolyl amides of 2-aminofluorene showed that the former gave about twice as much of the hydroxamic acid as did the latter.

The effects of refractive indexes and sintering behaviors on transparency and strength of the aluminous porcelains consisting of high refractive germanate-glass (Na2O-TiO2-GeO2) and alumina crystal powders were examined. The various germanate-glass specimens with a high refractive index were made by fusion at about 1,300 degrees C. The refractive indexes of fused Na2O-TiO2-GeO2 glass specimens were 1.64-1.76, heightened with an increasing TiO2 content. The sintered aluminous porcelains were made from the mixed compacts consisting of 80 wt% germanate-glass and 20 wt% alumina at the densification temperature of 580-820 degrees C. Sintered aluminous porcelains prepared with high refractive germante-glass had a high transparency compared with the other aluminous porcelains, with almost the same transparency as a commercial feldspathic porcelain (body). Aluminous porcelains had lower transparency with different refractive index due to generation of crystals following the crystallization of glass matrix than that without crystallizing property.

A simple aiming task was administered to 31 normal control subjects and 29 unilateral stroke patients (14 with right hemisphere damage and 15 with left hemisphere damage). Movement amplitude was varied (25, 64 and 100 mm) and reaction time, movement time and accuracy were measured. Through a trajectory analysis, initial and corrective movements were separated. The stroke patients performed the task with their ipsilateral arm which was compared to the normal controls' right or left are performance. Regardless of the movement amplitude the left hemisphere group's reaction time was slower, and the execution of the initial movement component was less accurate than controls. No performance deficits were found on corrective movements. Performance was not impaired for the right hemisphere group on any measures. These results are discussed in terms of the hemispheres' possible roles in controlling movements which are largely open or closed loop.", "PMC3551859": "Reported are 204 primary external ureteroneocystostomies and 16 primary ureteroureterostomies in a series of 220 consecutive renal transplants. A total of 12 (5%) complications occurred; however, only seven (3%) required major operative repair, whereas five (2%) were minor and were repaired by cystoscopic or transvesical procedures. There was no mortality and no allograft loss from these complications, which tend to occur late and be amenable to prompt repair. Since the complications of external ureteroneocystostomy differ from those of the internal ureteroneocystostomy, a discussion of their treatment is provided. A review of literature shows that the external repair is growing in popularity because of its good results. The good results are attributable to the use of a short length of ureter, to the use of a continuous monofilament suture that produces an anastomosis less likely to leak, and to the need of a very small cystostomy.", "PMC3565103": "The nediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) afferents originating in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were studied in 14 dogs, using the method of retrograde horseradish peroxidase transport. Injections limited to small areas of MD indicated that projection between MD and PFC shows precise topography and reciprocity. However, the distribution of labeled neurons suggests a division of MD into two main segments related to the corresponding projection zones in the prefrontal cortex. The medioventral PFC zone is specifically related to the medial MD segment, while the dorsolateral PFC zone is related to its lateral segment. Transitional areas located on the lateral and medial surfaces were identified between the two main cortical zones. They are connected with both lateral and medial segments of MD.", "PMC3968461": "Influenza virus administered intranasally to AKR/J mice, followed 3 days later by Legionella pneumophila inoculated intranasally, caused significantly greater mortality than did either of the two agents administered alone. Viable concentrations of both bacteria and viruses dropped in sequentially infected animals, despite the ultimate fatal outcome. Viral concentrations, however, did not decrease as rapidly in sequentially infected as in singly infected mice. Histopathologic lesions were consistent with viral replication aided by elaboration of a bacterial toxin. This observation contrasts with the more commonly observed sequence in which the bacterium proliferates after the virus interferes with host defense. Cell-free preparations were found to have toxic activity.", "PMC3003853": "Rats, given a diet supplemented with 20% inositol, had threefold increased plasma inositol concentrations. The pool size of their alveolar surfactant fraction and their lamellar body fraction were the same as in the control rats and differences in phospholipid composition of the surfactant fractions were mainly restricted to changes in the percentages phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The change in phospholipid composition did not affect the pressure-volume relationship of the lungs. The labeling of phosphatidylcholine (PC), saturated phosphatidylcholine (SPC) or PI in the alveolar lavage fraction was the same for both groups, whereas labeling of alveolar PG was delayed in the inositol-fed rats. The specific activity-time relationships of the lamellar body phospholipids differed significantly between the control and inositol-fed rats and the differences in disappearance rate of the label from these fractions suggest that approximately 25-30% of the lamellar body material in inositol-fed rats is directed to a third, intracellular pool. We conclude that an increase in PI and a concomitant decrease in PG content of surfactant do not affect the clearance of alveolar surfactant, but enlarge the turnover of the lamellar body fraction because of intracellular degradation.", "PMC3529525": "alpha-Thalassemic heterozygous (Hbath/+) mice were used to investigate the possible selective advantage of transplanted normal (+/+) hemopoietic cells. Without conditioning by total-body irradiation (TBI), infusion of large numbers of normal bone marrow cells failed to correct the thalassemic peripheral blood phenotype. Since the recipients' stem cells are normal with respect to number and differentiation capacity, it was thought that the transplanted stem cells were not able to lodge, or that they were not stimulated to proliferate. Therefore, a nonlethal dose of TBI was given to temporarily reduce endogenous stem cell numbers and hemopoiesis. TBI doses of 2 or 3 Gy followed by infusion of normal bone marrow cells proved to be effective in replacing the thalassemic red cells by normal red cells, whereas a dose of 1 Gy was ineffective. It is concluded that cure of thalassemia by bone marrow transplantation does not necessarily require eradication of thalassemic stem cells. Consequently, the objectives of conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation of thalassemic patients (and possibly other nonmalignant hemopoietic disorders) should be reconsidered.", "PMC1480412": "Metabolic activity of peripheral blood granulocytes during the development of inflammatory processes in animals (rats) was studied by chemiluminescence (CL) with luminol. Intensification of the CL- response of granulocytes during an acute inflammatory process induced by intravenous or intraperitoneal zymosan injection reflected the development of mononuclear infiltrative processes. No changes occurred in CL of circulating granulocytes in oxidative injury to the lungs of rats breathing pure oxygen, which was attended by increased infiltration of polynuclear cells.", "PMC3688826": "A patient with a several year history of normal pressure hydrocephalus was found to have an infection owing to Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcal infection was not suspected until typical cells were observed in a Wright's stained smear of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A review of past medical findings in this patient showed elevated CSF values for lactic acid and protein. This case prompted us to review the use of lactic acid as an indicator of fungal meningitis and compare it to other more commonly used nonspecific indicators of fungal meningitis, notably the concentrations of glucose and protein, and the number of leukocytes in CSF. In our institution, all 10 culturally proven cases of fungal meningitis, for which the lactic acid concentration in the CSF was available, were found to have an elevated lactic acid concentration (range 3.2 to 13.3 mmol per L vs normal range 0.8 to 2.8 mmol per L). No other nonspecific indicator was elevated in all 10 patients. In view of the poor sensitivity of stained smear or wet preparations and cultures, when less than five ml of CSF are used for culture, an elevated lactic acid value in a patient with or without signs of meningitis should raise the suspicion of fungal infection.", "PMC3228557": "In this paper we examine how a large array of neurons, and their associated neural circuitry, may determine known receptive field profile types and some well-known visual phenomena including Mach bands, edge enhancement, and visual masking of one signal by another.

Investigations of nitrate and nitrite in food and human gastric cancer were performed all over the world. Literature on nitrosamines and nitrosamides is abundant, but it is impossible to make a realistic assessment of the danger of N-nitroso compounds and their precursors for man. Restriction of unnecessary intake of nitrate through drinking water and food is in any case an important task of hygiene.", "PMC4349246": "The metabolism of glucose during enterotoxin B synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus S-6 was examined under anaerobic conditions in the presence and absence of nitrate. The repression of enterotoxin synthesis which occurs during the oxidative metabolism of glucose was relieved after a shift to anaerobic conditions; glucose was then converted primarily to lactic acid and was metabolized more rapidly, presumably to obtain the equivalent amount of energy available aerobically. A greater proportion of oxidized end products and evidently more energy per glucose molecule was produced in the presence of oxygen. Thus, available energy as judged by a change in the type and proportion of end products appears to be related to the degree of toxin repression. As expected, the addition of nitrate during anaerobic glucose metabolism prevented derepression of toxin synthesis.", "PMC1933246": "Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is well known for its highly variable clinical picture, including the age at which symptoms are first detected. In order to assess the proportion of asymptomatic gene carriers at different ages, we have used linked DNA markers to study individuals at 50% genetic risk of DM, in whom neurological examination, slit-lamp examination and electromyography (EMG) had failed to show diagnostic signs. A total of 139 asymptomatic offspring of DM patients were studied. Our analyses identified 11 out of these 139 as probable gene carriers. Our data show that penetrance of the DM gene increases with age. After correction for the possibility of genetic recombination between the DM gene and the DNA markers used, we calculated the residual chance of carrying the DM gene as 8.3% for clinically normal offspring aged between 20 and 39 yrs. We evaluated several factors that might influence this figure. Neither the sex of the propositus nor that of the affected parent modified the risk of carrying the DM gene. Presence of aspecific lens opacities also did not correlate with the risk of having inherited the DM gene. Since a significant proportion of DM gene carriers are not detected by neurological examination, including slit-lamp examination and EMG, these results confirm the need for DNA analysis in asymptomatic offspring of DM patients.", "PMC2841278": "This study examined the effects of lung collapse, a condition that causes relative hypoxia in lung tissues, on superoxide dismutase (SOD), cytochrome oxidase (cyt ox), and pyruvate kinase (py ki) activities in rabbits. Cyanide-insensitive respiration measurements were done in collapsed and contralateral lungs, as an index of intracellular free radical production. Rabbits' right lungs were collapsed for 7 days after which the animals were killed. We found that control rabbit lungs contained approximately 25 SOD units/mg DNA measured with 10(-5) M KCN (total SOD) and approximately 11 SOD units/mg DNA measured with 10(-3) M KCN (mitochondrial or MnSOD). Right lung collapse caused a 25% decrease in mitochondrial SOD activity after 7 days (P less than 0.05), whereas no significant changes occurred in right or left lungs' total SOD activity. In control rabbits cyt ox activity averaged approximately 0.009 mumol ferrocytochrome c.min-1.mg DNA-1. Right lung collapse caused a greater than 40% decrease in cyt ox activity after 7 days of collapse (P less than 0.05), whereas cyt ox activity in contralateral left lungs did not change. Pyruvate kinase activity, a marker for anaerobic glycolysis resulting from tissue hypoxia, increased 49% in collapsed right lungs (P less than 0.01). Cyanide-insensitive respiration was 83% higher in 7 day-collapsed lungs (2.28 +/- 0.66 microliters O2.min-1.g-1) compared with contralateral lungs (1.24 +/- 0.34, P less than 0.05), indicating increased O2-. and H2O2 production in this tissue after homogenization at normoxic PO2 (approximately 150 Torr).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3606437": "Three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) with different symptoms at onset presented intense elementary motor perseveration before the appearance of the distinctive features of the illness.

Perseverations were observed in these patients during tests for dysdiadochokinesia, for reproduction of rhythmic structures and during the drawing of simple geometric shapes.

Anaerobic and/or micro-aerophilic bacteria were isolated from the suprapubic specimens of 11 patients (greater than 10(5) organisms/ml from 8), with identical species growing heavily from corresponding cystoscopic specimens and/or urethral swabs. Previous cystoscopies in all 11 patients and the presence of bladder tumour at the time of sampling in six were significantly and independently associated with the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from suprapubic specimens. It was concluded that transurethral instrumentation entails a definite risk of anaerobic urinary infection in addition to the recognised risk of aerobic urinary infection. The findings suggest that the antibiotics used as prophylaxis for or treatment of patients undergoing transurethral procedures should be effective against anaerobic bacteria.", "PMC3681739": "1. The properties of interneurones located in the 4th lumbar segment of the cat spinal cord (L4 interneurones) have been investigated by intracellular and extracellular recording from individual neurones. The study focused on interneurones projecting to hind-limb motor nuclei and/or interposed in pathways from group II muscle afferents. The projection to motor nuclei was assessed from antidromic activation of the neurones by stimuli applied in the motor nuclei of the 7th lumbar (L7) segment. 2. Interneurones which projected to gastrocnemius-soleus or hamstring motor nuclei were found in laminae VI and VII and at the border between laminae VII and VIII. The dominant peripheral input to most of them was from group II muscle afferents, but they were also influenced by group I muscle afferents and by afferents in cutaneous, joint and interosseous nerves. Both excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (i.p.s.p.s) were evoked from all of these fibre systems. 3. The same kind of multimodal input was also found in other interneurones in laminae VI and VII. However, their axonal projections were not identified and they might have included neurones projecting to motor nuclei (though outside the areas which were stimulated) as well as neurones with more local actions. 4. Interneurones located in laminae IV and V of the dorsal horn appeared to constitute a separate functional population since both their projections and their input differed from those of the more ventrally located interneurones; none of the dorsal horn interneurones were found to project to motor nuclei and none had input from group I afferents, although they were influenced by group II muscle afferents and by afferents in cutaneous, joint and interosseous nerves. 5. Many of the excitatory actions from group I and II afferents upon L4 interneurones were found to be evoked monosynaptically. A high proportion of L4 neurones synapsing upon motoneurones would thus be interposed in disynaptic reflex pathways from these afferents. In comparison to actions evoked via interneurones of the caudal lumbar segments, any post-synaptic potentials (p.s.p.s) evoked via L4 interneurones would be delayed. These delays would amount to 0.4-0.9 ms for p.s.p.s. from group I afferents and by 0.5-2.5 ms for group II p.s.p.s. 6. In many interneurones, particularly those located ventrally, i.p.s.p.s. were evoked by group I and II muscle afferents at latencies which indicated that they were evoked disynaptically.

Nowadays high resolution middle ear computed tomography (HR-MCT) using a special interpolation technique can demonstrate the smallest structures of the middle ear space, such as the long process of the incus and stapes. Stapes prostheses can also be seen in this way, but to identify the prothesis exactly it is necessary to determine the position of the piston hook in relation to the incus and of the piston shaft to the foot plate and scala vestibuli. Two points were of particular interest to us: HR-MCT identification of various metal and plastic pistons. Clinical significance of HR-MCT in complications following surgery. As the result of our experimental research on cadaver temporal bones, pistons must still be divided into four groups based on their demonstration by HR-MCT: Group I (e.g. Stainless Steel Cup Piston): whole piston visible. Group II (e.g. McGee Stainless Steel Piston): only piston shaft. Group III (Fisch Teflon-Platinum Piston): only hook visible. Group IV (e.g. Fisch Teflon-Wire Piston): piston hardly visible or not at all. In groups I-III it is possible to discover whether the piston is too long or too short, whether it is dislocated or has slipped. Group IV pistons, hooks from group II and the shaft from group III must be changed to allow detection by x-rays.

Flow cytofluorometry analysis demonstrated the presence of nuclear sugar-binding proteins for synthetic glycoproteins associated with different sugar residues. Among the nine neoglycoproteins used, four neoglycoproteins (namely alpha-rhamnosylated, alpha-glucosylated, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminylated and alpha-mannosylated-6P-serum albumin) strongly labelled nuclei.

The virus showed a distinct cytopathic effect characterized by an enlargement of cells and the appearance of fine granules in the cytoplasm. Porcine astrovirus was shown to have an RNA genome, as determined by the effect of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine on its replication, and five polypeptides with molecular masses of 13,000, 30,000, 31,000, 36,000, and 39,000 daltons; and it was shown to be stable to lipid solvents and heating at 50 degrees C for 30 min but somewhat labile to acid (pH 3.0). The buoyant density of the isolate determined in CsCl was 1.35 g/ml. Seroconversion to the virus was evident in the paired serum specimens obtained from pigs with diarrhea that were housed at the farm where the disease occurred. The neutralization test on serum specimens collected randomly from 128 adult pigs of eight herds revealed that 50 of the serum specimens were positive for antibody to porcine astrovirus, although there was considerable variation in the prevalence among herds, ranging from 0 to 83%.

Reduced fibrinolytic activity as assessed by the prolongation of euglobulin lysis time, decrease of t-PA and increase of PA-inhibitor and alpha 2-AP could be demonstrated. These changes did not correlate with the postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed with the 125I-fibrinogen test. However, preoperative PA-inhibitor activity was significantly higher in patients with postoperative DVT (p less than 0.01). The prophylactic treatment with aspirin (20 patients) and with heparin plus dihydroergotamine (20 patients) induced significant changes in some of those parameters. This study shows that the decrease of t-PA and the increase of PA-inhibitor may contribute to the reduced postoperative fibrinolytic activity after total hip replacement.

Mutations unique to each array, yet found in more than one subrepeat of the array, are preferentially found in adjacent and alternate subrepeats.

Electrophysiologically identified G hair and Ia muscle afferent fibers in the cuneate fasciculus were intraaxonally injected with horseradish peroxidase. Cutaneous afferents terminated dorsal to proprioceptive afferents, especially at middle levels of the cuneate nucleus. The spacing of collaterals along G hair fibers was variable, but averaged 1.46 collaterals per mm; collateral density was higher at middle cuneate levels than in the rest of the nucleus. Collateral density of Ia fibers was lower than for G hair fibers and was lowest at caudal levels of the nucleus. Branches of G hair collaterals, though often initially diverging, usually converged to terminate in a single focus in the dorsal part of the nucleus. The probability of bifurcation of Ia collaterals decreased steadily at successive branch points. These collaterals branched less symmetrically than G hair collaterals, and terminated in the ventral cuneate with less dense arbors, stretched mediolaterally, but of comparable cross-sectional area. Individual G hair collaterals gave rise to more boutons than Ia collaterals; in both cases they were mostly of the en passant type. Boutons were restricted to distal branches of G hair collaterals, whereas boutons of Ia collaterals were also located on proximal branches. Bouton size was similar for the two classes of collaterals. The data reported here, in combination with the published literature, suggest that the collaterals of roughly 300 G hair fibers overlap at any given point at middle levels of the cuneate nucleus. This high degree of anatomical convergence is not predicted by the functional segregation described with electrophysiological mapping, implying the presence of intrinsic nuclear mechanisms enhancing response specificity.", "PMC3076431": "Rhizobia are soil bacteria that can form symbiotic associations with leguminous plants leading to the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia which the plant can use. This is an interaction which involves the exchange of many signals between the plant and the bacterium. To start this interaction, rhizobia have adapted to use flavonoid compounds, released by the plant root, as part of a regulatory system to initiate the transcription of their infection (nodulation, nod) genes. The development of an assay system for the detection of plant-derived stimulatory biofactors has now led to the isolation and identification of the compounds which are responsible for the activation of the nod genes. Stimulatory compounds now have been isolated from plants: from clovers, 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone; from alfalfa, luteolin; from peas, apigenin; and from soybeans, the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. These hydroxylated flavonoid compounds are derived from the phenylpropanoid pathways which are responsible for the synthesis of many important plant phenolic compounds, including the phytoalexin molecules which are thought to be involved in plant defence systems. The current hypothesis on the regulation of the nodulation genes in Rhizobium strains is that the gene product of the regulatory nod gene, nodD, requires the presence of the plant signals to convert it to an active form. This altered NodD protein then induces the expression of the other nodulation genes. This bacterium, induced by plant biofactors, now is able to infect legume root hairs.", "PMC3028338": "Rotaviruses were isolated from Australian farm animals (calf, pig and foal) with diarrhoea.

They can be found on different locations throughout the human body, where they bind to specific receptors. By means of various agonists and antagonists it was shown that endogenous opioids possibly play a prominent role in the control of hypophyseal secretions. The menstrual cycle is thought to represent one of the most important phenomena in which these agents are involved. In the presence of a steroid-sufficient environment (that is to say, in the luteal phase) beta-endorphin exerts a tonic inhibition on the secretion of GnRH and thereby on the LH-release. Moreover, the regulation of prolactin is probably under the control of endorphins interfering via dopamine (PIF). It becomes possible to explain a number of menstrual dysfunctions in this manner. The increased plasma concentrations of beta-endorphin, which are found after physical exercise, give rise to speculations as to their involvement in the frequently appearing menstrual irregularity in women athletes. The hypothesis proposing prolactin as being entirely responsible for these phenomena is unconvincing.

In order to encourage the implementation of tobacco consumption reduction programmes, the number of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases and chief cancer localizations attributable to tobacco consumption in Spain were calculated by epidemiologic methods. Estimates suggest that, in 1983, 39.816 tobacco related deaths occurred, which accounted for 13% of total deaths reported during that year. The four tobacco related diseases producing the greatest number of deaths were ischemic cardiopathy (10.821 deaths), bronchopulmonary cancer (8.337 deaths), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.473 deaths), and acute cerebrovascular accident (6.636 deaths). These results suggest that tobacco consumption is the isolated cause responsible of the greatest number of deaths in Spain, whose control must become a priority objective in our health policy.", "PMC2151668": "Titanium is used in the field of dental implants on account of the fact that they are integrated into body tissue virtually reaction-free. This integration is made possible by the passivated layers which form within the body electrolyte, and which can be described in the terms of a semiconductive solid body. A prerequisite, however, is the prevention of relative movement between the implant and the tissue so that the passivated layer is not destroyed. The low resistance to shearing, and the oxide stoichiometry--which under in vivo conditions cannot be influenced--on repassivation following mechanical destruction strongly suggest that, during fabrication, implants should be provided with wear-resistant coatings having defined solid state properties which are similar to those of electrochemically passivated titanium surfaces. In the clinical test are already employed, a (Ti,Nb)ON- and a (Ti,Zr)O-coating on titanium and TiAl5Fe2.5. One of the most important parameters for the solid body-physical description of semiconductive hard coatings is the energy gap between conduction and valence band of the electronic structure, which are determinative for the physical-chemical behaviour of the implant surface within the body. The contribution describes the experimental procedure and the results of determinations of the energy gap at singularities in the Brillouin zone for titanium, the titanium alloys in clinical use, and some hard coatings in clinical test. The experimental method of choice for surfaces in contact with aqueous electrolytes is the electroreflectance spectroscopy.", "PMC2951345": "New users in Scotland of Possum PSU3 environmental control equipment were investigated over a 2-year period. At the conclusion of the study, of 48 disabled people, some 9 months after installation, 29 (60%) were still using the equipment, seven (15%) still had the equipment but were not using it, seven (15%) had had the equipment removed or cancelled at their request, and five (10%) had died. Of the 29 users eight (28%) were having specific operational difficulties. Analysis of a series of factors which could have influenced the outcome of the study did not reveal any one statistically significant factor affecting the success or failure of the use of the equipment for the whole sample.

This resulted in decrease of the force component of muscle contractions (more intensive in the musculus triceps brachii) without essential swing and speed of movements. The operation was performed during one day at three series: at 7 a. m. 3 p. m. and 11 p. m. During following 45 days the muscles developing various contraction force were studied: the medial head of the musculus triceps brachii and brachial muscle. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDG) activity in muscle fibers (MF) was estimated photometrically. In MF initially characterized with various SDG activity, attention was payed to its dynamics and also relation of the fibers number, possessing various level of the enzymatic activity was taken into consideration. SDG activity in MF and relation of various MF change wavy-like, fluctuating from the control meaning and returning to them again. MF with different SDG activity do not similarly react to a sharp decrease of the force loading. Fibers with high enzymatic activity react to changes of the force loading immediately, intensity of the reaction at this stage slightly depends on degree of biomechanical changes; at later stages the response is differentiated: if the loading is decreased considerably (musculus triceps brachii), the process continues developing and increasing uninterruptedly, if it decreases moderately (brachial muscle)--it stabilizes and even has tendency to adaptation and returning towards the control state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2137363": "Salmon calcitonin has been used for the management of acute hypercalcemia for the past several years. Unlike other hypocalcemic agents, it is effective within 2 hours after first dosing. This pharmacologic agent shows peak effect at 24-48 hours and has a duration of action of 4-7 days in most cases. Its effectiveness may diminish thereafter despite continuous administration (the so-called \"escape phenomenon\"). Salmon calcitonin has been shown to be effective in the management of acute hypercalcemia due to a variety of causes, and, because of its low toxicity profile, it may be administered to patients with congestive heart failure or azotemia. Salmon calcitonin is also an analgesic agent in patients with pain associated with bone metastases and may be used in conjunction with other hypocalcemic agents such as mithramycin, the bisphosphonates, or gallium nitrate to prolong the clinical response to more than 1 week. Salmon calcitonin is therefore effective and safe in the management of acute hypercalcemia.", "PMC3087858": "Amyloid lesions of bone are rare and limited almost exclusively to patients with amyloidosis secondary to plasma cell dyscrasias. The present report describes the cases of two patients receiving long-term hemodialysis (nine and 12 years) who had multiple lytic lesions of bone proved by biopsy to contain an unusual type of amyloid. Results of serum protein electrophoreses and immunoelectrophoreses, as well as bone marrow examinations, were normal. In both cases the amyloid displayed characteristic Congo red affinity and birefringence on polarized light microscopy that was inhibited by potassium permanganate treatment of sections prior to staining. Although this staining reaction was described previously exclusively in AA amyloid (i.e., the material associated with classic secondary amyloidosis), immunoperoxidase staining for AA protein in these cases was negative. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the amyloid fibrils to have unusual curvilinear configurations. Immunoperoxidase staining for beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) was positive in the amyloid lesions of both patients at the light microscopic level. Ultrastructural immunohistochemical studies for beta 2m, performed in one case, were positive. Both patients had markedly elevated serum beta 2m levels. By Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, purified beta 2m demonstrated partial identity with purified amyloid protein fractions and a serum constituent. Bone lesions composed of amyloid related to beta 2M probably represent a new subgroup of amyloid disease that may be linked to renal failure and long-term hemodialysis.", "PMC2626249": "Identification of the determinants of patient symptoms is a requisite for successful patient management in contact lens practice. Symptoms reported by 104 patients wearing hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) contact lenses, who presented consecutively to a large contact lens clinic, were analyzed. Dryness was reported more frequently than the symptoms scratchy and watery (p less than 0.001). Females using oral contraceptives were more likely to experience the symptoms of scratchiness (p less than 0.01) and dryness (p less than 0.05) than females who were not using oral contraceptives. The symptoms dryness was reported more frequently by patients whose lenses were older than 6 months (p less than 0.05), and those wearing toric lenses (p less than 0.01).

More detailed information was obtained by immuno-electron microscopy using the same fixation technique and Protein A-coated gold particles for labeling.

Electrophysiologic monitoring techniques are helpful in predicting hemispheric ischemia.", "PMC2364640": "Non-uniform composition of gas in the lungs may arise because of uneven dilution of alveolar with inspired gas by convection (bulk flow) or because of the finite rates of molecular diffusion in the small air-spaces. Such non-uniformity represents 'mixing inefficiency' which may be expressed by the difference between the effective dead-space ('ventilatory dead-space', VDV) and the actual airway dead-space ('Fowler dead-space', VDF). This expression of mixing inefficiency does not distinguish between convective and diffusive mechanisms. We show, from simulated gas wash-out of an asymmetrical, two-compartment model of the lung, that a third dead-space ('wash-out dead-space', VDW) enables this distinction to be made: VDV-VDW reveals convective, and VDW-VDF diffusive, mixing inefficiency. The position of the branch point subtending the two compartments greatly affects the outcome, however. When the branch point is relatively peripheral, inefficiency is mainly diffusive; when it is relatively central, inefficiency is mainly convective. These findings indicate how mixing efficiency may be measured more selectively than at present in real lungs.", "PMC3772477": "Eight patients with recurrent meningiomas (four malignant, two hemangiopericytic, and two nonmalignant) were given intravenous bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), 200 mg/sq m, at the time of surgery to label cells in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis phase; labeled cells were detected in excised tumor specimens by immunoperoxidase staining using anti-BUdR monoclonal antibody. These tumors showed a wide range of BUdR labeling indices (LI's), calculated as the percentage of BUdR-labeled cells divided by the total number of cells scored, from 0.3% to 5.4%. The tumor doubling times (Td's), estimated from serial computerized tomography scans, ranged from 8 to 440 days and showed a close inverse correlation with the BUdR LI's. A semilogarithmic linear regression analysis of these values yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Tumor doubling time (Td) can be estimated using the formula: Td = 500 X Exp (-0.73 X LI), where Exp signifies the natural log base. By predicting the growth rate of meningiomas, the BUdR LI may supplement histopathological diagnosis and improve both the determination of prognosis and the design of treatment modalities in individual patients.", "PMC3588836": "The effect of ferrous ion-ascorbate and X-radiation on multilamellar liposomes, composed of either completely saturated, unsaturated or a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, is reported. Lipid composition is shown to be of critical importance in determining the extent to which peroxidation occurs. Liposomes composed of the mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are peroxidized to a lesser extent by ferrous ion-ascorbate. The reduced peroxidation is apparently the result of an inhibition mechanism shown by the saturated lipid component. In contrast, liposomes composed of mixed lipids do not reduce the level of peroxidation induced by ionizing radiation. These results show that the composition of liposomes plays a role in determining the extent to which peroxidation occurs when a chemical oxidant is employed, but composition is a negligible factor when ionizing radiation is the oxidant.", "PMC3806276": "Detection probabilities for wavelength changes were measured as functions of stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) with the chromatic double-pulse method. Two test stimuli of a wavelength lambda t were successively exchanged with a reference stimulus of a wavelength lambda r in equal luminance for a short duration with a SOA. Durations were 5 and 50 msec, and the SOA varied between 5 or 50 and 2000 msec. Lambda r's were 571 and 518 nm, chosen from wavelengths near unique yellow and unique green so that wavelength difference delta lambda = lambda t - lambda r was perceived mainly as redness and greeness for lambda r = 571 nm and yellowness and blueness for lambda r = 518 nm. The results showed that temporal integration characteristics for these equal-luminance wavelength changes were quite consistent: complete integration with SOA up to 20 msec, partial integration with SOA between 20 and 200 msec, and probability integration with SOA greater than 200 msec. They did not show any inhibitory integration that was found for luminance changes.", "PMC3588933": "The vagus nerve, as a result of its protracted course from the brain stem to the abdomen, can present a difficult imaging problem when it is compromised by a clinically occult lesion. The clinical and radiologic records of 48 patients with suspected vagus nerve dysfunction were reviewed to derive an efficient and effective approach to imaging this patient population. An imaging algorithm is proposed in which vagal neuropathies are divided both clinically and radiologically into proximal and distal categories. Proximal vagal lesions are part of a cranial neuropathy complex and have associated oropharyngeal signs and symptoms (e.g., abnormal gag reflex, uvular deviation). Distal vagal lesions occur as an isolated paralysis of the vagus nerve with no symptoms or signs referable to the oropharynx. Either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to diagnose proximal or distal lesions. However, CT will be insensitive in the detection of the more cephalic proximal lesions, especially those in the brain stem, basal cisterns, and skull base.", "PMC3772478": "In a review of 38 glioblastoma patients for whom fresh tissue kinetic data were available before any therapy was instituted, no correlation between the labeling index and survival time could be statistically determined.

Bilateral posterior tibial nerve stimulation was used in 181 cases and unilateral median nerve stimulation in 39. Spinal cord (interspinous ligament needles), subcortical (neck surface), and cortical (scalp surface) SEP's were monitored. Seven patients had worsening of neurological function after surgery, three of whom demonstrated significant changes in SEP's monitored. In an additional four cases, there was more than a 50% decrease in amplitude of subcortical/cortical SEP's during monitoring, but no change in neurological status postoperatively. Combined monitoring of spinal cord, subcortical, and cortical SEP's enhanced the certainty of detecting spinal cord dysfunction even though there was a significant number of false-negative and false-positive results. A marked change in the SEP's indicated a high chance of developing a neurological deficit (three or 43% of seven cases), and if there was no change the chance of any neurological postoperative deficit was extremely low (four or 1.87% of 213 cases). These data justify the use of intraoperative SEP monitoring.", "PMC2785871": "A micromethod adapted for automated determinations was used to measure basal plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine [H(e)]. These levels included the sum of free and bound forms of homocysteine, its disulfide oxidation product, homocystine, and the homocysteine-cysteine-mixed disulfide. Two groups of subjects were studied: apparently healthy individuals (n = 103) and patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) (n = 47). Because age in PAOD patients was higher than in control subjects, the control subjects were subdivided into younger and older groups (aged 60 years or less and more than 60 years, respectively). The H(e) levels in the younger groups were 11.18 +/- 3.58 (mean +/- SD, expressed as homocysteine) and 8.58 +/- 2.82 nmol/ml in men and women, respectively; in the older groups, the levels were 10.74 +/- 2.16 and 9.04 +/- 2.16 nmol/ml in men and women, respectively. There was a positive correlation of H(e) levels with age in the younger control women (r = 0.373; p less than 0.02); no significant correlations were present in the other three control groups. Levels of H(e) in PAOD patients (15.44 +/- 5.76 and 17.04 +/- 8.26 nmol/ml in men and women, respectively) were significantly higher than those indicated above in the older controls. Next, the PAOD patients were assigned to two subgroups: 1) those with normal levels of H(e) (within two standard deviations of the mean of the control values) and 2) those with elevated levels of H(e). Age, cholesterolemia, and the prevalence of smoking and diabetes were similar in both subgroups. These results suggest that elevated plasma H(e) is an independent risk factor for arterial occlusive disease.", "PMC4066768": "Myoblasts from primary rat cultures and established mouse (Cl10) and rat (L6, Ama 420) cell lines were examined for c-oncogene expression during exponential growth and under conditions which allowed myogenic differentiation. The abundance of c-Ki-ras transcripts in mRNA from confluent, quiescent cultures was reduced to 15-40% of that in mRNA from exponentially growing cells. This reduction was found both in primary myoblast cultures, myoblast lines that formed myotubes (L6 and Cl10) and in a differentiation defective subline (Ama 420). The level of c-myc transcripts was lowered when myogenic rat L6 myoblasts reached a high cell density, stopped DNA synthesis and formed myotubes. At the same cell density, growth arrested myoblasts of differentiation defective Ama 420 cells maintained a high level of c-myc expression. This shows that DNA replication and c-myc expression are independently regulated. All myoblast lines also showed expression of c-abl during exponential growth phase. Reduced expression was seen in differentiated L6 and Cl10 cultures. No expression was detected when mRNA from multiplying and differentiating myoblasts cultures were probed for c-myb, c-erbA, c-erbB, c-mos, c-fes, and c-src. The observations are consistent with a role for c-Ki-ras in myoblast proliferation and suggest that a reduction in c-myc expression may be a necessary prerequisite for terminal myogenic differentiation.", "PMC2225600": "It is possible to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse by suppressing ovulation, inhibiting fertilization or interfering with tubal transport and/or implantation of the early embryo. IUCDs probably prevent implantation by stimulating the release of prostaglandins from the endometrium but are not acceptable to many women. Post-coital contraceptive steroids, e.g. high-dose oestrogens, are associated with a relatively high incidence of side-effects and must be taken within 72 hours of coitus. As these agents are effective by creating a uterine environment unfavourable for implantation, it may be possible to use antigestagens or antioestrogens in this way. It is already known that an antigestagen in combination with a prostaglandin is a highly effective method of inducing abortion in very early pregnancy. The corpus luteum is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and its destruction by a luteolytic agent should dislodge the implanting embryo. If an effective method of preventing implantation could be developed which was relatively free from side-effects, it should be possible to use it as a regular form of contraception to be taken only when the risk of pregnancy had occurred.", "PMC3560952": "Women college students (N = 66) viewed videotapes of a soap opera episode and a rock music program, ostensibly to evaluate the appeal of such material to college women. Different versions of the videotape included zero, three or nine wine commercials. Refreshments, including white wine, were available to the subjects. Suspiciousness about the experiment was evaluated through an open-ended questionnaire, responses to which were independently content-analyzed by two scorers. Major findings were as follows: Women exposed to nine wine commercials consumed more wine than those exposed to three. Twelve women were judged suspicious about the experiment, but none showed continued specific awareness of the study's true purpose. The differential consumption patterns of women in the three-wine-commercial and nine-wine-commercial conditions were exaggerated among suspicious women. These findings, in light of previous observations, suggest opposite reactions to soft-sell versus hard-sell persuasive appeals by men and women, notably ones predisposed to be suspicious about the purpose of experiments.", "PMC3120530": "Acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of CNS inflammatory and demyelinating disease, was produced in guinea pigs and imaged with MR. Correlation of histopathology with MR revealed acute mononuclear perivascular inflammatory changes and edema corresponding to the high-intensity abnormalities observed on long repetition time (TR) images. Our results suggest that in acute multiple sclerosis the high intensity noted on long TR images may be secondary to associated inflammatory changes rather than to demyelination.", "PMC2882427": "The application of tetanic electrical stimuli to the stratum radiatum fibre pathway in the hippocampus in vitro produces an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-dependent enhancement of synaptic efficacy. Repeated application of such stimuli produces a progressive enhancement of synaptic efficacy leading to the genesis of spontaneous and stimulation-evoked epileptiform discharges. We have used this in vitro approach to explore the cellular mechanisms which underlie the kindling model of epilepsy. Kindling of the stratum radiatum fibre pathway in vitro induced a progressive, long-lasting reduction of both spontaneous and stimulation-evoked GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps). The reduction of i.p.s.ps by kindling was associated with a profound decrease in the sensitivity of CA1 pyramidal neurons to ionophoretically applied GABA and an increase in sensitivity to NMDA. The reduction of i.p.s.ps and GABA sensitivity was prevented by kindling in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV). These results demonstrate that kindling-like stimulus patterns produce a reduction of GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus resulting from a stimulus-induced postsynaptic activation of NMDA receptors. The modulation of GABAergic inhibition by NMDA receptors may cause the synaptic plasticity which underlies the kindling model of epilepsy.", "PMC3018166": "Using ligand binding techniques, we studied alpha-adrenergic receptors in brains obtained at autopsy from seven histologically normal controls and seven patients with histopathologically verified Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD). Binding of the alpha-adrenergic antagonists [3H]prazosin and [3H]yohimbine to membranes of human brains exhibited characteristics compatible with alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, respectively. Binding of both ligands was saturable and reversible, with dissociation constants of 0.15 nM for [3H]prazosin and 5.5 nM for [3H]yohimbine. [3H]Prazosin binding was highest in the hippocampus and frontal cortex and lowest in the caudate and putamen in the control brains. [3H]Yohimbine binding was highest in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) and frontal cortex and lowest in the caudate and cerebellar hemisphere in the control brains. Compared with values for the controls, [3H]prazosin binding sites were significantly reduced in number in the hippocampus and cerebellar hemisphere, and [3H]yohimbine binding sites were significantly reduced in number in the NbM in the ATD brains. These results suggest that alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are present in the human brain and that there are significant changes in numbers of both receptors in selected regions in patients with ATD.", "PMC2233748": "Opioid peptides are expressed in the reproductive system and have been reported to regulate reproductive function. The present study used in situ hybridization to selectively localize ovarian cells containing high levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA, an opioid precursor, during different stages of ovarian development. Prepubertal rats were primed with PMSG to stimulate follicular development, followed by hCG to induce ovulation. Treatment groups consisted of control (no treatment), PMSG (2 days post-PMSG), 1 day corpus luteum (CL; 1 day post-hCG), and 8 day CL (8 days post-hCG). POMC mRNA-containing cells were present in antral follicles, CL, and the interstitial compartment. With gonadotropin treatment, the percentage of follicles containing heavily labeled cells increased in the PMSG and 1 day CL groups. The number of POMC mRNA-containing cells per follicle also increased in the 1 day CL group. In the CL, no difference was observed in the percentage of CL exhibiting labeled cells between the 1 day CL and 8 day CL groups; however, more labeled luteal cells per CL were present in the 1 day CL group. A marked increase in POMC mRNA-containing cells was observed in the interstitial compartment of the 1 day CL group. These results indicate that the number of POMC mRNA-containing cells increases with follicular development and CL formation; however, the ovarian distribution suggests that the labeled cells could be nonendocrine cells, possibly white blood cells. The in situ hybridization findings are indicative of low total concentrations of ovarian POMC mRNA, suggesting mainly an autocrine or paracrine role for POMC or POMC-derived peptides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2816216": "Seventy-eight patients were included in a prospective study of the cardiac risk in abdominal aortic surgery.

Thirty-three patients developed some kind of cardiac event, 13 of which were myocardial infarctions leading to death in six patients. Computer aided stepwise logistic procedure was used to determine risk factors independently correlated with these complications. This study showed that the Goldman risk score, angina, hypertension and renal insufficiency were significantly correlated with postoperative cardiac complications while no correlations were demonstrated with history of myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure or the ASA score system. A high incidence of cardiac complications (32%) was also found in the low-risk category in the Goldman score system, which indicates the need for cardiac function tests before abdominal aortic surgery.", "PMC2850370": "Soluble extracts of Escherichia coli capable of carrying out replication of the mini-RK2 derivative pCT461 have been prepared from cells carrying this plasmid or from plasmid-free bacteria. The latter are dependent upon exogenously added plasmid-encoded replication protein (TrfA) and require additional DnaA protein for optimum activity. This dependence upon DnaA was confirmed by the failure of DnaA-deficient cell extracts to support replication of pCT461 in the absence of added DnaA protein. Replication is unidirectional and begins at or near oriV, the vegetative replication origin of RK2. DNase I protection studies with purified TrfA indicate that this protein acts by binding to short (17 base-pairs) directly repeated DNA sequences present in oriV. The in vitro replication is resistant to rifampicin but can be abolished by antibodies against DnaG protein (E. coli primase) or DnaB protein (helicase) and by DNA gyrase inhibitors. Inhibition by arabinosyl-CTP suggests that DNA polymerase III is responsible for elongation of nascent DNA strands. These results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of RK2 replication and in the context of the host range of the plasmid.", "PMC3467058": "Healing of specific rat periodontal ligament (PDL) sites following freezing injury was monitored histologically to evaluate repair potentials of this tissue. Buccal alveolar plates supporting the first mandibular molar in 15 adult rats were surgically exposed. The coronal 3 mm of plate covering the buccal surface of the mesiobuccal root and underlying periodontal ligament and cementum were subjected to ultralow temperature using a gas expansion micro/cryoprobe, diameter 2 mm, cooled to -81 degrees C for 5 seconds. Tissues were repositioned and sutured in layers. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 24 and 72 hours and at 2, 5 and 7 weeks following surgery and mandibles removed for histologic analysis. Microscopic evaluation of 24-hour specimens showed loss of cellular vitality in the PDL, adjacent bone and cementum at experimental sites. Cellularity of the gingiva coronal to the crest, and of the PDL apical to the experimental zone, appeared to be within normal limits. Transition between experimental and nonexperimental sites was abrupt. After 72 hours cells from the PDL and gingiva appeared to migrate into and repopulate the noncellular PDL. Few capillaries surrounded by mesenchymal cells and limited polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration were observed within the injured PDL site. Marginal gingival inflammation was minimal. At 14 days, collagen lysis, resorption of alveolar bone and root resorption were evident. In the PDL space, nonfunctionally oriented, cellular connective tissue elements were abundant. At 5 and 7 weeks, root resorption was marked.

Experiments to elucidate the mechanism of this effect involved comparisons with a low-molecular-weight sodium polyacrylate (EN5), either drug being given to groups of 5-8 rats, male or female, in doses of 5-100 mg/kg i.v., i.p. or s.c., or up to 1000 mg/kg p.o. Effects were observed visually up to the death of the animals, and these plus survivors killed after 10 h were prosected for macroscopic and histopathological examination of internal organs. Characteristic EN21 effects were only observed in animals treated by the i.p. and i.v. routes, death occurring in 4-10 h or rapidly (1 h) after i.v. dosage. No such effects were observed from EN5 by any dose or route. There were no differences between effects in male and female animals. In rats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone and cannulated for blood pressure recording (arterial and venous), no hypertensive effects were observed to explain haemorrhagic effects. Instead, i.v. and i.p. injections gave depressor effects, insidious in the latter case, with a precipitous fall only in the delayed terminal stage. Effects were accompanied by cardiac arrhythmias. Depressor effects were prevented by prior treatment of the animals with calcium chloride solution.

Low levels of perceived family conflict and control served as life stress buffers in the prediction of distress, whereas a high level of perceived independence served as a life stress exacerbator. These interaction effects differ from those obtained for a normal sample of adolescents in the lone previous study (Burt, Cohen, & Bjorck, 1988) that reported comparable analyses.

The ORA group contained approximately equal numbers of men and women, were less rheumatoid factor positive, had a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lower HLA-DR4 positivity, and a tendency towards larger joint involvement at the onset of the disease. These features have been reported by many authors except for the lower DR4 positivity. Of these features, the lower prevalence of rheumatoid factor positivity and the tendency towards larger joint involvement at the onset were characteristic of a subset of patients with ORA who had had osteoarthritis before the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. It is suggested that osteoarthritic large joints may be susceptible to the occurrence of rheumatoid synovitis at the onset of the disease, but that the osteoarthritis inducing factor may be negatively related to the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.", "PMC2798719": "The paper presented here is a contribution to the debate on the methodological dualism of hermeneutical and nomothetical procedures in psychotherapy and psychotherapeutic research.

Rather than precipitately mediating between clinical hermeneutics and empirical nomology, a critical differentiation of both methodologies is advocated.

Accordingly, the excessive recurrence of one base oligomer entails the noticeable underrepresentation by the other, so that if the former is the same in most, if not all, of the coding sequences, the latter too must necessarily be the same in all. Indeed, a previous series of studies on 20-odd divergent coding sequences established CTG as one of the most frequently recurring base trimers (if not the most frequent), and this excess was compensated by the underrepresentation by CG and TA dimer-containing base trimers. In this study, I have analyzed three additional coding sequences and reanalyzed one previously studied coding sequence. These four, derived from man, a plant, and a fish, were of variously lopsided base compositions that were not at all conducive to high recurrences of either CT dimer or CT and TG. Yet, the excess of CT and TG dimers accompanied by complementary deficiency of CG and TA dimers emerged as the common rule. Thus, I propose the above as the universal rule of coding sequence construction. The underrepresentation by CG and TA dimers within coding sequences explains why regulatory signals in intergenic spacers are of two kinds: one, TA dimer rich; and the other, CG dimer rich.", "PMC2694357": "Studies of the effects of chemical potential, temperature, and metabolic perturbation on static ion contents, kinetics of the approach to equilibrium, and kinetics of ionic self-exchange in human lymphocytes are reviewed. The results contradict the classical concept of cell ion and water physiology, the membrane-osmotic, pump-leak theory, and are re-interpreted by an adsorption model of the cell. In this model, most of cell water exists in a physical state sufficiently ordered to reduce the partition function of dissolved ions, and most of cell potassium is associated with fixed charges on macromolecules. Competing adsorption of potassium and sodium is cooperative and has a critical temperature dependence. The kinetics of the approach to equilibrium are described by a time dependent Ising model. High rates of isotopic self-exchanges of potassium and sodium near the transition point are postulated to result from an increased rate of fluctuations within the ensemble of ion-adsorbing proteins.", "PMC3493551": "The effect of single, sublethal i.p. injection of dieldrin on the primary antibody response to thymodependent (sheep red blood cells, SRBC) and T-cell-independent (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) antigens were investigated in inbred C57Bl/6 mice. Time-course studies showed significant suppression of the anti-SRBC IgM and anti-LPS IgM response at 7-24 days and at 4-14 days, respectively, after exposure to 0.6 LD50 of dieldrin. The anti-SRBC IgG response was also suppressed by dieldrin exposure, however, maximal suppressory effect was found at 48 days after the pesticide exposure. Similar patterns of the dieldrin-induced suppression of the primary IgM response to the thymodependent and T-cell-independent antigens, in addition to the overall control of cytotoxicity of lymphoid cell populations, suggest rather dysfunction of cellular cooperation during the inductory phase of the immune humoral response.", "PMC3531394": "Klebocin, a bacteriocin produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae 158, was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate fractionation and sequential DEAE-Sephacel and Sephadex G-150 column chromatography.

As determined by light microscopy as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy, mucosal architecture involving classic ultrastructure of chicken cecal mucosa was preserved. Protein content of cecal explants did not change up to 48 h of culture. DNA content of cecal explants did not change up to 24 h of culture but decreased significantly to two-thirds of control in 48 h of culture. Based on the morphologic and physiologic findings, it became evident that this organ culture system using Trowell T8 medium at 25 degrees C can be successfully used as an in vitro experimental model for as long as 24 h. The organ culture system could be a useful tool, from the structural integrity of ceca observed in this study, in investigating mucosal function and mucosal response to drugs, carcinogens, trophic factors, and pathogens.", "PMC2291354": "Within 21 years, 18 patients with acute small bowel hemorrhage were treated.

The patients with established cerebral infarctions of more than 7 days duration and the patients with intracerebral hematomas had no response to intravenous naloxone. Of 20 patients with acute cerebral ischemia of less than 24 hours duration, 7 had prompt, complete and long-lasting recovery. These patients had no subsequent evidence of cerebral infarct by C.T. scanner 48 hours after the onset of the cerebral ischemia and were asymptomatic when discharged. The 3 patients with hyperacute cerebral ischemia secondary to cerebral angiography had a dramatic response to the injection of naloxone. These findings suggest that intravenous naloxone may differentiate reversible versus irreversible cerebral ischemia.", "PMC2226049": "A comprehensive analysis is reported in 376 healthy middle and old-age persons, including measurements of bone mineral content (BMC) of the mid-radias, pituitary sex hormones (RIA), serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, urinary calcium, phosphate, hydroxyproline (BCA), daily intake of protein and calcium, physical exercise and activity, body weight, amenorrhea etc. Results showed that the preponderance of bone resorption over bone formation is the essential pathophysiological change of involutional osteoporosis. For females, bone loss is regulated mainly by estrogen in presenile group, co-regulated by estrogen and androgen in senile group. For males, urinary hydroxyproline excretion is also regulated by estrogen A remarkable correlation was observed between BMC and the following factors: serum calcium, urinary calcium, hydroxyproline, body weight, physical exercise, amenorrhea, intake of protein and calcium. Our data indicated that the intake of calcium daily in old chinese should not be lower than 700 mg (male) and 900 mg (female), protein should not be lower than 60-70 g.

Four-week banding increased left ventricular dry weight-to-body weight ratio to 158 +/- 8% of that of sham-operated controls. In isolated nonworking hearts perfused with crystalloid solution, peak mean coronary flow rate (CFR) was measured after brief ischemia. CFR and CFR/dry tissue weight significantly decreased (75 +/- 5 and 54 +/- 3% of that of controls at 100 mmHg of coronary perfusion pressure; 75 +/- 5 and 54 +/- 4% at 150 mmHg, respectively). Four weeks after debanding was performed, CFR and CFR/dry tissue weight increased to similar levels in controls. On the other hand, 10-wk banding produced the same degree of myocardial hypertrophy and decreases in CFR and CFR/dry tissue weight as in 4-wk banded rats. Four weeks after debanding was performed, CFR had not changed. CFR/dry tissue weight increased because of regression of myocardial hypertrophy but was significantly lower than that in rats debanded after 4 wk of banding. Thus the duration of pressure overload does not affect the degree of coronary circulation abnormalities in the progression process but does affect it in the regression process.", "PMC3283713": "Body weight can be viewed as a physiologic variable that, like core temperature, is regulated at a specified level or set point. Adjustments in both food intake and energy expenditure are used to stabilize weight at the set-point level. Animal studies indicate that some forms of obesity can be regarded as instances of regulation at an elevated set point, while other forms seemingly result from a regulatory dysfunction. Possibly, a similar distinction between regulated and unregulated forms of obesity can be made in humans. Traditional weight-loss programs may be effective in treating unregulated forms. However, if obesity is the consequence of regulation at a high set point, a metabolic resistance to weight change will be encountered and weight loss will be difficult to achieve or maintain. Help for such patients will await development of safe and effective methods for altering the set point.", "PMC3008675": "The dopaminergic and alpha adrenergic activities of TL-99 were investigated using in vitro preparations including cat right atria, guinea-pig atria, rat vas deferens and rabbit aortic strip. TL-99 was found to be as potent as clonidine as a stimulant of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors of noradrenaline nerve endings in guinea-pig atria and rat vas deferens. In the cat right atria, TL-99 preferently stimulates presynaptic dopamine receptors. The involvement of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation in TL-99-induced inhibition of tachycardic response to transmural stimulation in cat right atria is not clear. TL-99 is one thousand times less active as a stimulant of alpha-1 adrenoceptors of rabbit aorta than as a stimulant of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors of guinea-pig atria and rat deferens. Data from this manuscript as well as reports in the literature strongly suggest that TL-99 may interact with both alpha 2-adrenoceptors as well as dopamine receptors. The selectivity for receptor-type depends on test conditions, species variations and organ selectivity. The significance of these findings with TL-99 is discussed.", "PMC3525656": "It is difficult to recognize tendon pathology in the ankle area when there is no open wound. This manuscript was written to indicate subtle characteristics associated with tendon trauma around the ankle. Failure to recognize these problems will result in improper treatment or lack of treatment and the results may be disastrous to the patient.

Forty Escherichia and eight Klebsiella cysteine-requiring strains were used to test the ease with which various test systems identified clinical isolates of cysteine auxotrophs. In a preliminary experiment, the growth yield of 10 cysteine-requiring E. coli in 10 solutions of commercially available peptones was in each instance less than that of prototrophic control and showed that these sources of nutrients were suboptimal for these strains. A significant proportion of the cysteine-requiring strains were not adequately identified by growth-dependent tests which used various peptones as a nutrient source. Problems were encountered with all test systems examined, which were as follows: conventional methods; the API 20E, Microbact, and Vitek systems; and two rapid methods for the identification of E. coli, the Rapidec coli and the beta-D-glucuronidase tests. The performance of the test systems was only partly improved when inocula were derived from appropriately supplemented media.

The pi values have been monitored by the Wilhelmy plate technique. The Ps values have been measured with a surface viscoelastometer. The changes of pi with time for BSA and BSA-DS complexes in general takes place in two stages which can be attributed to two corresponding limiting factors: diffusion of molecules (or particles) to the interface, and rearrangements of adsorbed molecules. The diffusion-controlled stage for the BSA-DS complexes was found to be several times as long as for BSA. The relaxation time of the second stage is a function of protein concentration Cp, for the complexes having maximum value at Cp = 10(-3)-10(-2) g/l. These maxima are coincident with midpoints of the surface pressure isotherms. The latter one of the BSA-DS complexes is shifted towards greater protein concentrations in comparison with that of BSA. The Ps assumes maximum values at Cp corresponding to the midpoints of surface pressure isotherms. These values for the complexes are 15-20 times greater the that for free BSA.", "PMC3365241": "Vasopressin stimulates phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis in REF52 cells, and this phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis results in increases in choline containing metabolites in the culture medium (2.3 x control levels) and accumulation of cellular diacylglycerol (6.5 x control levels). Vasopressin is the only component of a 6-component mixture of the serum-free medium for REF52 cells that induces the phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis response. The effect of vasopressin is both time- and concentration-dependent. Maximal levels of both phosphatidyl-choline hydrolysis and accumulation of diacylglycerol are observed between 10 and 20 min after treatment with vasopressin. Effects are maximal at vasopressin concentrations of 100 ng/ml; the ED50 for vasopressin-stimulated phosphatidyl-choline hydrolysis is approximately 0.7 ng/ml. The evolution of diacylglycerol occurs in a time frame that is consistent with the diacylglycerol activating protein kinase C in a \"second phase\" agonist response.", "PMC2148204": "The aims of this study were two-fold. Firstly, to characterize the behavioral properties of a potential new dopamine D1 receptor agonist, (-)-4,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydro-7-methyl-indolo[4,3-ab]phenanth ridine (CY 208-243), to determine its suitability as a tool for investigating D1 receptor function in vivo. Secondly, to investigate how the behavioural properties of D1 agonists are modified in the presence of D2 receptor blocking drugs. For this purpose, using mice, we employed CY 208-243 and 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SKF 38393) as reference D1 agonists, and the substituted benzamides metoclopramide and sulpiride as selective D2 antagonists. CY 208-243 (0.25-10 mg/kg) caused only a modest increase in grooming in non-habituated mice, but stimulated locomotion, rearing, grooming and orofacial activities in habituated animals. These responses were inhibited by a D1 antagonist, but not by D2 antagonists, suggesting CY 208-243 behaves as a selective agonist of D1 receptors in vivo. In non-habituated mice, doses of metoclopramide and sulpiride which had little or no effect on motor behaviour by themselves, interacted synergistically with CY 208-243 (4 mg/kg) and SKF 38393 (30 mg/kg) to cause extended periods of immobility. Other species-typical behaviours were not affected in this way. For example, grooming was decreased by metoclopramide and increased by sulpiride, indicating that an increase in behavioural competition from this parameter was not the cause of the hypokinesia. To explain the apparent ability of D1 receptor stimulation to increase exploratory activity in earlier experiments and to decrease it here, it is proposed that this behaviour is regulated by D1 receptors coupled to two functionally opposite postsynaptic D2 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3344605": "The costs of anaesthetic drugs, intravenous agents as well as gases, were studied for different anaesthetic techniques in a medium-sized operative procedure, cholecystectomy.

Anaesthesia without volatile inhalation agents used with a low-flow technique was the least expensive, and anaesthesia with isoflurane in a non-rebreathing system was the most expensive.

Major constituents of this fiber include a family (the sp-I family) of high Mr (1 X 10(6) secretory polypeptides. Because of our interest in the polypeptide composition and polymerization of the salivary fiber we conducted a survey of the electrophoretic pattern of sp-I components found in salivary glands obtained from individual larvae. The survey encompassed ten strains of Chironomus tentans, three strains of Chironomus pallidivittatus and four strains of Chironomus thummi. Salivary glands from C. tentans and C. pallidivittatus contained at least four sp-I components (sp-Ia, sp-Ib, sp-Ic and sp-Id) that behave identically with regard to their electrophoretic mobility and detectability when larvae were exposed to galactose or glycerol. Sp-I components in C. thummi were generally fewer and not directly comparable by electrophoretic mobility to sp-I components in the other two species. During this survey two important alterations were observed in the electrophoretic pattern of sp-I components obtained from C. tentans and C. pallidivittatus. First, all four sp-I components exhibited, with a low frequency, double bands that appeared as slow-versus-fast electrophoretic variants of a particular component. Secondly, the relative steady-state level of each sp-I component fluctuated in comparison to other sp-I components in the same extract. This fluctuation varied such that any one sp-I component might appear as a single prominent component.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3689661": "The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of dietary vitamin A and E supplementation on tumorigenesis in correlation to the fat content of the respective diet in an animal model.

The results suggest that the proP-mediated transport of L-proline (in addition to that by proU) is important in osmoregulation. proP::lac operon fusions were used to demonstrate that this gene shows limited induction of expression upon growth in media having elevated osmolarity and that it is transcribed clockwise on the chromosome.", "PMC3116186": "Ultrasonic instruments used in dentistry generally operate at frequencies of 25 to 42 kHz. A wire oscillating at these ultrasonic frequencies immersed in a liquid produces local flow patterns termed acoustic microstreaming. Large shear forces are produced which are able to rupture erythrocytes and platelets both in vitro and in vivo. This results in activation of the blood coagulation system with subsequent thrombus formation. The probe tip of an ultrasonic scaler was positioned to touch a mammalian mesenteric artery. The probe was operated for 10 to 20 s at a displacement amplitude of 15 micron. Acoustic microstreaming occurred which disturbed blood flow and this microstreaming ceased when the power was switched off. After continued operation of the probe, thrombi were formed against the vessel wall with fragments embolising downstream. These thrombi eventually grew to occlude the vessel. Furthermore, an in situ model demonstrated that acoustic energy was transmitted through the tooth during typical ultrasonic scaling procedures. As a consequence of these observations, it is possible that acoustic microstreaming fields may be generated within the blood vessels entering the tooth apex which are large enough to induce platelet damage. Therefore there is a potential hazard from the use of the ultrasonic scaler which may induce similar thrombi formation within the pulpal or perapical tissues of the teeth. If this were to occur it could result in tooth death which might not become evident until a long time after the ultrasonic exposure.", "PMC1613255": "Detection of cytokine-producing cells can be accomplished by reverse modifications of the ELISPOT assay using cytokine-specific unconjugated and enzyme-labelled antibodies as solid phase capture system and detecting reagents, respectively. However, in certain situations where the secreted cytokine is produced in minute amounts such as in the case of interleukin-1 (IL-1), the sensitivity of the indicator immunoenzyme system employed may be insufficient to permit detection of the corresponding secreting cells. We have developed a novel immunoenzyme amplification procedure that involves the use of a biotinylated secondary anti-enzyme antibody reagent to enhance the signal provided by the primary enzyme-labelled antibody conjugate. Following addition of enzyme-conjugated avidin, ELISPOT assay wells are developed with a suitable chromogen substrate yielding spots located at the former position of cells secreting the analyte under study.

Out of 8 aliphatic sulfonate compounds only three, having a NH- or OH-group in a suitable position, exerted a moderate inhibition (app. Ki ca. 2-6 mmol/l). 3. Amongst 14 benzene sulfonates tested only 2 compounds (5-nitrobenzene-sulfonate and 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzenesulfonate) inhibited with a Ki less than 5 mmol/l. 4. Out of 10 naphthalene sulfonates tested 8 inhibited with a Ki less than 5; the highest inhibition was seen with the NH-containing 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS), but no inhibition with 2 compounds containing an amino group. 5. From the polycyclic sulfonates pyrene-3-sulfonate and anthracene-1-sulfonate inhibited with a Ki of approximately 2 mmol/l, while no inhibition was seen with anthracene-2-sulfonate. 6.

In the study period of 1980 through 1984, 1.25% of pregnant women who had healthy babies (negative control group) were treated with co-trimoxazole during pregnancy. In those who had babies with congenital anomalies the rate of co-trimoxazole use was 2.31%. The case-control analysis showed a significant increase of co-trimoxazole use only in the groups of cleft lip +/- cleft palate and hypospadias. However, drug use was not higher during the critical period in either of the congenital anomaly groups. The distribution of component congenital anomalies in 13 cases affected by multiple congenital anomalies did not show any characteristic pattern. Respiratory and urinary system diseases were mentioned significantly more frequently in pregnancies of index patients' mothers. This analysis did not indicate any teratogenicity of co-trimoxazole.

These stocks were a solvent-refined oil (SRO), a hydrotreated and acid-washed white oil (WTO) and a severely hydrotreated and hydrocracked oil (HBO). Exposures were for 6 h per day, 5 days per week for ca. 4 weeks. There were four groups of rats for each study (10 per sex per group). Aerosol concentrations were ca. 0, 50, 210 and 1000 mg m-3 for each material; the mass median aerodynamic diameter was ca. 1 microns. Following the last exposure, all animals were sacrificed and necropsied. Samples were taken for serum chemistry, hematology, sperm morphology, weights of seven organs and histopathology on at least nine organs. Body weights and clinical signs were not affected by exposures. The only treatment-related changes were in the lung and associated lymph nodes. Both the wet weight of the lung and the dry/wet weight ratio increased in a concentration-related manner. Associated with the increased weight were accumulations of foamy alveolar macrophages, particularly in alveoli close to alveolar ducts. Mild infiltration by neutrophils was observed with WTO and SRO; thickened alveolar walls were noted with the highest concentration of HBO. These mild responses to exposures at very high concentrations indicate a low degree of toxicity for these aerosols.", "PMC3002965": "We investigated the effect of vitamin D3 metabolites on the release of the three interleukins (IL) IL 1, IL 2 and IL 3 by mononuclear cells. Models for the production of these mediators were the release of IL 1 by the murine macrophage cell line P388D1, of IL2 by rat spleen cells, and of IL 3 by the murine WEHI-3 cell line. IL 1 production was significantly increased with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) at 10(-10)M and above. 1,25(OH)2D3 did not stimulate cell proliferation as assessed with [methyl-3H]thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation. 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) were about 1000 times less effective than 1,25(OH)2D3. IL 2 production, by cultured rat spleen cells stimulated with Concanavalin A, was decreased by increasing concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3. The minimal effective dose varied between experiments and ranged from 10(-11) to 10(-8) M. Moreover, proliferation (3H-TdR incorporation) of mouse thymocytes treated with phytohemagglutinin and IL 1 was decreased in a dose-dependent fashion by 1,25(OH)2D3 starting at 10-11) M. This effect might be secondary to a decrease of endogenous IL 2 production. IL 3 release by WEHI-3 cells was significantly increased with 10(-11)-10(-9) M 1,25(OH)2D3, whereas higher concentrations were less effective or decreased IL 3 production. These results show that 1,25(OH)2D3 and, to a lesser extent, 24,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 have selective effects on lymphokine production. It is tempting to speculate that the actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 on bone might in part be mediated by lymphokines. Moreover, we suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 might not be an immunoregulator per se, but makes use of the immune system to exert its influence on one of its classical targets, namely the bone, and possibly on other connective tissues.", "PMC2217051": "The dependency at discharge instrument, developed to evaluate the needs for care of hospitalized patients on the day of discharge, was tested for its usefulness in measuring resource consumption in home health care. The instrument evaluates dependency in relation to bathing/hygiene, activity, technical procedures, and monitoring signs and symptoms. The sample used in this study consisted of 150 subjects admitted to one of three types of home health care agencies. Interrater reliability and internal consistency of the instrument were high. Factor analysis produced results similar to those of the developers for three of the four scale items. The item concerning need for assistance with procedures had a much lower loading, indicating that it had little in common with the other items. Criterion-based validity was measured by testing the instrument's ability to predict the number of registered nurse and home health aide visits, and length of enrollment. Findings indicated that the instrument had a modest level of criterion-based validity in predicting the use of registered nurse and home health aide services for the hospital-affiliated agency, but was relatively ineffective for public health and for-profit agencies.", "PMC3993919": "The application of capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to the chemical characterization of radiation-induced base products of calf thymus DNA is presented. Samples of calf thymus DNA irradiated in N2O-saturated aqueous solution were hydrolyzed with HCOOH, trimethylsilylated, and subjected to GC-MS analysis using a fused-silica capillary column. Hydrolysis conditions suitable for the simultaneous analysis of the radiation-induced products of all four DNA bases in a single run were determined. The trimethylsilyl derivatives of these products had excellent GC properties and easily interpretable mass spectra; an intense molecular ion (M+.) and a characteristic (M-CH3)+ ion were observed. The complementary use of t-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives was also demonstrated. These derivatives provided an intense characteristic (M-57)+ ion, which appeared as either the base peak or the second most intense ion in the spectra. All mass spectra obtained are discussed. Because of the excellent resolving power of capillary GC and the accurate high-sensitivity identification by MS, the capillary GC-MS is suggested as a very suitable technique for identification of altered bases removed from DNA by base excision-repair enzymes such as DNA glycosylases and, thus, as very useful for an understanding of the base excision-repair of DNA.", "PMC3171458": "To evaluate the single ECG lead with the maximal ST-segment elevation on admission as a modality suitable for monitoring ischemic injury and necrosis, the author correlated the single lead from 49-lead precordial maps and that from the corresponding standard ECGs with the ECG systems from which they derived. A total of 265 pairs of studies (14 per patient) from 20 patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction were used. Serial recordings were done on admission, at 12 predetermined time intervals during hospitalization, and at discharge. The amplitudes of ST-segment elevation, R waves, and Q waves of the single lead and all of the complexes of the corresponding precordial maps or standard ECGs were measured, using the same methodology. The single ECG lead correlated well with the precordial maps and the standard ECG. Although in serial studies the originally selected single lead was not the one displaying the maximal ST-segment elevation in 29% of the studies, it was always located on a locus immediately adjacent to the new lead in the grid recording the maximal ST. Changes in the precordial map or standard ECG were always detected by the corresponding single lead. The single lead from the standard ECG reflected changes in the precordial map, indicating that a precordial map is not necessary on admission for identification of the single lead. Correlations of R waves and Q waves from the single lead and the precordial map or the single lead and the standard ECG were not as good as the ones found for ST-segment elevation, although they provided monitoring of directional changes of the QRS complexes during hospitalization. Thus, a single lead from a precordial map or standard ECG is adequate for monitoring of the magnitude of ischemic injury in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction. The single lead also provides some information as to the evolution of changes in the precordial QRS complexes associated with infarction and maintains its traditional role of providing surveillance for arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities.", "PMC2109090": "Previous observations have indicated that Drosophila DNA contains a component that evolves so rapidly that it fails to hybridize between the DNAs of sibling species. To establish the reality of this component and study its properties, the fraction (about 20%) of Drosophila simulans (Dsim) DNA that fails to hybridize to Drosophila melanogaster (Dmel) DNA has been isolated. The majority of the hybridizable part of this isolated fraction (based on control tests on Dsim DNA) fails to hybridize with Dmel DNA under the conditions used for the initial fractionation. Clones of this fraction do hybridize with Dmel DNA at open criterion producing duplexes with greatly reduced thermal stability, indicating that the underlying process is rapid sequence divergence rather than loss of the homologous sequences by relatively large deletions. Cloned fragments from the nonhybridizing fraction from Dsim are more than 15% divergent from the Dmel homologues, whereas the fraction that does hybridize is only 3-5% divergent. In comparison, synonymous substitutions in the coding regions of five genes show a 9% average divergence between Dsim and Dmel. They appear to be intermediate in their degree of divergence between the hybridizing and nonhybridizing components.", "PMC4092016": "Sixteen of the depressed patients and nine of the manic patients, who were studied by Ashworth et al. (1982), were retested after clinical recovery. As on the previous occasion, each patient completed a repertory grid whose 10 elements were role titles and which employed 12 elicited constructs and one provided construct. After principal component analysis of each grid, various measures of cognitive structure and perception of self were derived. Whereas in the previous study the clinically depressed and manic patients had differed from one another, and usually also from normals, on 'cognitive simplicity', 'integration of self and others' and 'self-esteem', after recovery these differences had disappeared although there was a tendency for the previously depressed patients to view themselves as different from other people, and for the previously manic patients to have abnormally high self-esteem. However, for the most part, the cognitive abnormalities and features identified in the earlier study appear to have reflected the patients' clinical status rather than more permanent aspects of their thinking.", "PMC1971547": "1.

During and after the preparatory phase new DINs are recruited predominantly from the SOG. 4. A large variety of activity patterns was recorded during spontaneous starts.

A single 3.5 kb beta APP RNA transcript was detected using probes recognizing all forms of beta APP messenger RNA. No signal was detected with a probe specific for the alternately spliced Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) region. In Western blot analysis of protein extracts, antisera specific for either the cytoplasmic or extracellular parts of beta APP detected several proteins ranging from 105 to 140 kDa. None of these were recognized by an antiserum specific to the KPI insert of the beta APP. Multicolor immunofluorescence showed beta APP immunoreactivity in type I (GFAP+ A2B5-) astrocytes, distributed in a fibrillar pattern like that of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). No beta APP immunoreactivity was detected in oligodendrocytes (GC+) or in A2B5+ progenitor cells. Moreover, no cultured cells showed immunostaining with an antiserum specific for the KPI sequence of beta APP. We conclude that type I astrocytes in primary culture produce amyloid precursor protein, but that oligodendrocytes and their precursors do not. Moreover, type I astrocytes produce predominantly the beta APP subtypes which lacks the KPI sequence.", "PMC3856422": "Effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on mucus secretion by mucocytes of the fundal part of the rat stomach has been studied electron microscopically, morphometrically and biochemically. PGE2 is found to stimulate synthesis of glycoproteins and their secretion by the mucocytes that results in increasing the relative volume of Golgi complex and in decreasing that of secretory granules. Actinomycin does not affect and cycloheximide blocks the stimulating activity of prostaglandin. This demonstrates that prostaglandin produces its action at the posttranscriptional (translational) level controlling mucus secretion of mucocytes. Owing to the results of the investigation and of those previously obtained on incorporation of 3H-pentagastrin and 3H-histamine into the cells of the mucous tunic, at least two mechanisms are supposed to control the gastric mucus secretion.", "PMC3162019": "Evidence is presented for the existence of synchrony between the spike trains of muscle afferents of the passive cat medial gastrocnemius muscle held at fixed length. Synchrony between the spike trains of a population of muscle afferents was quantified by means of a synchronization index (Is), derived from spike-triggered averages of the muscle-nerve neurogram and the rectified neurogram. A previously used test based solely upon the neurogram average (Watt, Stauffer, Taylor, Reinking & Stuart, 1976) is shown to be invalid. The differences between experimentally derived Is values and theoretical Is values derived for the condition of asynchrony were compared to estimated confidence limits for those differences. This comparison revealed that twenty-two of fifty-three muscle-afferent spike trains whose rectified averages satisfied certain conditions for interpreting the Is were synchronized with the discharge of other afferents. The form of the rectified averages of another eight afferents suggested that these afferents might also have been synchronized. Synchrony in the discharge of muscle afferents was found in three experiments in which the neurogram was recorded from a single nerve branch to medial gastrocnemius, as well as in the data of experiments in which the whole muscle nerve was used. The degree of synchrony was similar for Ia, spindle group II and Ib afferents. The magnitude of the synchrony found in these experiments was judged by comparison to the results of analog simulations and the increase in Is values resulting from the application of small, quick stretches to the medial gastrocnemius muscle. The degree of synchrony found on average was approximately equivalent to that of a single spike occurring once for every four discharges of the reference spike train. Simulations were performed to determine the distortion of monosynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) obtained by spike-triggered averaging which would be produced by synchrony between the spike trains of Ia and spindle group II afferents of the magnitude found in this study. These simulations indicate that the apparent amplitude would be increased by approximately 4 microV on average. Both the 10-90% rise time and the half-width would increase, the effects being greater for smaller e.p.s.p.s. Consequently, the synchrony found in this study is of most concern in the study of small post-synaptic potentials, such as those due to spindle group II afferents.", "PMC3652036": "Hypoxic cell radiosensitizers enhance the cytotoxicity of several common chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo. Although this process has generally been called sensitization, few studies have documented true potentiation. We have used Chinese hamster V79 spheroids to study chemosensitization and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to specifically evaluate the roles of sensitizer binding and hypoxia in the effect. By using the median effect analysis to quantify the interactions of the agents, we conclude that marked potentiation can indeed be achieved. Somewhat greater potentiation was observed at increased depths within the spheroids, but the relative change was less than predicted on the basis of the decreasing oxygen tension. Further, increased toxicity did not necessarily lead to increased chemopotentiation, nor was potentiation directly related to the metabolism/binding of the nitrofuran. Thus, chemopotentiation is clearly a complicated process, highly dependent upon the sensitizer to antitumor drug ratio and the exposure conditions.", "PMC3618186": "VIII nerve compound action potentials evoked by electrical stimulation are decomposed in series of pure-tone derived potentials using masking. These potentials are in turn decomposed in a series of contributions from various frequency bands by adding high-pass masking noises. The amplitudes of the derived signals are thought to be proportional to the number of fibres activated by the masking acoustical stimulations. Thus the density of nerve fibres stimulated along the basilar membrane by pure tones as a function of frequency and intensity can be estimated.", "PMC2225082": "We have traced the nucleolar chromatin from early prophase to the metaphase stage. In prophase this chromatin begins to condense and in metaphase it is fully condensed.

To study its structure, regulation of expression, and physiological roles, we have cloned and characterized the structural gene (bpf) encoding this protease from Bacillus subtilis. DNA sequence analysis suggests this protease is synthesized as a preproenzyme (Mr = 92,000). Through processing at both the NH2 and COOH termini, it is gradually converted into various forms with molecular mass ranging from 80 to 48 kDa. Shortening the 3' end of bpf demonstrates that at least 290 amino acid residues from the COOH-terminus of bacillopeptidase F are not required for either catalytic activity or secretion. Bacillopeptidase F exhibits sequence similarity with several serine proteases. Its gene is found immediately downstream from the fts operon which was mapped at 135 degrees on the B. subtilis genetic linkage map. Inactivation of the chromosomal copy of bpf shows no effect on cell growth and sporulation. A triple protease-deficient strain (WB300 with the structural genes for bacillopeptidase F and two other major proteases inactivated) was constructed to serve as a better expression host for the production and secretion of foreign proteins.", "PMC2136759": "To evaluate the comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of various antihypertensive medications in persons aged 35 through 64 years with diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or greater and no known coronary heart disease, we used the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, which is a computer simulation of overall mortality as well as the mortality, morbidity, and cost of coronary heart disease in the US population. From the pooled literature, we estimated the antihypertensive and total cholesterol effects of various antihypertensive regimens. For 20 years of simulated therapy from 1990 through 2010, the cost per year of life saved was projected to be $10,900 for propranolol hydrochloride; $16,400 for hydrochlorothiazide; $31,600 for nifedipine; $61,900 for prazosin hydrochloride; and $72,100 for captopril. Doubling the cholesterol effects of the agents under study did not significantly change their effectiveness because, in general, lowering diastolic blood pressure by 1 mm Hg was equivalent to lowering the cholesterol level by 6%.

The interrelationships between these parameters, and the exchange mechanism of cholesterol sulfate between plasma and erythrocytes are discussed.", "PMC1636675": "The effect of the diterpene, forskolin, on pathways for conductive Cl- transport was analyzed using isolated skins of Bufo viridis. Forskolin did not stimulate the voltage-activated Cl- movement from mucosa to serosa; the Lorentzian component in the power density spectrum, which was present at serosa positive clamp potentials under control conditions, decreased significantly. The observation that stimulation of cytosolic adenosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) by forskolin has no effect on the voltage-activated Cl- transport argues against control of this pathway by cAMP. Our data further demonstrate that the forskolin-activated Cl- conductive pathway is also permeable for NO3-. This pathway was studied in absence of mucosal Cl-, which eliminates Cl- movement through the voltage-activated pathway. With SO4(2-) and Cl- on the mucosal and serosal sides, respectively, this forskolin-induced pathway displayed a linear current-voltage relationship. The associated Lorentzians increased at serosa negative clamp potentials. Transepithelial current and plateau value of the Lorentzian were related by a quadratic function, which suggests voltage-independence of number and open-close probability of these conductance sites. Morphological sites for voltage-activated and forskolin-induced conductive Cl- transport remain to be identified.", "PMC2862246": "Intravenous GABA inhibited, in a bicuculline-sensitive manner, contractions of the urinary bladder induced by preganglionic nerve stimulation in urethane anaesthetized rats, while it had no significant effect on contractions produced by postganglionic nerve stimulation. In addition, intravenous GABA strongly inhibited DMPP-induced bladder contractions; this effect was also prevented by bicuculline. These experiments suggest that GABA inhibits excitatory neurotransmission in rat pelvic ganglia through a mechanism involving, at least in part, the activation of postsynaptic GABA A receptors.", "PMC2108801": "The explanation for the increased frequency of troubles with digoxin therapy in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases is debated. The reported effects of hypoxia in vivo on myocardial levels of digoxin are contradictory, and there have been few studies on the effects of hypercapnia. In the past, it has been shown in rat myocardial tissue at rest in vitro that hypoxia decreased and hypercapnic acidosis increased the digoxin uptake. We performed a new study in vitro in an isolated beating rat heart perfused at constant flow (37 degrees C) and stimulated at a constant frequency (6 Hz). The performances were recorded with an intraventricular balloon equipped with a tip-manometer catheter. The action of digoxin was studied by recording systolic pressure (PS) and diastolic pressure (PD), the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP = PS - PD), the (dP/dt)max, and the ratio (dP/dt)max/PS. First, the heart was perfused for 30 min with a modified Tyrode's solution perfusate aerated with carbogen (pH = 7.40; PCO2 = 37 mmHg; PO2 = 530 mmHg) (1 mmHg = 133.32 Pa). Various parameters of contractions were recorded (initial control values). Then the heart was perfused for 15 min with Tyrode's solution aerated either with a hypoxic gas mixture (pH = 7.41; PCO2 = 36 mmHg; PO2 = 122 mmHg), a hypercapnic gas mixture (pH = 7.08; PCO2 75 mmHg; PO2 = 485 mmHg), or a hypoxic-hypercapnic gas mixture (pH = 7.09; PCO2 = 73 mmHg; PO2 = 124 mmHg).

Using a histochemical tetrazolium method for MAO-B with tyramine as substrate and chlorgyline for the inhibition of MAO-A, black C57 mice were found to have a higher brain MAO-B activity than similar aged albino NMRI mice. The difference, which was in general density rather than distribution, included the basal ganglia and the substantia nigra. The higher activity in C57 mice may explain differences in the susceptibility to MPTP.", "PMC2767187": "The responses of 82 simple cells and 41 complex cells in area 17 of anesthetized and paralysed cats were examined with light bars of different length. For 84% of the simple cells and 66% of the complex cells the preferred axis of orientation of a stationary flashing long bar (orientational selectivity) and the preferred axis of movement of a small spot were parallel. As a consequence, the axis of maximal response to a moving light spot was mostly orthogonal to the optimal axis of a moving bar. Thus, a single cell responds to two perpendicular axes of preferred movement one for a long bar and one for a light spot, respectively. For both axes independent direction preferences could be distinguished. Additional preferred axes of movement between the two orthogonal extremes could be found with moving bars of intermediate lengths. This can be explained by the fact that cells with a pronounced response to a moving spot showed a strong tendency for intermediate bar length to elicit responses consisting of a superposition of both components. Therefore, decreasing bar length resulted in a gradual rotation of the preferred direction of movement from orthogonal to parallel with respect to the orientational axis, rather than to a mere widening of the tuning curve. Accordingly, the change in orientation selectivity with decreasing bar length is a regular transition from the orientation dependent response to a response type that depends only on the movement axis of the spot. Thus, in a simple model, the resulting response characteristic can be interpreted as an average of both components weighted according to the length of the stimulus.", "PMC2138226": "Marital adjustment, psychological distress, health attitudes and prevalence of musculoskeletal pain symptoms were studied and compared between 63 chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients and their spouses.

The CLBP patients experienced significantly more feelings of guilt at having pain than their spouses. The patients experienced significantly more internal control, while their spouses experienced more external locus control of health. The female spouses had had significantly more musculoskeletal pain symptoms in neck and shoulders during the past week than the male spouses.

Extracts and media obtained from labeled cell cultures contained a protein that bound to an S3, but not to an S8 or inactivated S3 immunoadsorbent. After elution, the bound protein showed a single band on isoelectric focusing which corresponded in isoelectric point to one of the serum anti-S3 antibodies of the donor rabbit.

After biotinylation of apical or basolateral surfaces of confluent monolayers grown on polycarbonate filters, GPI-anchored proteins are identified by their shift from a Triton X-114 detergent-rich phase to a detergent-poor phase in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. All GPI-anchored proteins detected (3-9 per cell type, at least 13 different proteins) are found to be apically polarized; no GPI-anchored protein is observed preferentially localized to the basal surface. One of the GPI-anchored proteins is identified as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Survey of MDCK II-RCAr, a mutant cell line with a pleiotropic defect in galactosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (that presumably affects GPI anchors) also reveals an apical polarization of all GPI-anchored proteins. In contrast, analysis of MDCK II-ConAr (a mutant cell line with an unknown defect in glycosylation) revealed five GPI-anchored proteins, two of which appeared relatively unpolarized. Our results indicate that the polarized apical distribution of GPI-anchored proteins is highly conserved across species and tissue-type and may depend on glycosylation.", "PMC2821521": "The reduced febrile response in aged man has been noted since the beginning of clinical thermometry. Our previous research on aged rabbits and squirrel monkeys disclosed a similar reduced fever, presumably due to a decrease in central receptors for endogenous pyrogen. However, because central alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) appears to have a potent role in physiological control of fever, it may be that increased release of the peptide is responsible for the reduced febrile response in aged animals. To test this idea, antiserum specific to MSH was administered intracerebroventricularly to rabbits of known age. The antiserum given according to three schedules of treatment augmented fever caused by IV injections of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in young (less than 2 years) male and female rabbits. Aged female rabbits (3-5+ years) and females aged 2-3 years showed significant augmentation of fever only after pretreatment plus acute injection of antiserum. A single ICV injection of MSH (200 ng) reduced fever in all groups with the greatest antipyretic effect in the aged females. The results indicate that while aged rabbits have an increased antipyretic response to central MSH, binding of the endogenous peptide does not result in marked increases in fever in these animals. Thus, whereas a change in central MSH sensitivity may contribute to reduced fever in aged homeotherms, a reduction in central pyrogen receptors appears to be the most parsimonious explanation.", "PMC2154371": "T and B lymphocyte antigen receptors exhibit single transmembrane spanning regions and very short, three to five amino acid, C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. Ligation of these receptors leads, apparently through GTP binding protein activation, to rapid stimulation of a polyphosphoinositide specific phosphodiesterase (PPI-PDE). T lymphocyte antigen receptors (alpha beta) are coupled to PPI-PDE via a receptor associated complex of membrane proteins, designated CD3. Although an analogous transducer complex is presumed to exist in B cells, no such structure has been defined. We utilized in vitro [32P]phosphorylation to identify and characterize a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) associated phosphoprotein complex which appears to represent a B cell analog of CD3. The phosphoprotein complex consists of three N-glycosylated polypeptides which occur as disulfide linked dimers, non-covalently associated with mIg. The complex associated with mIgM (pp32, pp34 and pp37 subunits) differs from that associated with mIgD (pp33, pp34 and pp37 subunits), and the isotype specific phosphoprotein (pp32 or pp33) appears to exist as a disulfide linked heterodimer with either pp34 or pp37.

The frequencies of extended haplotypes, defined as haplotypes of specific HLA-B, DR, BF, C2, C4A, and C4B allelic combinations, occurring more frequently than expected, were compared on patient chromosomes, on normal chromosomes from the study families, and on chromosomes from normal families. Over half of patient chromosomes consisted almost entirely of two extended haplotypes [HLA-B8, DR3, SC01] and [HLA-B44, DR7, FC31] which, with nonextended HLA-DR7, accounted for the previously observed HLA markers of this disease: HLA-B8, DR3, and DR7. There was no increase in HLA-DR3 on nonextended haplotypes or in other extended haplotypes with HLA-DR3 or DR7. The distribution of homozygotes and heterozygotes for HLA-DR3 and DR7 was consistent with recessive inheritance of the major histocompatibility complex-linked susceptibility gene for gluten-sensitive enteropathy. On the other hand, by odds ratio analysis and from the sum of DR3 and DR7 homozygotes compared with DR3/DR7 heterozygotes, there was an increase in heterozygotes and a decrease in homozygotes suggesting the presence of modifying phenomena.", "PMC3203174": "Communicative hydrocephalus (CH) is considered as one of the late sequelae of severe craniocerebral injury.

We have found that almost 3.9% of 335 severe craniocerebral-injured patients develop communicative hydrocephalus. These patients were unconscious for various periods of time, therefore the triad described by Hakim and Adams cannot by itself lead the clinician to suspect possible development of communicative hydrocephalus. It is suggested that in prolonged coma, or in the presence of arrest in clinical progress in conscious craniocerebral-injured patients, communicative hydrocephalus should be suspected.", "PMC1347409": "The dynamics of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade-induced transitions between two types of intracellularly recorded spontaneous membrane potential oscillation from cat thalamic neurons have been studied using non-linear dynamics techniques. We report that, as previously predicted by theoretical studies, the number of degrees of freedom of these oscillations (the minimal number of independent variables governing the activity) is small, i.e. they are low dimensional. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists DL-2-amino-5-phosphono-valeric acid and ketamine, which transformed one type of oscillation into another, decreased the calculated dimension. DL-2-Amino-5-phosphono-valeric acid had no effect on the dimension when Mg2+ was present in the perfusion medium. The decrease in dimension was gradual and its time-course had a sigmoidal shape.

The SAS values of six TcvON2S2 and one TcvON4 (D,L-HMPAO) complexes were calculated from their x-ray crystallography data. The rank order of in vitro stability of these compounds, as measured by ligand exchange reaction, is directly related to that of the SAS values.

In this investigation, raccoons fed a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant virus in a sponge bait developed rabies virus-neutralizing antibody (0.6-54.0 units) and resisted street rabies virus infection 28 and 205 days after feeding. Additional raccoons immunized by oral infusion with attenuated antigenic variants of rabies virus strains CVS-11 and ERA failed to develop rabies virus-neutralizing antibody.

The mesenchymal complex in ossification includes several types of cells of mesenchymal origin (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, chondroclasts, vasothelial and haemopoetic cells) taking part in the processes of cartilage erosion, new formation, growth and shaping of bone tissue. The complex includes also capillary loops and other components of connective tissue located among the remnants of calcified cartilage matrix. In the degenerative-osteogenic zone of the proximal and distal growth cartilage of the tibia, the volume density decreases from the epiphysis to the diaphysis. From the peripheral to the central sections of the zones, there is almost no variation of volume density.

Serum triglyceride levels were lowered significantly. The mean serum cholesterol concentration fell to less than 200 mg/dl after four weeks on the diet, and the high-density lipoprotein/cholesterol ratio increased. Serum glucose and uric acid concentrations, which changed initially, returned to baseline after the third week. Minimal elevation of SGPT concentration was the only change revealed by liver function tests. In general, the patients were hypertensive, and their blood pressure levels were significantly lower after fasting. Our data suggest that supplemental fasting deserves further study as a method of weight loss in obese persons.

The cytostatic activity of MA that had been primed with rMuIFN-gamma against Lewis lung adenocarcinoma cells was augmented extensively by exposure to MDP-Lys(L18) for a minimum of 15 min, though such treatment in the reverse sequence interfered with the effects of rMuIFN-gamma on MA. The binding assays revealed that rMuIFN-gamma bound to MA with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.93 X 10(-9) M (16,000 binding molecules/cell), while MDP-Lys(L18) bound nonspecifically and was endocytosed by MA at 37 degrees. The amount of MDP-Lys(L18) bound to the rMuIFN-gamma-primed MA was significantly greater than that bound to the MA without rMuIFN-gamma priming. A small increase in the amount of MDP-Lys(L18) associated with MA was also observed at 4 degrees, but the amount was one order of magnitude less than that at 37 degrees. The binding of rMuIFN-gamma to MA was significantly suppressed by priming with MDP-Lys(L18). These results indicate that the binding of rMuIFN-gamma in preference to MDP-Lys(L18) to MA is of great importance in the mechanisms of MA activation.", "PMC3793771": "Electrodiagnostic studies of peripheral nerve function remain a valuable adjunct to a thorough clinical examination.

In spite of emergency retransplantation, the patient died 8 days later, due to systemic aspergillosis. Thrombosis of hepatic artery was particular by the importance of gaz-forming infection, and emphasizes the role of rejection.

We report on a 19th century series of American black slaves from a single cemetery near Charleston, South Carolina, that possessed notably smaller crown sizes. Analysis identifies a characteristic set of differences compared to caucasians, including retention of large maxillary lateral incisors and disproportionately large premolars and molars. Regression of principal components scores (derived from the mesiodistal diameters) on the sum of all diameters (used here as a measure of overall tooth mass) confirms a basic ethnic difference between black and white odontometrics: significantly more of the tooth mass is apportioned to the cheek teeth (premolars, molars) in blacks than whites. The difference (expressed as residuals from linear regression on tooth mass) holds for the several groups assessed here despite considerable intergroup variability in tooth sizes. Potential explanations for the notably small diameters of this plantation series are speculative, but may involve kin-based divergences and/or reflect the natural intergroup differences extant in the African slave sources.", "PMC1851644": "The Ah receptor is a soluble protein complex that mediates carcinogenesis by a wide range of environmental pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and polychlorinated aromatic compounds. The best understood activity of the receptor concerns its role in the induction of cytochrome P450IA1. We undertook a somatic cell genetic analysis of P450IA1 induction using the mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa-1. Clones of Hepa-1 were isolated that are defective in induction of P450IA1. Evidence was obtained that the clones are mutational in origin. Cell fusion experiments demonstrated that a few of the mutants are dominant, while the majority are recessive. The dominant mutants were shown to synthesize a repressor of P450IA1 transcription. The recessive mutants were assigned to 4 complementation groups (probably corresponding to 4 different genes). Complementation group A corresponds to the P450IA1 structural gene. Mutations in the B, C and D genes all affect functioning of the Ah receptor. A 'reverse selection procedure', whereby cells that express P450IA1 inducibility can be selected from a majority population of cells lacking inducibility, was developed. The reverse selection procedure was used to isolate transfectants of representative recessive mutants in which the mutational defects are complemented by exogenously applied genomic DNA. A human DNA-derived transfectant of a C- mutant was used to clone the human C gene. The C gene is not the ligand-binding subunit of the Ah receptor but is a protein that is required for translocation of Ah receptor-ligand complexes from cytoplasm to nucleus. In analogous experiments the dominant gene from one of the dominant mutants was transfected into wild-type Hepa-1 cells. Success in transfecting the dominant gene should provide the means for cloning it.", "PMC3426803": "An inhibitor of neutral proteinases was isolated from the cytosol of bovine leukocytes by anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q and gel filtration on a HPLC TSK column. The gel filtration resulted in two fractions with inhibitory activity which could be identified by sodium dodecyl sulphate-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under nonreducing conditions as dimer and monomer of the inhibitor. The latter was shown to be homogeneous in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa, with calibrated HPLC a molecular mass of 36.5 kDa has been determined. Isoelectric focusing followed by Western blot analysis revealed four bands in the pH range of 5.0 to 5.9. The inhibitor was found in bovine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), whereas lymphocytes and monocytes lacked this protein. No immunological cross-reactivity between the described cell-derived PMN-inhibitor (PMN-I) and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor was detectable. The mechanism of inhibition for the serine proteinases chymotrypsin, trypsin, pancreatic elastase and leukocyte elastase was studied. PMN-I could not bind to PMS-chymotrypsin.

A variety of systemic manifestations may be found, including fever, anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and a broad spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, presumably associated with specific humoral factors produced by the tumor. Histologic examination shows the characteristic features of angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia. Two variants have been described, i.e., the plasma cell type (active stage) associated with systemic manifestations, and the hyaline vascular type (quiescent stage). Surgical removal of the tumor ensures permanent (local and systemic) recovery in the overwhelming majority of cases. A role of microorganisms in the etiology of this condition has been suggested.

Thereafter, the levels decreased to the control by 100 hr. During the treatment period, the glucose concentration of the control aqueous humor and vitreous body remained at approximately 7.5 mM and 4.3 mM, respectively. These changes in glucose after HC administration were quite different from that of the lens in regard to the extent of increase and the lag time required to produce glucose accumulation. By in vitro and in ovo experiments, it was found that the environment surrounding lens, medium and ocular fluids, greatly influenced the level of lenticular glucose rather than any changes metabolic activities in the lens.

Under the conditions used to assemble IF in vitro from other cultured cell lines, 10 nm filaments are formed after 2 cycles of disassembly-assembly from PC12 IF-enriched cytoskeletal preparations; the 57 kDa protein is the major component of the final IF pellet. The 57 kDa protein is immunologically related to the BHK-21 fibroblast 55 kDa protein (vimentin), but a comparison of the peptide maps of PC12 57 kDa and BHK 55 kDa indicates that they are different proteins. With the use of a polyclonal antiserum to the PC12 57 kDa protein, immunofluorescence observations of PC12 cells not treated with NGF reveal a juxtanuclear \"knot\"-like structure. After NGF treatment, the \"knots\" are less prominent and many IF arrays are seen coursing through the cytoplasm and extending into the neurites. These immunofluorescence observations of the distribution of IF are corroborated by fine-structural analyses. SDS-PAGE analyses indicate that IF-enriched cytoskeletons isolated from NGF-treated cells have a polypeptide composition similar to that of untreated cells, that is, the 57 kDa protein remains the major polypeptide. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses show that untreated and NGF-treated PC12 cells also contain relatively minor amounts of the 68, 150, and 200 kDa neurofilament triplet (NFT) proteins. Under immunofluorescence, only 5% of untreated PC12 cells are found to contain a juxtanuclear \"knot\" labeled with NFT antibodies, but with time following NGF treatment, the number of fluorescent cells increases. After about 2 weeks of NGF treatment, all of the PC12 cells appear to contain NFT antibody-positive filamentous structures. As assessed by immunofluorescence, the NFT polypeptides appear to codistribute with the 57 kDa protein in both untreated and NGF-treated PC12 cells. These data indicate that PC12 cells contain IF composed of a complex set of polypeptides, including a previously unidentified 57 kDa IF protein. While NGF may induce production of NFT polypeptides, there does not appear to be a \"switch\" from known mesenchymal IF polypeptide expression to NFT polypeptide expression upon stimulation of PC12 cells with NGF.", "PMC3909081": "The MIC of two hundred and seven anaerobic bacterial strains was determined by an agar dilution method for five antibiotics (piperacillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefalotin, metronidazole). 100% of the strains were susceptible to carbenicillin (MIC less than or equal to 128 mg/l), 97% to piperacillin (MIC less than or equal to 16), 86% to metronidazole (MIC less than or equal to 4), 70% to ampicillin (MIC less than or equal to 4) and 68% to cefalotin (MIC less than or equal to 8).

The program included 28,585 patients (of whom 26,892 provided sufficient information by questionnaire for an assessment of efficacy and race), and the participation of 7,009 primary-care physicians. After four weeks of treatment, patients had a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 21 mmHg and in diastolic blood pressure of 13 mmHg. The magnitude of these reductions did not differ appreciably with respect to age, sex, race, or previous therapy. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by at least 11 mmHg in 55% of patients and systolic blood pressure was reduced by at least 16 mmHg in 59% of patients. Physicians' assessments indicated that 86% of patients achieved satisfactory control of blood pressure by the end of the study. The physicians' global assessment of the effectiveness of treatment indicated that the combination was better than previous therapy in 82% of patients; 91% of physicians planned to continue treatment with the fixed combination. There were no adverse experiences that had not been reported previously, and only dizziness exceeded an incidence of 1%.

Neither of these traditional approaches provided much insight into the complex processes that often support animal social learning. By combining ethological focus on social learning as it occurs in natural habitat with analytical techniques developed in the psychological laboratory, contemporary researchers have made considerable progress in describing the many ways in which social interactions influence behavioural development in animals.

The effects of three agents reported to inhibit phospholipase A2 activity (quinacrine, spermine and indomethacin), tubocurarine and dantrolene were examined on these contractures. Contractures induced by 1% halothane (0.26 +/- 0.02 g) (mean +/- SEM) were increased (0.60 +/- 0.04 g) if suxamethonium 50 mmol litre-1 was also in the bathing medium. Suxamethonium-induced contractures (0.22 +/- 0.03 g) were also enhanced when halothane was present (0.51 +/- 0.03 g). Spermine, indomethacin and dantrolene antagonized both halothane- and suxamethonium-induced contractures. Quinacrine potentiated contractures induced by either halothane or suxamethonium. Contractures induced by suxamethonium were antagonized by tubocurarine; however, contractures induced by halothane were not antagonized by tubocurarine.

The size was found to be 4400 daltons (D) by amino acid analysis and 6000 D by SDS-PAGE, and the pI was 8.3 as determined by isoelectric focusing. There was no cross-reactivity detected between the two Amb. V antigens by immunodiffusion and IEP with the use of hyperimmune antisera raised against crude or highly purified antigens. Cross-reactivity between the two Amb. V antigens was further investigated by inhibition double antibody radioimmunoassay by using the sera of nine selected ragweed-allergic patients who had recently been immunized with either mixed short-giant ragweed pollen extract or with short ragweed extract alone and who had IgG antibodies (Ab) to Amb.t. V and generally to Amb.a. V. Unlabeled Amb.t. V did not inhibit the binding of 125I-Amb.a. V to the IgG Ab in any of the sera tested. Conversely, unlabeled Amb.a. V produced some inhibition of the binding of 125I-Amb.t. V to the patients' IgG Ab, primarily in those patients who had received immunotherapy with short ragweed alone. This weak cross-reactivity was probably a result of the primary structural homology between the two protein allergens. The sera from two groups of ragweed-allergic individuals were investigated for the presence of IgG and IgE Ab to Amb.t. V. The presence of IgG Ab was found to be associated both with previous (or current) immunotherapy with giant ragweed extract and with HLA-Dw2.

The accumulation of FDG did not correlate with histologic grade of the tumors, but there was a clear correlation (r = 0.86, P less than 0.001) between the proportion of the cells in S + G2/M phases of the cell cycle and the intensity of FDG accumulation. The uptake of FDG by the tumor also correlated with the percentage of S-phase cells (r = 0.82, P less than 0.001). The result suggests that enhanced glucose metabolism, measured by FDG uptake, is associated with the proliferative activity of the tumor. Thus, imaging with FDG may offer a new method to assess the aggressiveness of human cancer growth in vivo.", "PMC3746411": "Several identified interneurons in the cricket cercal afferent system display directional sensitivity to wind stimuli: the spike frequency of these cells depends on the wind direction with respect to the animal's body. Factors determining the directional sensitivity of one of these identified interneurons (interneuron 10-3) were studied in detail. This cell has 3 dendritic branches that arborize in 3 distinct regions of the terminal abdominal ganglion. Using 2 independent methods, it was demonstrated that the dendrites have different receptive fields to wind stimuli. First, small patches of filiform hairs, whose afferents projected to individual dendrites, were isolated and selectively stimulated. In each case the response of the cell matched the receptive field of the afferents in the patch. Second, a laser beam directed through the stereo dissecting microscope was used to photoinactivate small portions of the cell in situ during intracellular recording. By isolating or ablating individual dendrites, the contributions of each of the 3 dendrites to the overall receptive field were assessed. Although the receptive field of the whole cell could be predicted by a summation of the receptive fields of all 3 dendrites, the precise directional sensitivity of the cell could not be predicted by a simple linear summation of the receptive fields of each dendrite. Two factors were found to account for this nonlinearity of summation. The first factor was polysynaptic inhibition from other interneurons within the terminal abdominal ganglion. Wind directions that activate inhibition in interneuron 10-3 were identified, and the specific classes of filiform afferents that activate the inhibitory pathway were determined. The net effect of the inhibition was to \"sharpen\" the directional sensitivity of 10-3 by selectively decreasing the cell's response to specific excitatory inputs. The second factor that contributed to directional sensitivity was the complex electroanatomy of the interneuron. The probable location of the spike-initiating zone (SIZ) was determined by using the laser photoinactivation technique. The relative efficacies of synaptic inputs onto the 3 different branches were then interpreted with respect to their different electrotonic distances from the SIZ. On the basis of the data obtained in this report, we present a qualitative model for the basis of directional sensitivity in this cell.", "PMC3380901": "One-hundred consecutive patients undergoing aesthetic surgical procedures with adjunctive intravenous sedation in an office-based ambulatory surgical facility were monitored by an anesthesiologist with an ECG, stethoscope, automatic sphygmomanometer, and pulse oximeter. The pulse oximeter detected hypoxemia occurring intraoperatively and in the recovery room earlier than the traditional methods of monitoring. By detecting early drops in the SAO2 with the pulse oximeter, appropriate corrective measures could be instituted and titration of intravenous anesthetics adjusted, avoiding progression to more profound hypoxemia and thus resulting in the safer delivery of anesthesia. The pulse oximeter is a useful and recommended adjunct to the traditional methods of monitoring in an office-based ambulatory surgical facility.", "PMC2211862": "The author discusses comprehensive care of musicians, which requires an understanding of music and the evolution and design of musical instruments.

Immature oocytes recovered from follicles (2-5 mm) of unstimulated ovaries were cultured for 24-25 h in modified TCM 199 medium supplemented with heat-treated day 20 cow serum, luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol 17-B. In vitro capacitated, frozen-thawed spermatozoa were injected into the ooplasm, and the injected oocytes were cultured for an additional 24-28 h. Twenty-one percent (21/101) of the sperm-injected oocytes contained a sperm within the ooplasm; however, only 2% (2/101) cleaved. The remaining oocytes either did not contain a sperm or had degenerated. After oocyte activation induced by a 5 min incubation in 1 microM A23187, sperm nuclear decondensation occurred in the A23187-activated, injected oocytes but not in the unactivated, injected controls (37% vs. 0% after 3 h). Those injected, activated oocytes that contained a male pronucleus also exhibited a female pronucleus and second polar body. Furthermore, a significantly higher number (28%, 6/21) of the injected, activated oocytes cleaved to a two- to four-cell stage after 48 h than did the injected, unactivated oocytes (4%). These results indicate that, unlike hamster and rabbit oocytes, bovine oocytes are not sufficiently stimulated by the injection procedure to complete meiosis, but, upon activation by calcium ionophore, they will undergo normal-appearing cleavage development following fertilization by sperm injection.", "PMC3171119": "A 41-year-old man ingested 6.8 g of verapamil in a suicide attempt.

The morphology of bacteriophage particles and the biological properties of the bacteriophage make it related to the plague bacteriophage isolated by D'Errel. The molecular masses of the compared bacteriophages are almost identical being 26.4 +/- 0.4 Md for RD2 and 24.7 +/- 0.2 Md for D'Errel bacteriophage. The DNAs of the bacteriophages share 80% of homology and possess 15 nonhomologous regions scattered along the genomes. The phages are serologically related. The DNAs of both bacteriophages give the similar pattern of hydrolysis by restriction endonuclease EcoRV, but have the different sensitivity to many other restriction endonucleases. The protein specter of bacteriophage RD2 contains 18 polypeptides (11 minor ones), while the one of D'Errel bacteriophage contains 7 polypeptides similar in molecular mass with the polypeptides of RD2. The bacteriophage RD2 cannot be considered one of the plague causative agents of bacteriophages since the region where it has been isolated has a long epidemiological and epizootical record of absence of plague.", "PMC3052159": "The haemodynamic responses associated with inflation of the antigravity suit (G suit, aviation type) to 8.0 kPa were studied in a series of 40 patients who underwent neurosurgical operations in the sitting position. The study showed statistically significant increases in systolic arterial pressure (p less than 0.005) and mean central venous pressure (p less than 0.001) with inflation of the suit. The systolic arterial and mean central venous pressures remained significantly elevated immediately before deflation of the suit at the end of the operation (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.005 respectively). The addition of 0.8-1.0 kPa positive end expiratory pressure during suit inflation was also investigated. A further increase in central venous pressure occurred but this did not achieve statistical significance.", "PMC3588541": "The fetal behaviour of asymmetrical growth retarded fetuses was compared with that of a control group of healthy fetuses. Fetuses underwent simultaneous cardiotocographic and echographic examinations for two consecutive hours at 36-38 weeks of gestation. The distribution of gross fetal body movements, fetal breathing movements and fetal eye movements was analysed during the different fetal heart rate patterns. Furthermore, the incidence and organization of fetal behavioural states was investigated. The degree of vascular peripheral resistance was also evaluated by means of pulsed doppler ultrasonic equipment. Growth retarded fetuses were divided into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of end diastolic flow in the fetal thoracic descending aorta. Growth retarded fetuses showed a delay in the integration of behavioural patterns and a lower coincidence of behavioural states. These findings are particularly evident in the fetuses with a severe increase of peripheral vascular resistance (absence of end diastolic flow in descending aorta). Thus, we suggest that a delay in central nervous system development is present in asymmetrical growth retarded fetuses and that there is a possible relationship of this delay to the degree of peripheral vascular resistance.", "PMC3187819": "The calcium antagonist nimodipine (Nimotop; Bayer AG Leverkusen) has been shown to prevent cerebral vasospasm after aneurysm surgery. Ten patients with clinical and angiographic evidence of vasospasm showed accompanying delays in central conduction time, quantified by somatosensory evoked potential measurements, but nimodipine infusion markedly improved neurological status and level of consciousness in all cases within 10-60 minutes. Conduction time was simultaneously reduced on the affected side. No focal deficits developed during therapy (mean 7.1 days) with nimodipine, which also appears to be effective in relieving existing vasospasm.

Each drug resulted in a significant dose-related depression in uterine, ovarian and anterior pituitary gland weights. Additionally, plasma and pituitary concentrations of prolactin fell with increasing dose of either indole whereas pituitary levels of LH and FSH were positively correlated with dose. There was no difference in effectiveness between the two drugs. Adult male hamsters treated for 10 weeks with daily afternoon injections of melatonin and a blank beeswax pellet had depressed testicular and accessory organ weights and plasma and pituitary concentrations of prolactin. Implantation of a 1 mg melatonin or CM beeswax pellet in hamsters concurrently receiving daily afternoon injections of melatonin prevented the organ weight and hormonal changes, except for plasma prolactin. Adult male hamsters treated for 10 weeks with daily afternoon injections of CM and a blank beeswax pellet had depressed reproductive organ weights and pituitary and plasma concentrations of prolactin; this depression in hormonal values and organ weights was totally prevented if the CM-injected hamsters were also bearing a beeswax-melatonin pellet.

Final concentrates of osteoblasts and bone but not of serum or control fibroblasts were positive for the inhibition of trypsin degradation of fibrin. Osteoblast final concentrates inhibited trypsin hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester. Osteoblast and bone final concentrates comigrated with Trasylol but were electrophoretically distinct from alpha 1-antiproteinase. Final concentrates of osteoblast and bone extracts did not inhibit tadpole collagenase using the [3H]glycine-labeled diffuse chick collagen fibril assay. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of osteoblast final concentrates after purification using immobilized trypsin affinity chromatography revealed the presence of a major peak that was positive for the inhibition of trypsin. Molecular weight determination by HPLC indicated that the inhibitor(s) range in nominal molecular weight from 4300 to 5100 daltons. The presence of low-molecular-weight serine proteinase inhibitory activity in bone suggests its participation in the regulation of bone resorption through the regulation of enzyme activation of collagenase, and possibly its role in defense against bone matrix enzymatic degradation during tumor cell invasion.", "PMC2896113": "Stools from 1000 travellers returning from the tropics were examined for intestinal parasites. The most frequently isolated intestinal pathogens were Giardia lamblia (5%) and E. histolytica (3.6%).

This finding correlated closely with clinical symptoms and positive serology, while E. histolytica with non-pathogenic zymodeme should not be considered as a cause of diarrhoea.", "PMC1567813": "Allotypes of rabbit Ig provide a useful tool for the study of quantitative expression of alternative allelic forms. In the rabbit, maternal Ig is transmitted to the foetus and protects the immunologically immature newborn during several of the first weeks of life. Induced maternal antibodies directed towards a paternally inherited allotype of the offspring can influence the expression of that allotype drastically. Normal Ig level in heterozygous allotype suppressed animals is provided by increased expression of the alternative allele. On the other hand, allotype suppression in homozygous animals leads to increased expression of non-allelic alternative gene products. We quantitatively analysed the expression of bas, a marker on the kappa 2 light chain isotype of the mutant strain Basilea, in homozygous bas/bas rabbits which had been fostered in utero of b4/b6 mothers producing anti-bas. All of the offspring studied expressed the kappa 2 isotype at a very low level at two months of age, and, in some individuals, bas was hardly expressed after 6 to 12 months. A suppressed rabbit, which was immunized to produce auto-antibodies against bas, continued to do so for at least 2.5 years. The long duration of homozygous bas suppression contrasts with homozygous suppression of other allotypes (CL kappa 1 and VHa) which generally lasts for a much shorter period.", "PMC3029264": "Some physicochemical properties of partially purified hypothalamic material from the spontaneously hypertensive rat, and of plasma from man and the rat, have been characterized using a validated cytochemical bioassay which measures the ability of biological fluids to stimulate fresh guinea-pig kidney glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) after 2 min of exposure to the test substance, as an indication of their ability to inhibit Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) after 4-6 min of exposure. The G6PD-stimulating activity of both hypothalamic extract and plasma is soluble in water and insoluble in chloroform. During electrophoresis the activity from both sites appears in the same fractions and travels considerably further than lysine. After high-pressure liquid chromatography the activity of hypothalamic extract appears in a discreet fraction which does not absorb u.v. light. The activity of both the hypothalamic extract and plasma survives boiling and acid hydrolysis, but is substantially inhibited by prior incubation with digoxin antibody. From ultrafiltration studies, the substance responsible for the ability to stimulate G6PD appears to have a molecular weight of less than 500. The G6PD-stimulating activity of hypothalamic extracts was destroyed by ashing and by base hydrolysis. The ability of plasma of high activity to stimulate G6PD is considerably increased by incubating at 37 degrees C for 15 min and destroyed by incubation for 45 min. It is concluded that these and several other previously noted similarities suggest that the cytochemically assayable Na+/K+-ATPase-inhibiting/G6PD-stimulating activity in the plasma and hypothalamus may be due to the same ouabain-like substance.", "PMC3491828": "Repeated bedside measurements of CBF have been made possible by the recent development of a mobile unit with 10 stationary detectors using the intravenous xenon-133 method. To evaluate this technique, comparative CBF studies at rest and following the application of a cerebral vasodilatory stimulus (acetazolamide, 1 g i.v.) were performed with the mobile equipment and with xenon-133 single-photon emission inhalation tomography in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The CBF level and the flow response to acetazolamide as determined with the two methods were well correlated, although at low flow levels the stationary detectors yielded somewhat lower CBF values than did emission tomography. Considering the side-to-side asymmetry, an excellent correlation was obtained. Using the initial slope index, the stationary detectors revealed quantitatively 83% of the interhemispheric asymmetry and 63% of the asymmetry in the middle cerebral artery territory shown with the tomograph. As illustrated by a case history, the nontomographic CBF unit used in this study may provide reliable and useful information in patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease by performing repeated CBF studies and challenging the cerebral circulation with acetazolamide.", "PMC2140193": "The gene for human high-mobility-group (HMG) chromosomal protein HMG-14 is located in region 21q22.3, a region associated with the pathogenesis of Down syndrome, one of the most prevalent human birth defects. The expression of this gene is analyzed in mouse embryos that are trisomic in chromosome 16 and are considered to be an animal model for Down syndrome. RNA blot-hybridization analysis and detailed analysis of HMG-14 protein levels indicate that mouse trisomy 16 embryos have approximately 1.5 times more HMG-14 mRNA and protein than their normal littermates, suggesting a direct gene dosage effect. The HMG-14 gene may be an additional marker for the Down syndrome. Chromosomal protein HMG-14 is a nucleosomal binding protein that may confer distinct properties to the chromatin structure of transcriptionally active genes and therefore may be a contributing factor in the etiology of the syndrome.", "PMC3629650": "In children with Moyamoya disease, transient ischemic attacks often occur during hyperventilation, and the frequency of attacks usually decreases with advancing age. To elucidate the mechanism of the attacks, the regional cerebral blood flow was measured during rest and/or hyperventilation in children aged 3-16 with Moyamoya disease. Regional cerebral blood flow during rest was significantly higher in younger children with Moyamoya disease, and it progressively decreased with advancing age through childhood. During hyperventilation, regional cerebral blood flow decreased in all the children, although blood flow in younger children was still higher than that in the older children. Nevertheless, transient ischemic attacks were more readily precipitated by hyperventilation in the younger than in the older children. Cerebral metabolic demand is much higher in the first decade of life than in later decades. Therefore, it seems likely that even a moderate reduction in cerebral blood flow can cause metabolic impairment in young children. Such high cerebral metabolic demand may play an important role in the frequent occurrence of transient ischemic attacks in young children with Moyamoya disease.", "PMC3117855": "This study assesses the effect of insurance on charges for dental care. It is hypothesized that dental practices with higher percentages of insured patients will have higher average charges for dental visits, all other things being equal. An econometric model and ordinary least squares analysis are used to test the hypothesis, based on data from the American Dental Association's 1985 Survey of Dental Practice. For the sake of homogeneity, the study is confined to solo general practitioners. Within this group, the model is applied to two practice types categorized by whether or not the practice employed a hygienist. In solo general practices with and without hygienists, a positive association between the prevalence of insureds within a practice and charges for dental care visits is shown. Hypothetical cases are used to demonstrate that an additional 18 percent of insureds within a practice results in a 6 percent increase in the average charge for a dental visit. The analysis uncovers associations between other variables and dental charges. Of particular note is the curvilinear relation between a dentist's years of experience and his or her charges for dental care.", "PMC3631187": "Four patients had either ocular conditions that made the use of a contact lens for retinal photocoagulation undesirable, or optical aberrations of the ocular media that made photocoagulation with a conventional contact lens difficult.

The production of 19-nor was dependent on time and on protein concentration, but was not dependent on the pH of the incubation. 19-Nor was not formed in the absence of protein or when protein had been heat-treated following detergent solubilization. 19-Nor was not further metabolized to any other product upon incubation with the CHAPSO-solubilized proteins. No 19-nor-10-oxo derivative of 1,25(OH)2D3 was formed when 1,25(OH)2D3 was used as substrate in the incubation. Kinetic analysis showed a substrate saturation with an apparent Vmax of about 4.1 pmol/min.mg and S0.5 of approximately 1.3 x 10(-6) M. The production of 19-nor was not restricted to the CHAPSO-soluble protein fraction of kidney mitochondria but was also found in both the CHAPSO-soluble and -insoluble fractions of chick liver mitochondria and CHAPSO-treated bovine serum albumin (BSA). 19-Nor production by detergent-treated BSA also showed saturation kinetics with a similar S0.5 and an apparent Vmax which was about 5-fold higher than that obtained with CHAPSO-solubilized mitochondria. The evidence suggests that the formation of 19-nor is not mediated by a traditional enzyme, but does require protein. A mechanism for the conversion of 25-OH-E3 to 19-nor is proposed, in which the naturally-occurring 5(Z)-25-OH-D3 substrate binds to protein, isomerizes to 5(E)-25-OH-D3 and is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to 5(E)-19-nor via a dioxetane intermediate.", "PMC183833": "To relate repair of lesions in DNA with carcinogenesis, it is necessary to study repair in the intact animal under conditions which will and will not induce cancer. The methods used to study the replications stage of repair in isolated cells are not suitable for use in the intact animal. A method is presented which depends on the fact that during cell replication the nuclei enlarge, and may be separated from nuclei of non-replicating cells by rate zonal centrifugation on a sucrose gradient in a zonal rotor. Thus incorporation of [3H]thymidine as a result of de novo synthesis of DNA in replicating nuclei can be separated from incorporation due to repair synthesis in non-replicating nuclei. Treatment of animals with dimethylnitrosamine or with methyl methanesulphonate produced a \"repair-type\" profile, which contrasted with that given by liver nuclei from untreated animals, or from animals in which DNA synthesis had been reduced by treatment with cycloheximide, a compound which is not known to cause direct damage to DNA.

Six of the patients showed a clinically significant improvement (greater than 40% change) on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) before the nap after all-night sleep deprivation, and the group as a whole showed a significant improvement on the HRSD, the Profile of Mood States, and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale subscale for depression. Naps did not alter mood in the responders, but did improve measured depression on the HRSD in the non-responders. Morning and afternoon naps did not differ significantly in their effects on mood or nap sleep.

The average follow-up period was 13.4 years. The initial symptom was intracranial bleeding in 29 patients (58%) and seizure in 15 patients (30%). Small and deep-seated AVM's were associated with a high incidence of bleeding; however, repeated hemorrhages were not necessarily indicative of a poor prognosis. Children younger than 15 years had a better prognosis than adults. There was no correlation between pregnancy and bleeding. In the hemorrhage group, the incidence of rebleeding was 6.9% in the 1st year after initial rupture, 1.91% per year after 5 years, and 0.92% per year after 15 years.

Accumulation of vascular permeability factor (VPF) activity occurs with increasing duration of tumor incubation in vitro. Expression of this activity is inhibited by incubation of cell cultures with cycloheximide or dexamethasone. This VPF is an acid-stable heat-labile macromolecule that is inactivated by trypsin and pepsin and binds immobilized heparin. Activity is retained by ultrafiltration with 30,000-dalton cut-off microconcentrators. Pretreatment of test animals with systemic dexamethasone prior to intradermal injection of VPF diminishes microvascular permeability. Furthermore, VPF activity is not inhibited by antihistamines. Secretion of VPF may cause the vasogenic brain edema that is frequently associated with malignant primary and metastatic intracerebral tumors. Inhibition by dexamethasone of both VPF expression in tissue culture, and VPF activity at the microvascular level in test animals, is in keeping with the known efficacy of this agent in treating the vasogenic edema associated with brain tumors.", "PMC2138278": "The concentration of plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and the mechanism for its secretion were investigated in 17 preterm infants with respiratory distress. Their mean gestational age was 29 wk and wt 1250 g. The infants were followed during the first week of life by sequential Doppler ultrasound studies. Ductal openness versus closure and amount of ductal flow were correlated with plasma ANF concentrations. In a subset of 10 infants, sequential Doppler color flow mapping was used to quantify the ductal flow. During the first 72 h, plasma ANF was high, 361 pg/mL; it decreased to 96 pg/mL by the end of the 1st wk. The ANF level was significantly higher when the ductus was open than closed (393 versus 123 pg/mL, p less than 0.05). In patients with open ductus and bidirectional foramen ovale shunting (n = 3) ANF was 567 pg/mL and in those with left-to-right shunt 355 pg/mL (n 15, NS). The left atrial size, i.e. the left atrial to aortic root ratio, correlated with the amount of ductal shunting (r = 0.63, p less than 0.01) and with ANF concentration (r = 0.46, p less than 0.02). The correlation of ANF values and the magnitude of left-to-right ductal shunting assessed by color flow mapping was highly significant (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001). In these patients, the elevation of ANF is reflective of ductal flow.", "PMC4924997": "Pea extract contains a factor which improves recovery counts of heat-stressed putrefactive anaerobe spores in a complex medium up to threefold. The factor is heat-stable and nondialyzable. Most of the active principle is found in the precipitate which forms during storage of pea extract at 4 C. The precipitate disperses upon heating, is high in starch content, and retains activity after extraction with organic solvents and water. Treatment of pea extract with alpha-amylase results in complete destruction of the active principle. These observations indicate that starch is the factor in pea extract responsible for increased recovery counts of heat-stressed putrefactive anaerobe spores.", "PMC3985956": "Microsomes from the marine mussel Mytilus edulis possess the enzyme activity that selectively metabolizes primary aromatic amines and not polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

(1971). Various metabolites, viz. lactate, DHAP, glucose, glucose 6-P and fructose 6-P were isolated and degraded following the metabolism of [2-14C]pyruvate and [2-14C]glycerol in order to assess the 14C-distributions imparted by \"pyruvate recycling\" reactions. The labelling of DHAP, lactate, glucose and glucose 6-P showed 14C randomizations consistent with the operation and the quantitative extent of \"pyruvate recycling\". These findings support the proposal that the actions of \"pyruvate recycling\" may account for the failure to find significant levels of 14C isotope at C-1 of glucose 6-P following the metabolism of [4,5,6-14C]- or [6-14C]glucose by L-type pentose pathway metabolism in aerobic intact tissues. \"Pyruvate recycling\" diminishes the measured value of the L-type pentose cycle in intact tissues and qualifies one of the mechanistic predictions of the L-type pentose pathway which was unravelled by tracing its reactions with labelled ribose 5-P and liver enzymes (Horecker et al., 1954; Williams et al., 1978a,b) in vitro. The demonstration of an association of L-type pentose pathway reactions with \"pyruvate recycling\" by way of the common reactions of their triose-P intermediates qualifies the superficial acceptance of the predictions of the L-type pathway in vitro for the distribution of isotopic labels by aerobic tissues in vivo.", "PMC2447751": "The high antibacterial activity of nalidixic acid against Escherichia coli, cultivated in raw and pasteurized milk has been shown.

The incorporation of strontium metal into the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) crystals located both in the inner ear and in the endolymphatic sac was studied by x-ray microanalysis (XMA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the inner ear, strontium was not recognized except for traces in a few crystals. When observed by SEM, these crystals had a faceted body and two pointed ends with rather smooth surfaces. However, in the endolymphatic sac, which greatly expands into the spinal canal, strontium was clearly present at every surface of all crystals. Careful examinations by point and line XMA revealed that strontium x-ray counts were highest at the pointed ends and decreased sharply and then gradually toward the equator of the crystals. SEM observations revealed that the crystals in the endolymphatic sac always had rough and irregular surfaces regardless of their shapes and sizes. Calcium was always found in crystals of both organs. Except for calcium and strontium, other elements including sodium and heavier elements were negligible in XMA. These findings suggest that strontium is incorporated into the crystals only in the endolymphatic sac, and the rough-surfaced covering of these crystals reflects newly deposited strontium salt. It seems to indicate that these crystals grow predominantly by accretion.", "PMC3506601": "To evaluate the prognostic value of the left ventricular response to isoproterenol infusion in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 25 patients, 17 men and eight women, were studied. According to responses of left ventricular function to isoproterenol (0.02 microgram/kg/min), the patients were classified in two groups: the normal response group, in which fractional shortening increased by more than 10% (n = 10); and the low response group, in which fractional shortening increased by 10% or less (n = 15). A follow-up spanning four to 40 months with an average of 21 months disclosed that six patients died, two deteriorated, and six had no change in the low response group, while seven patients were improved, three stabilized, and no one deteriorated or died in the normal response group. There was a difference in the clinical courses of the two groups. Thus, the left ventricular response to isoproterenol proved useful in predicting the course of DCM.", "PMC3856598": "Inflammation occurring at the attachment of the masseter muscle to the zygomatic arch--tenomyositis--must be distinguished from the more common disorders occurring in the rest of the muscle. Anti-inflammatory treatment has been effective in the treatment of tenomyositis. The cases presented illustrate the effectiveness of this type of treatment.", "PMC4085350": "The design and interpretation of clinical trials in clinical pharmacology must avoid certain pitfalls to be useful in guiding drug therapy decisions. Here, we discuss one important problem in clinical trial design, the problem of regression to the mean. Because certain disease states tend to wax and wane in severity and because patients tend to present for treatment when disease activity is high, the expected course of the disease is improvement. Therefore, any treatment begun will appear to lessen disease activity. We give four examples of diseases where improper and inadequate recommendations for drug therapy have been made based on clinical trials that ignored the problem of regression to the mean: vasospastic angina, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic congestive heart failure, and renal stones. Studies of drug therapy in diseases such as these should be conducted with concurrent placebo controls rather than having each patient serve as his own control.", "PMC2979765": "Tumor cells inoculated subcutaneously into various regions of the trunk of dogs showed differences in growth for prolonged time periods. However, consistent antero-posterior gradient tumor growth patterns previously reported by other investigators in mouse tumor systems were not observed. The regional variance in tumor growth was not great enough to overcome the dose-response growth relationship in the dogs inoculated with doubling doses of tumor cells.", "PMC2139827": "Etozolin is a new diuretic with hypotensive properties. The above research was aimed to evaluating the effects of etozolin, captopril and their combination in a group of 30 patients with essential hypertension; age range 42-74 years, average 76.6. Patients were subdivided into two groups for a controlled cross-over trial. Group I was treated for 4 weeks with daily etozolin doses of 200 mg, and, after a period of withdrawal until basal values were restored, for a further 4-week period with captopril, 25 mg 3 times daily. Group II had the same treatments in the opposite order. After this cross-over experiment, all patients were treated for 16 weeks with both drugs in combination at the same dosage. Treatment with etozolin led to a reduction of arterial blood pressure from 187/112 +/- 10/4 mmHg to 167/99 +/- 7/6 mmHg; for captopril the corresponding figures were from 186/112 +/- 11.5 mmHg to 163/98 +/- 7.4 mmHg and for the combination from 188/112 +/- 10/5 mmHg to 154/86 +/- 6/5 mmHg. These findings confirmed the efficacy of etozolin and captopril alone; the combination of the two drugs led to a significantly more marked reduction of pressure values compared to monotherapy and neutralized such biochemical changes as had been observed after administration of the two drugs alone. Tolerance was excellent for all treatment schedules used.", "PMC2659576": "We examined the mechanical behavior of a bronchopleural fistula created by sectioning a small subpleural bronchus in seven anesthetized lambs. The pressure across the fistula was measured as the difference between the pressure recorded by a retrograde bronchial catheter inserted in the vicinity of the fistula and the outflow pressure at the fistula exit. The effective resistance of the fistula (Rf) was computed by dividing this pressure difference by the gas flow through the fistula measured at the outlet of an intrapleural tube adjacent to the fistula. Rf increased by 114 +/- 25% (SE) when we inflated the lungs in a stepwise manner from a tracheal pressure of 2-20 cmH2O. Rf also increased when inflation pressure varied continuously; this increase, however, was less evident when we decreased the inflation time from 1.0 to 0.2 s. The relationship between Rf and lung volume was similar during the stepwise inflations and deflations but showed marked hysteresis during the continuous inflation-deflation maneuvers, when Rf was greater during deflation than inflation. Our results suggest that the fistula behaves as a compliant pathway whose relevant transmural pressure is the transmural pressure at or near the fistula's exit. We attribute the increase in Rf during inflation to decreases in transmural pressure caused by convective and dissipative losses inside the fistula and by the stress applied by the chest wall on the outer surface of the fistula.", "PMC3105232": "The relation of ciliary activity to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was studied with a photoelectric method on rabbit sinus mucosa in vitro. A dose-response relationship was found, where by ciliary activity was impaired at pCO2 above 5 kPa. The effect of elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide on ciliary activity in secretory otitis media and sinusitis is discussed.", "PMC3006345": "The turnover of phosphate residues in simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (large T) was determined by pulse-chase labeling with 32Pi and subsequent two-dimensional peptide mapping. Three groups of phosphorylation sites with respect to metabolic stability were distinguished with half-lives of about 8, 3 to 5, or 2 hr, respectively. Sites phosphorylated in the cytoplasm were relatively stable, whereas most of the sites phosphorylated in the nucleus exhibited high turnover rates. We suggest that sites with low turnover represent permanent modifications whereas sites with high turnover might contribute to the dynamic properties of large T, e.g., its interaction with the viral genome. When the phosphate turnover in various subclasses of large T was compared the monomeric and oligomeric forms showed no significant differences. Likewise, the DNA-binding and nonbinding fractions exhibited similar phosphate turnover. However, in the DNA-binding fraction the 3H label decreased faster than the 32P label indicating that large T in this fraction had been replaced by newly synthesized molecules which were not labeled with 3H but nevertheless with 32P. this latter result suggests that a certain degree of phosphorylation might be required for DNA binding.", "PMC2924050": "Resonance artifacts introduced by the catheter-manometer system are removed from the direct radial artery pressure using a three-step algorithm. First, the fast-flush method is used to identify the natural frequency and damping coefficient of the monitoring system by digitizing and analyzing the pressure transient created by the flush. Second, resistor, capacitor, and inductor values are found for an RLC second-order model of the catheter-manometer system in use. Third, the algorithm predicts the undistorted radial artery pressure, removing the resonance artifacts by inverse-filtering the digitized monitored pressure waveform using the RLC circuit derived previously. The algorithm was implemented using a personal computer, but it could also be used without the computer by incorporating an analog-to-digital convertor and a microprocessor in the hemodynamic monitor.", "PMC3325944": "The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of chloroiodic complex compound with non-ionic surface active substances such as Polchlor K on the kinetics of dying, activity of bacterial dehydrogenases and glucosidases as well as ultrastructure of bacterial cells on the example of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The evaluation of the kinetics of bacteria dying under the preparation activity revealed higher activity against E. coli than S. aureus. It was found that the preparation in bactericidal concentrations decreased significantly dehydrogenase activity in the examined microorganisms and also affects the changes in their ultrastructure. The cell dying was mainly due to structure-functional lesions in the cytoplasmic membrane--initially inactivation of respiratory enzymes localized inside the cytoplasmic membrane and furthermore its structural lesion.", "PMC3339576": "Healthy follicles with 2-24 oocytes were observed in adult rabbit ovaries during all phases of folliculogenesis from primary to preovulatory follicles. Most follicles contained 2-3 oocytes which developed according to their topographical situation in the follicle. The central oocyte in a normal topographical situation has an almost normal growth and development up to metaphase II and cumulus expansion. The peripheral oocytes grow more slowly: most do not attain the normal size or resume meiosis and remain surrounded by ordinary granulosa cells. When the number of oocytes is higher than 3, the peripheral oocytes develop even more slowly, as do the central ones. It demonstrates the necessity for the oocyte to occupy a certain position inside the follicle and to reach a size which allows resumption of meiosis; the cumulus responds only to oocytes of normal size and position. We suggest that, despite the relative frequency of binovular follicles, fertilization of two oocytes originating from one follicle is unlikely.", "PMC2363144": "Psoriasis is an inflammatory condition of the skin which affects about 2% of the population. Several new treatment modalities have been introduced in recent years. This review considers the mode of action of various forms of treatment, side effects and therapeutic results that have been observed. Etretinate is a synthetic vitamin A analogue. It works alone, or even better in combination with psoralen plus ultraviolet light A (PUVA) or ultraviolet light B (UVB). Cyclosporin is still on trial, but seems to be effective in small doses and can be considered as an alternative in cases of psoriasis that are resistant to other therapies. The interest in dietary measures for psoriasis has been revived after some studies have suggested that dietary supplements of fish oil, a low-fat diet, can improve the condition. Now that n-3-fatty acids are available in capsule form it should be possible to prescribe a diet that is rich enough in fish oils.", "PMC3551866": "The detection of group B streptococcal soluble antigens was performed in 139 newborn infants suspected of infection. A qualitative agglutination test of sensitized latex particles (Wellcogen Strep B) was performed in the urine. The diagnosis of group B streptococcal infection was assessed by retrospective analysis of patient files using previously defined criteria. The correlation between the agglutination test result and the presence or absence of streptococcal infection was statistically significant; the test had a sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 97%, positive predictive value of 76% and negative predictive value of 98%. This study confirms the interest of such a test in the early diagnosis of group B streptococcal infection in infants.", "PMC2362312": "Several different hepatic parenchymal lesions, including chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, have been increasingly reported in children with schistosomal hepatic fibrosis (SHF) despite the known mesenchymal nature of the disease. The prevalence of persistent hepatitis (B) surface (HBs) antigenaemia and some hepatic functions have been determined in 52 children with SHF as well as in 100 age-matched healthy children. High prevalence of chronic HBs antigenaemia (58 per cent) has been demonstrated in children with SHF, but only in 2 per cent of the normal children. This denotes that children with SHF represent a dangerous reservoir for hepatitis B infection to the community. Serum alanine transferase (ALT) was higher than normal in 58 per cent of HBS seropositive patients and in none of the seronegative patients. This points to the risk of continual hepatic parenchymal injury to the HBs seropositive patients with schistosomiasis.", "PMC2225778": "The CPU time required to complete a cycle of restrained least-squares refinement of a protein structure from X-ray crystallographic data using the FORTRAN codes PROTIN and PROLSQ are reported for 48 different processors, ranging from single-user workstations to supercomputers.

Successful masking was observed in 72% of the former and 70% of the latter. There was no remarkable difference between the two maskers regarding the acceptability and intensity. The duration of residual inhibition, however, was smaller in the masker not covering the tinnitus frequency. The masking sound tested could be useful as an alternative when the conventional one is not accepted.", "PMC3770052": "One batch of lyophilized calf uterine cytosol was analyzed for estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PgR, respectively) content by 12 members of the EORTC Receptor Group on three different occasions over a total study period of 1 yr: One vial was included with each of 20 consecutive batches of routine tumor analyses between December 1983 and May 1984. Two vials were simultaneously assayed between July and August 1984 (within-run variation). One vial was analyzed at the end of 1984 (November-December). The overall mean ER and PgR values did not change systematically over the total study period of 1 yr. Within the various laboratories, the between-run variations of both ER and PgR assays were considerable and differed from one institution to another (7-26%). For both ER and PgR measurements the average within-run (n = 2) and between-run (n = 20) coefficients of variation were similar (8-9% and 16-17%, respectively). Comparison of the results from multiple sequential assays (c.v. = 12.9%) with those from single assays (c.v. = 21.2%) showed that about 60% of the between-laboratory variance in ER could be explained on the basis of the between-run variance. With regard to PgR analysis, however, the between-laboratory variance decreased only 25%. Standardized use of one type of protein assay (Coomassie brilliant blue) and a standard protein solution (human serum albumin) has decreased the between-laboratory variation of the protein analysis results to less than 15%.", "PMC3439672": "The authors report a case of hypertonia, the clinical and electrophysiological features of which were identical to those of the Stiff-man syndrome first described by Moersch and Woltman in 1956. This and the five other previously reported cases can be attributed to encephalomyelitis of the anterior horns of the spinal cord. All of these cases had severe but partial involvement of the anterior horns and the probable physiopathological mechanism of the resulting contractures was elective destruction of the small inhibitory neurones. In the present case, the association of a limbic encephalitis and secondary exteriorization of a carcinoma of the pharynx, strongly suggested a paraneoplasic encephalomyelitis. This is the first report indicating an association between the Stiff man syndrome and a paraneoplastic syndrome. Another point of interest was the spectacular response of the hypertonia to steroid therapy suggesting a central neuropharmacological effect quite apart from the non specific anti-inflammatory action on the encephalomyelitis.", "PMC3475010": "Liquid membrane reactors are well known for metal extraction. This technology may also be applied to the immobilization of enzymes in enzyme emulsions. The use of liquid membrane reactors for enzymatic bioconversions has several advantages in comparison to solid membrane reactors and conventional immobilization techniques: there is no membrane fouling, enzyme emulsions can be used in cell-free fermentation broths, in complex mixtures the membrane can preselect the desired substrate for enzymatic reaction, and substances that might decrease the enzyme activity can be excluded. The separation effect is not based on differences in molecular weight but on the chemical behavior of the substances to be separated. Thus, it is not necessary to use cofactors with increased molecular weight for enzymatic reactions, since the coenzyme cannot permeate the liquid membrane. The three systems presented here indicate that enzyme systems can be easily immobilized in liquid surfactant membrane emulsions and there is a broad field of application for enzyme emulsions.", "PMC2203126": "In the 70s the concept burn-out appeared in psychological literature on the helping professions. The concept has since then been ascribed several meanings, and critical voices have been raised against the lack of clarity and consensus in the definitions. The aim of this article was to critically examine the thinking on the concept of burn-out. The helping professionals--nurses, welfare officers, psychologists, medical doctors, etc.--have expanded rapidly since the 60s. It is stated that the issues on which burn-out researchers focus deserve the attention of social scientists in general. The major limitation in the literature on burn-out is that there is little analysis of the role of society and social conditions in producing the phenomenon. It is suggested that sociological analyses may have a contribution to make here.", "PMC2784139": "We have studied the effect of methotrexate in murine acute graft vs host (GvH) disease at concentrations analogous to those used in human rheumatoid arthritis. The GvH reaction was induced by i.v. injection of parental spleen cells into a normal F1 recipient. The acute suppression of T cell function in GvH mice was prevented by methotrexate given orally for 10 days at 1.0 or 0.5 mg/kg but not at 0.25 mg/kg. T cell mitogen response and IL-2 secretion that were inhibited in GvH mice were restored by methotrexate. Protection from immunosuppression in drug-treated GvH mice lasted at least 3 wk after drug dosing was stopped. The mechanism of the protective effect appears to be a preferential inhibition of donor and host Lyt-2+ Ts cell proliferation. In mixing experiments we found that methotrexate inhibited Ts function in GvH mice. By dual fluorescence labeling we showed that the engraftment of donor Lyt-2+ cells was prevented by drug treatment. This was not true of donor L3T4+ cells which were clearly present in the spleens of GvH mice after methotrexate treatment. These donor L3T4 cells were functional in that they induced the production of anti-DNA autoantibodies in the methotrexate-treated GvH mice.", "PMC2249927": "We examined the effects of unilateral nephrectomy (UNx) and repetitive pregnancies (RP) on glomerular damage and blood pressure in mice. Four groups of 10 female mice, 7 weeks old, underwent sham nephrectomy (SV) alone, sham nephrectomy and six pregnancies (SP), right nephrectomy alone (NV) and right nephrectomy followed by six repetitive pregnancies (NP). UNx resulted in a significant elevation of serum creatinine up to 11 weeks. In all animals pregnancy was associated with a temporary decrease in serum creatinine except at termination of the 6th pregnancy in group NP. UNx and RP did not result in an increase in protein excretion. UNx in both virgin and pregnant mice resulted in blood pressure elevation without any renal histological abnormalities by the end of the 6th pregnancy. We conclude that at least up to the end of the 3rd pregnancy, gestation was associated with augmentation in function of a single kidney. This effect was lost by the end of the 6th pregnancy. Multiple repetitive pregnancies in uninephrectomized animals entailed renal functional deterioration and a rise in blood pressure without renal histological abnormalities on light microscopy.", "PMC2582947": "Meibomian gland carcinoma of the eyelid is a common neoplasm which clinically simulates a benign condition of chalazion. Although growing slowly, metastasis to regional lymph nodes is frequent, at a rate of 17-28% in this country.

The identification of GABA receptors as putative target sites for a variety of insecticidal agents has contributed to the resurgence of interest in amino acid receptors of insects and other invertebrates. In this review, James Rauh and colleagues describe the properties of GABA receptors of insects and detail some striking pharmacological differences between the well-characterized GABA receptors of vertebrates and those of insects and other invertebrate organisms. A detailed understanding of invertebrate receptor pharmacology will be increasingly important for defining the mode of action of numerous modern pesticides.", "PMC3720730": "The human U1 and U2 snRNA genes lack an obvious TATA box, but are extremely powerful RNA polymerase II transcription units capable of accurately initiating at least one transcript per gene every 2-4 s. We have investigated the location of cis-acting regulatory elements within the flanking sequences of human U2 and U1 genes. By introducing marked human U2 genes into HeLa cells on SV40- and pUC13-based vectors, we found that transient expression of the marked U2 gene did not require the SV40 enhancer. The U2 promoter element responsible for SV40 enhancer-independent U2 expression was localized within the 5'-flanking sequence of the gene, and shown to stimulate transcription from the U2 basal promoter in an orientation- and position-independent fashion. In addition, the U2 element could be functionally replaced by either the SV40 enhancer or by distal sequences from the human U1 promoter. We conclude that the human U2 and U1 genes contain functionally equivalent enhancer elements. Moreover, since the human U2 enhancer sequences resemble the Xenopus U2 enhancer-like element, enhancers appear to be a general feature of vertebrate snRNA promoter structure.", "PMC3954497": "Myocardial distribution of the retrograde flow through the coronary sinus in the canine heart was evaluated by observing the corrosion casts of the myocardial vessels after coronary sinus injection of a low-viscosity resin, Mercox, a compound that passes through capillaries. The apex and the left ventricular free wall were well perfused at the microvascular level, even in the presence of complete left main coronary artery occlusion, whereas the right ventricular free wall was not perfused effectively at this level in any heart. Although there was considerable variation in the perfusion of the ventricular septum from heart to heart, the entire septum was not perfused in some of the hearts. We considered this poor perfusion of the septum to be due to the presence of well-developed thebesian veins in the septum. Retrograde coronary sinus perfusion of cardioplegic solution may be a valuable alternative to protect the left ventricular free wall, especially in cases of critical coronary artery stenosis or occlusion. However, antegrade perfusion should be used also, whenever possible, for adequate protection of the septum and the right ventricular free wall.", "PMC3542610": "The ideal neuromuscular blocking drug for dental and other outpatient procedures would be nondepolarizing (therefore reversible), highly potent, have a rapid onset and short duration of action, be highly specific for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, be eliminated independently of renal or hepatic metabolism, and have minimal side effects such as tachycardia and histamine release. The newer neuromuscular blocking drugs vecuronium and atracurium approach this ideal much more closely than the older drugs curare, metocurine, and gallamine. Aside from considerations of slightly higher cost, the neuromuscular blocking agents of choice remain succinylcholine for rapid, short-lived paralysis, vecuronium and atracurium for relaxation of 15- to 60-minute duration and when cardiovascular stability is vital, and pancuronium for longer surgical procedures. Vecuronium and atracurium have achieved and will continue to achieve predominance in the anesthetic management of the short-procedure patient.", "PMC2957428": "We have previously identified two BCGF II-like factors which can be distinguished by their differential reactivity in several murine BCGF II assays. Prototype sources of these two factors are a partially purified preparation derived from PHA-P-stimulated human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (designated human BCGF), and supernatant from antigen-stimulated D10.G4.1 murine T cells (designated D10 sup). Extending the characterization of these two factors, we show here that human BCGF and D10 sup both cause tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation and IgM secretion by T cell-depleted, in vivo-activated, large murine B cells. In contrast, only the human BCGF consistently induced proliferation and IgM secretion by T cell-depleted, small murine B cells. When simultaneously added to cultures, D10 sup and human BCGF synergized to produce optimal IgM secretion by large murine B cells and murine BCL1 B lymphoma cells. The same factors were tested in an IgM-specific plaque assay, and a similar synergistic response was observed for the large B cells, but not for the BCL1 cells. The combination of factors also produced maximal [3H]TdR incorporation by large murine B cells. In contrast, the addition of human BCGF totally abrogated D10 sup-induced BCL1 proliferation. Together, these data suggest that the synergies observed in IgM secretion result from an increased production of plaque-forming cells (PFC) in cultures of large B cells and an increase in IgM production per responding cell in BCL1 cells. Kinetic analysis of the time of action of the two BCGF II-like lymphokines in the induction of the PFC response by large B cells indicated that human BCGF was required within the first 24 hr of a 4-day culture period, while D10 sup could be added as late as the final 15 hr without significant diminution of the response. In summary, these data provide further support for the existence of two distinct B cell stimulatory factors which cause growth and differentiation of activated B cells, and indicate that these two factors synergize to produce optimal Ig secretion. For ease of discussion, the activity in the human BCGF preparation is referred to as BCGF IIA, and the activity in D10 sup is referred to as BCGF IIB.", "PMC2553011": "Thrombin, a blood coagulation factor, has been shown to be a very effective in vitro bone resorbing agent whose mechanism of action on osteoblastic cells remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the effects of highly purified human thrombin on Saos-2 and G292 cells, two human osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell lines, were investigated. Thrombin (0.6-16 U/ml) caused a significant, dose-dependent increase in osteoblastic cell proliferation. Thrombin also elicited a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic calcium concentration in both Saos-2 and G292 cells (maximal increases were 38% and 200% over baseline, respectively). Addition of thrombin to the osteoblast-like cells resulted in significant time- and dose-dependent changes in phosphoinositide levels: the percentage of inositol monophosphate levels were decreased, whereas the percentage of inositol bisphosphate, inositol trisphosphate and inositol tetrakisphosphate levels were increased. The relative magnitude of the changes in phosphoinositide levels was similar to the changes in cytosolic calcium concentration. These results suggest that thrombin's mechanism of action on bone cells may involve increases in cytosolic calcium levels and in phosphoinositide metabolism.", "PMC2233774": "Adenomatoide tumor of uterine is reported on the basis of study of three surgical preparations.

Several sulfhydryl-modifying reagents viz. p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (PCMBS), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), dithio-bis(5-nitropyridine) (DTNP), bromosuccinimide and HgCl2 inhibited uptake of bile acids in a concentration-dependent manner. PCMBS was the most effective inhibitor in the uptake of taurocholate, while NEM is preferentially blocking the cholate uptake. PCMBS inhibited both the sodium- dependent and the sodium-independent bile acid uptake. Two different moieties of SH-groups seemed to be important for bile acid transport. One group was susceptible to DTNP and NEM, whereas PCMBS was able to block another type of SH-groups in addition. Cell viability was altered by SH-blockers, except by PCMBS. Efflux studies with 86Rb+ demonstrated that the transmembrane potential of hepatocytes was less effected by 100 microM PCMBS in contrast to 100 microM HgCl2. Efflux of tetra[3H]phenylphosphonium and of [3H]aflatoxin in PCMBS-treated hepatocytes documented membrane integrity during at least 10 min. PCMBS did not reduce cellular ATP levels significantly (minus 7%) nor did it markedly increase the amount of the Trypan-blue stained hepatocytes (plus 8.5%). The blocking effect of PCMBS was immediate and was completely reversed by the addition of 500 microM dithiothreitol (DTT), indicating a specific interaction with sulfhydryl-groups. This antagonizing effect of DTT depends on the concentration and exposure time of PCMBS. Six other thiols viz. 2-mercaptoethanol, 1,2-dimercaptoethane, 1,4-dimercaptobutane, 1,6-dimercaptohexane, L-cysteine and L-glutathione were less effective. The results suggest that free SH-groups on the outer surface of hepatocytes play an important role in the uptake process for conjugated and unconjugated bile acids.", "PMC3501460": "This study of 200 Uruguayans between 0 and 86 years old was designed to determine the prevalence of lactose malabsorption. Lactose intolerance is defined as a clinical syndrome of abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, and bloating after the ingestion of a standard lactose tolerance test dose (2 g of lactose per kilogram of body weight or 50 g/m2 of body surface area, maximum 50 g in a 20% water solution). Lactose malabsorption refers to the state in which dietary lactose remains unhydrolyzed and subsequently unabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; symptoms may or may not result from lactose malabsorption. The technique of breath hydrogen (H2) was used after ingestion of 2 g/kg body weight to a maximum of 50 g in a 20% solution. There was no lactose malabsorption in children younger than 5 years old. The prevalence increases progressively after the age of 5, and in adolescence the percentage of malabsorption is similar to that in adults, who show 65% lactose malabsorption, with 25% asymptomatic and 40% intolerant. In 109 white adults, the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is 63%, with 24% asymptomatic and 39% intolerant. In 11 black adults, lactose malabsorption is 82%, with 27% asymptomatic and 55% intolerant. The difference between white and black adults is statistically significant (p less than 0.05).

Basal prolactin concentrations as well as the prolactin response to TRH were significantly (p less than 0.05) increased after flunarizine treatment. Flunarizine had no effect on the folliclestimulating and luteinising hormone response to GnRH stimulation, growth hormone response to arginine infusion or thyrotrophin response to TRH stimulation.

There were eight male and six female patients. Their average age was 61 years. The hip was involved in 14 joints (femoral component 11 times, acetabulum 7, and greater trochanter once). One patient presented with granulomatous pseudotumors of the knee. The principal findings included increasing pain and radiographic evidence of loosening occurring on average 2.7 years following the implant. This was followed by a characteristic and gradually developing radiographic pattern of discrete rounded lucencies. These developed into large ovoid lytic areas, destroying both methylmethacrylate and bone. Histologically, the appearances were characterized by histiocytic infiltration and the presence of multiple foreign body giant cells. Foreign material was identified in 9 of 11 cases.

The hemodynamic changes during head-up tilt were not different between the three groups. The symptomatic MVP patients showed a lower rise in diastolic blood pressure (14.3 +/- 6.4%) than the controls (22.9 +/- 9.6%) (p less than 0.05) during isometric exercise. In view of the fact that the neurohumoral responses to both tests were the same for all groups, we cannot support the suggestions from other studies that MVP patients have an impaired or enhanced sympathetic tone. Moreover, since there were no differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic MVP patients it is doubtful whether the complaints of symptomatic MVP patients are related to a high sympathetic neural activity.", "PMC3747158": "Postoperative recurrence and death rates of 54 cases of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma were analyzed. The rates of recurrence of 18 widely resected cases during 1979 and 1981 and 36 patients undergoing conventional surgery during 1965 and 1978 were 22.2% and 50%, respectively. The difference between the figures was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The death rates of the two groups were 5.6% and 41.7%, respectively.

In the two emergency wards a total of 281 victims of deliberate violence were observed corresponding to a rate of approximately 0.2/1000 per year in a mainly middle income area of the metropolis Buenos Aires, the catchment region of Hospital Fernandez, and 0.6/1000 per year in a mainly low income area of Buenos Aires, the catchment region of Hospital Pinero. Men aged 20-24 years and 40-49 years were found to be the most frequent victims of deliberate violence, 13% and 11%, respectively. Elderly women greater than or equal to 60 years of age were rarely found to be victims of deliberate violence (2%). Skilled and unskilled male workers were over-represented as victims of violence. Sixty-four percent of the victims were men and 29% women, 6% were boys and 0.7% girls less than or equal to 14 years of age. Twenty-one percent of the male victims and 5% of the female victims were alcohol intoxicated when arriving in the emergency ward. The incidents took place in restaurants or in the vicinity of restaurants for only 7% of the male victims, while 55% of male victims and 34% of female victims had been injured in the street, most often by non-acquainted men. Fifty-eight percent of the female victims had been subject to deliberate violence at home, in the majority of the cases beaten by their spouse. Twelve percent of the male victims and 8% of the female victims were estimated to be under the influence of drugs. The incidence of deliberate violence seems to be lower in Argentina than in Denmark. However, serious lesions appear to be considerably more frequent in male Argentinian victims compared to male Danish victims, maybe because the practice of seeking medical assistance is different in the two countries. The pattern of deliberate violence appears to be associated with socio-economic and cultural factors. Influence of alcohol does not appear to play a role that is comparable to the situation observed in Denmark. A considerably larger percentage of victims in Argentina than in Denmark had been injured in the street.", "PMC3325267": "State and prospects of the drug cancer therapy are examined in the light of achievements of modern molecular oncology.

The variations of the action potential parameters (amplitude and velocity) are traced also. The simulation of the conduction along the normal fiber is based on the Frankenhaeuser and Huxley (1964) and Goldman and Albus (1968) equations, while the demyelination is considered to be an elongation of the nodes of Ranvier. The axonal membrane reorganization is achieved by means of potassium channel blocking and increase of the sodium-channel permeability. It is shown that potassium channels block decreases membrane excitability for the myelinated and demyelinated fibres in the cases of initial and paired stimulation. With increasing sodium-channel permeability on the background of the blocked potassium channels, the membrane excitability is increased. For the fibres with a reorganized membrane, a supernormality of the membrane excitability is obtained, the latter remaining unrecovered during the 30 ms cycle under investigation. The supernormality of the excitability grows from the demyelinated fibre without reorganized membrane to the demyelinated fibre with reorganized one. For short interstimulus intervals, the second action potential propagates along the fibres with a reduced velocity and a decreased amplitude. No supernormality of the potential parameters (amplitude, velocity) is observed during the cycle up to 30 ms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2064331": "The in vitro antimetabolic effect of a newly synthesized platinum antineoplastic agent, DWA2114R, on 72 fresh human tumors was compared with that of cis-platinum (CDDP). DWA2114R is reported to have a lower nephrotoxicity than CDDP, but is as strong an inhibitor of DNA synthesis as CDDP. In vitro IC50 was assessed in 10 tumors; the IC50 of DWA2114R ranged between 9.2 and 107 microM (mean +/- S.D., 45.9 +/- 36.6) and that of CDDP ranged between 0.9 and 40 microM (18.3 +/- 15.1). DWA2114R had an antitumor spectrum similar to that of CDDP. Primary esophageal and pancreatic cancers were sensitive to DWA2114R, and cells separated from malignant effusion or metastatic lymph nodes were more sensitive than those from primary lesions. Nude mice were transplanted with 3 kinds of human tumor xenografts (esophageal, pancreatic and bile duct cancer lines), and were then treated with CDDP or DWA2114R at 4 times the clinical doses. CDDP significantly inhibited the growth of all the 3 lines, and DWA2114R inhibited the growth of 2 of the lines. The effect of DWA2114R on body weight was smaller than that of CDDP. These results suggest that DWA2114R may be less potent than CDDP but may be useful as a new platinum antineoplastic agent with lower grade of side effects than CDDP.", "PMC1781564": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made using a \"Narkograph\", which performs an automatic on-line interpretation of electroencephalographic data obtained during anesthesia. The EEG was classified into one of 13 stages from A (awake) to F (very deep narcosis). In 20 of roughly 600 patients EEG changes were observed that could not be explained by the effects of anesthetics. Slowing of the EEG occurred during the transition from controlled to spontaneous ventilation and disappeared after minute ventilation increased. The alterations seen during hypoventilation were similar to the effects of hypoxia described in the literature. During the slowing in the rough EEG, waves appeared that were very regularly formed and corresponded to sharp peaks in the power spectrum. These features are rather atypical of the effects of anesthetics such as thiopental, propofol, halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane and were not observed when patients went back to sleep after extubation. If depth of anesthesia is monitored by EEG recording, clinical circumstances should be taken into account because conditions such as hypoxia may cause alterations of the EEG that bear a resemblance to the effects of anesthetics.", "PMC2180486": "Collagens collected from the test (the external hard covering of invertebrates) of the sea urchin, Asthenosoma ijimai, were characterized biochemically and immunologically. The amino-acid composition was typical of that of mammalian collagens. Crystals of segment-long-spacing showed that the molecules of sea urchin collagen were 300 nm long. Selective salt precipitation revealed that the collagen has the same solubility characteristics as type I collagen. The collagen was denatured at 23.1 degrees C. Anti-sea urchin collagen antisera were immunologically cross-reacted with collagens of the same species and the starfish Asterina pectinifera. However, the antisera showed no or slight responses to collagens of bovine type I, II, III, IV and V. The collagen molecules contained four alpha-chains, named alpha 1(SU), alpha 2(SU), alpha 3(SU) and alpha 4(SU), respectively. All of the four alpha-chains were eluted in the same fraction on gel filtration chromatography. Chains of alpha 1(SU) and alpha 2(SU) were extracted earlier than alpha 3(SU) and alpha 4(SU) during pepsin digestion. Other biochemical and immunological analyses clearly demonstrated that test of sea urchins contains two genetically different, but biochemically similar, species of collagens, one of which is composed of alpha 1(SU) and alpha 2(SU) chains, and the other of alpha 3(SU) and alpha 4(SU).", "PMC1420323": "This paper describes the effect of an in-vitro poly(ADP-ribose) turnover system on the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of chromatin. Both poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and poly(ADP-ribose)glycohydrolase were highly purified and used in 4 different turnover systems: non-turnover, slow, medium and fast turnover. These turnover systems were designed to reflect possible turnover conditions in intact cells. The major protein acceptors for poly(ADP-ribose) are histones and the polymerase itself, a process referred to as automodification. The level of poly(ADP-ribose) modification of polymerase, histone H1 and core histones has been measured. The size of the polymer for each of the 3 groups of acceptor proteins has been determined by gel electrophoresis. After many turnover cycles at medium and fast turnover, the histones (H1 and core) become the main poly(ADP-ribose) acceptor proteins. The rate at which steady-state polymer levels are reached and the total accumulation of polymer in a given turnover system are both inversely proportional to the amount of glycohydrolase present. Furthermore, increasing amounts of glycohydrolase in the turnover systems reduces average polymer size. The polymer synthesized in the medium and fast turnover systems is degraded by glycohydrolase in a biphasic fashion and in these systems the half-life of polymer agreed with results found in intact cells. Our results show that the relative levels of polymerase and glycohydrolase activities can regulate the proportional poly(ADP-ribose) distribution on chromatin-associated acceptor proteins during steady-state turnover conditions. The patterns of modification of polymerase and histones under turnover conditions agree with in vivo observations.", "PMC3267300": "Early changes of the activity of enzymes such as creatine kinase in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum are often investigated after head injuries to assess the extent of brain damage and establish a reliable prognosis. The purpose of the present study was to determine levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme CK-BB in the CSF of rats after experimental head injuries. External head injuries of different severity were inflicted on rats, immediately after which CSF was collected for isoenzyme activity determination. It was found that the levels of CK-BB were significantly elevated immediately after the head injury and that the greater the degree of external cranial injury inflicted, the higher the isoenzyme activity was. The results seem to provide evidence that CK-BB activity is an early indicator of brain damage and that its level may reflect the extent of cerebral damage involved.", "PMC2363739": "The varus-valgus stability of 20 knees with unicompartmental osteoarthritis was studied in vivo at the time of total knee replacement.

A panel of antibodies, directed against neuron-specific enolase, S-100 protein, synaptophysin, neurofilament protein, and nerve growth factor receptor, was utilized to evaluate the distribution of nerve fibers in paraffin-embedded tissue. Anti-synaptophysin and anti-nerve growth factor receptor highlighted small, arborizing nerve fibers in the mucosa, not apparent in the routinely stained sections. Intense staining of these fibers was observed in regional enteritis with antinerve growth factor receptor.

In order to study the effects of two new alpha-glucosidase inhibitors with long (BAYo1248) and short (BAYm1099) duration of action on glycaemic control, seventeen insulin-dependent diabetics were connected to the Biostator for 24 h and postprandial hyperglycaemia, insulin requirements and breath H2 concentrations were assessed under three conditions: (a) before administration of any alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (control experiments), (b) after administration of BAYo1248 (40 mg before breakfast, nine patients) or BAYm1099 (100 mg before breakfast and dinner, eight patients) for 1 month, (c) after 1-month administration of placebo (double-blind crossover study). All patients were on standard diets (30 kcal kg-1, 45% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 20% protein). BAYo1248 reduced postprandial hyperglycaemia and insulin requirements (vs. values in control and placebo experiments) after breakfast (124 +/- 8 vs. 159 +/- 8 and 158 +/- 8 mg dl-1, 16 +/- 2 vs. 24 +/- 4 and 23 +/- 3 units, P less than 0.01) and lunch (138 +/- 7 vs. 155 +/- 11 and 162 +/- 13 mg dl-1, 19 +/- 3 vs. 24 +/- 3 and 23 +/- 3 units, P less than 0.01) whereas BAYm1099 reduced postprandial hyperglycaemia and insulin requirements after breakfast (127 +/- 4 vs. 167 +/- 12 and 159 +/- 6 mg dl-1, 15 +/- 3 vs. 24 +/- 4 and 21 +/- 3 units, P less than 0.02) and dinner (128 +/- 4 vs. 169 +/- 7 and 157 +/- 10 mg dl-1, 19 +/- 2 vs. 28 +/- 3 and 25 +/- 2 units, P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3840923": "The reported incidence of thyroid carcinoma in Hashimoto's thyroiditis varies widely. For this reason the specific subpopulation of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a solitary cold nodule was analyzed. Between 1972 and 1984 we operated on 146 consecutive patients with solitary cold nodules and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. There were 47 carcinomas, for an incidence of 32%. The mean age of the 146 patients was 43 1/2 years (median 44 years), with 126 females and 20 males. There was a history of prior head and neck radiation exposure in 54 patients, with a 33% incidence of thyroid carcinoma. The 92 patients without a history of radiation exposure had a 31.5% incidence of carcinoma. The frequency of multicentricity (bilateralism) was 33% in the group that underwent radiation and 24% in the group that did not. To date, with a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, there have been no deaths and no evidence of recurrence. In conclusion, we report a 32% incidence of thyroid carcinoma in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a solitary cold nodule, with no apparent difference between the patients with or without a history of radiation exposure, although there was a higher incidence of bilateralism (33% versus 24%) in the carcinomas of the patients with a history of head and neck irradiation. We suggest that the operative management of these patients is total thyroidectomy for those with a history of head and neck radiation and thyroid lobectomy for patients with no history of radiation, followed by contralateral lobectomy if a carcinoma is demonstrated.", "PMC2702303": "Sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) have been examined in human lymphocytes following in vitro treatments with metal salts, nickel sulfate, lead sulfate and sodium arsenite. All of the metal salts produced significant increases in the SCE frequencies over the levels for untreated lymphocytes. The SCE frequencies were also examined for metal treatments combined with ultraviolet light (200 ergs/mm2). For the lead treatments combined with the UV dose selected, an additive SCE response was observed compared to the SCE responses for UV or metal alone. The nickel and arsenite treatments combined with UV produced a less than additive SCE response for most concentrations tested. These results suggest that nickel or arsenite present in complex mixtures may reduce the SCE response to other compounds in the mixture normally capable of producing a much stronger SCE response and therefore lead to an underestimate of the effects of chemical exposure.", "PMC3792054": "Obese strain (OS) chickens hatched in the NIU vivarium were observed, primarily with respect to serum lipid and lipoprotein parameters, over a period of 36 weeks. The hypothyroid birds began to show differences in total serum lipids as compared to non-OS controls as early as 4 weeks post-hatching. All lipaemic chickens displayed lack (or deficiency) of thyroid tissue. Although all the thyroid deficient chickens showed increases in serum lipids, they were individually highly variable with respect to both quantity of serum lipid and time of onset of severe lipaemia. Six of twenty four OS birds became severely hyperlipaemic. One of these displayed a level of serum lipid amounting to 323 mg/ml. The increased serum lipid consisted primarily of triglyceride and phospholipid and was not accompanied by corresponding increases in apoproteins B or A-I. However, because of its high content of palmitic acid, oleic acid and phospholipid, the bulk of the serum lipid in OS birds appeared to be derived from the liver rather than directly from the diet. It is concluded that sufficient phospholipid was present in the plasma to form micelles, thus reducing requirements for association of solubilizing apoproteins. Livers were considerably enlarged in hyperlipaemic birds, possibly to compensate for decreases in lipid synthesizing enzymes per unit mass of tissue. However, results of gamma-irradiation of OS chickens (showing exacerbation of hyperlipaemia) indicated that hyperlipaemia in OS birds may be largely due to widespread failure of the body's cells to utilize foodstuffs and of adipose tissue to store excessive amounts of fatty acids as triglyceride.", "PMC3281791": "1. A unique caseinolytic activity was found in the crude extract from chicken and rat skeletal muscle.

It hardly hydrolyzed casein below 50 degrees C, but in the presence of 5 M urea it showed relatively high activity at 30 degrees C. The activity was completely stable at 50 degrees C for 1 hr. 3. The activity seems to be contained in a high mol. wt (450,000) protein from the elution volume and is due to cysteine proteinase from the effect of inhibitors. 4. The above properties agreed with those of the heat-stable alkaline proteinase (HAP) of fish purified homogeneously by electrophoresis.

A review of the European literature and unpublished studies supplied by the manufacturer (Laboratoires Fournier, Dijon, France) has been compiled with the data recently reported from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study completed in the United States. In general, fenofibrate has been found to reduce serum triglyceride levels by 30 to 60 percent in patients with type II B and IV hyperlipoproteinemia. Serum cholesterol levels were also reduced by 20 to 25 percent in this group of hypertriglyceridemic patients. A similar reduction in serum cholesterol levels was also found in type II A patients (normal triglyceride levels). Low-density lipoprotein levels were usually reduced in those patients with elevated levels and high-density lipoprotein levels increased when baseline levels were low. Fenofibrate also produced a 10 to 28 percent reduction in uric acid that was sustained for years. The incidence of unwanted effects ranged from 2 to 15 percent in the open trials lasting from a few months up to six years. Gastrointestinal problems (abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and constipation) are most common, occurring in approximately 5 percent of patients. Reports including fatigue, headache, loss of libido, impotence, dizziness, and insomnia were grouped as neurologic and occurred with a total incidence of 3 to 4 percent. In about 1 percent of patients, muscle tenderness developed, often accompanied by elevated creatine phosphokinase levels. These and the gastrointestinal problems occurred with a similar frequency in the placebo-treated cohort in controlled studies. In approximately 2 percent of patients, a skin rash developed, an incidence that appears significantly higher than that of placebo control groups. Liver changes in rodents have included marked peroxisome proliferation and increased hepatic carcinomas with very high doses. In humans, only a small increase in incidence of elevated levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase seems to be present and is not clearly different from that of the control groups. Alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin levels are often decreased with no known undesirable effects.

However the problem of the interaction between these agents is less extensively documented, and the role of the high consumptions of alcohol has not been studied frequently. A case-control analysis was undertaken to investigate the joint effect of alcohol and tobacco by comparing 197 glottic and 214 supraglottic cancer cases to 4135 controls representative of the French general population. Heavy drinkers were available from the two groups of cases, the highest alcohol category being equivalent to a consumption of more than 2 litres of wine per day. The relative risks estimated for heavy drinkers and smokers were high, and the results indicated an even stronger effect of alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking on the upper part of the laryngeal region. Additive and multiplicative models were fitted to the data. The multiplicative hypothesis was found to be the most appropriate, implying that the risks associated with alcohol and tobacco multiply when the exposures occur simultaneously. The public health implications of this result and the contribution of heavy drinkers and smokers to the frequency of upper respiratory and digestive tract cancers are discussed.", "PMC3410849": "Nephritogenoside is a glycopeptide with the ability to induce chronic progressive glomerulonephritis (end stage kidney) in homologous animals, by a single footpad injection.

The stability of a defined hairpin structure containing a ribosome binding site was varied over 12 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) by site-directed mutagenesis and the effects on protein yields were analyzed in vivo. The results reveal a strict correlation between translational efficiency and the stability of the helix. An increase in its delta G0 of -1.4 kcal/mol (i.e., less than the difference between an A.U and a G.C pair) corresponds to the reduction by a factor of 10 in initiation rate. Accordingly, a single nucleotide substitution led to the decrease by a factor of 500 in expression because it turned a mismatch in the helix into a match. We find no evidence that exposure of only the Shine-Dalgarno region or the start codon preferentially favors recognition. Translational efficiency is strictly correlated with the fraction of mRNA molecules in which the ribosome binding site is unfolded, indicating that initiation is completely dependent on spontaneous unfolding of the entire initiation region. Ribosomes appear not to recognize nucleotides outside the Shine-Dalgarno region and the initiation codon.", "PMC2589298": "A white man in a remote area of Alaska shot himself simultaneously with two revolvers--a .41 magnum and a .44 magnum.

Nearly all purified surface A2B5(-) cells were identified as glia by immunoreactivity for either glutamine synthetase of galactocerebroside. Most (approximately 80%) of the purified A2B5(-) cells became A2B5(+) after 1 day in culture, although no increase in the percentage of A2B5(+) cells (from 45%) was observed in control cultures of unpurified cells. Long-term monolayer cultures from purified cells contained A2B5(+) cells with mostly flattened glial-like or round process-free morphology, whereas those from unpurified cells contained many A2B5(+) neurons. The non-neuronal A2B5(+) cells frequently reacted with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein and another marker expressed by embryonic brain glia, 5A11. Additionally, some flattened glia-like cells exhibited elaborate networks of anti-neurofilament-M-reactive filaments. We believe these unusual phenotypes, which appeared only in cultures of purified A2B5(-) cells, arose in response to the immunomagnetic removal of neurons. In conjunction with previous findings, we conclude that the abnormal phenotypes in purified cell cultures represent glia that were unsuccessful in attempting to replenish the depleted neuronal population.

To elucidate the target region, 3 different functional parameters were studied: (1) Post-synaptic endplate potentials (EPPs) resulting from evoked transmitter release; (2) Post-synaptic miniature endplate potentials (MEPPSs) resulting from spontaneous transmitter release; and (3) Presynaptic ion currents at the nerve terminal. At a concentration of 0.5 mM/l thallium acetate, EPP amplitudes were irreversibly decreased while MEPP amplitudes remained unaffected. MEPP frequencies were reversibly increased, indicating a presynaptic rather than a post-synaptic target site of thallium toxicity. The subpopulation of small MEPPs (sub-MEPPs) behaved like the MEPP population, except that upon addition of 4-AP, the sub-MEPP population was augmented at the cost of the MEPP population. In view of the slow time course of the toxic effects (30 min for a 10-fold increase of MEPP frequency, 100-180 min for a 50% reduction of EPP amplitudes), it is concluded that thallium needs to be transported across the cell membrane before it finally interferes with release mechanisms. It is hypothesised that thallium reduces the number of active sites recruited by one action potential (reduced EPP amplitude), while at the same time the probability of transmitter liberation is enhanced (increased MEPP frequency). The rather indirect mode of action of thallium was also found when presynaptic ion currents were recorded using extracellular electrodes. In proportion to the decrease of the EPP amplitudes, a reduction of all inward and outward currents was observed. This effect was also irreversible. It is concluded that in spite of some similarities, thallium behaves quite differently from bivalent heavy metals like cobalt and cadmium, which act as competitive calcium antagonists at the presynaptic nerve terminal. In these toxic substances, the time course of intoxication is much faster, the required concentration is much lower, and the inhibition of the slow calcium current is reversible.", "PMC2074314": "The purpose of this study was to find out the factors influenced on the survival of amalgam dental restoration. The study population was the amalgam restoration of 726 molar teeth, 3 restoration types, cavity class I, class I other surface and class I compound, of Bangkok Metropolitan school children aged 6-12 years. The data showed how the survival of restoration placed in teeth varied with the restoration aged ranging 6-30 months. The result indicated that there were 48.10% of broken filling and 19.42% of secondary caries. The rate of broken filling was significantly related to the child age at the time of treatment, the restoration age, the surface texture of the restoration and the restoration type (p less than 0.01). As for the rate of secondary caries, there were significant correlation with the surface texture of the filling, the restoration type and the factor \"broken filling\" (p less than 0.01). By means of the linear multiple regression, it told us explicitly about the magnitude of the relation that the surface texture of the filling was the major influential factor which could predict the variance of broken filling about 18.29% while the broken filling was also the major influential factor which could predict the variance of secondary caries about 7.93%.", "PMC2109041": "The rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, undergoes neuron-like morphological, biochemical and electrophysiological differentiation, in the presence of low concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF-treated PC12 cells have been shown previously to support 139A scrapie agent replication. In the present report we extended these findings and analysed the cellular conditions necessary for agent replication. Following the infection of differentiated PC12 cells, scrapie replicated to relatively high titres as determined by an incubation period assay. The removal of NGF, which causes the gradual dedifferentiation of PC12 cells, resulted in the inability of scrapie to replicate. The scrapie infectivity detected in PC12 cultures is cell-associated and not released into the medium. Cells in infected cultures did not show any change in morphology when compared to cells in mock-infected cultures. Titration studies of scrapie infectivity in PC12 cells have indicated that up to 4 LD50 units per cell can be obtained although a yield of 1 LD50 per cell was more common. Using an approximate m.o.i. of 1, only differentiated PC12 cells supported 139A scrapie agent replication when compared to two other differentiated, neuronal cell types, indicating that PC12 cells are more susceptible to agent replication.

In the present study, an antibody raised against purified erythrocyte calpain I was biochemically characterized and demonstrated to specifically bind the Mr = 80,000 subunit of both rat erythrocyte and brain calpain I. This antibody was used to examine the cellular distribution of calpain I at the electron microscopic level in rat brain and spinal cord using the avidin-biotin immunocytochemical technique. Reaction product was observed throughout neuronal perikarya, within both axonal and dendritic processes, and within spine heads and necks. Postsynaptic densities in both shaft and spine synapses were also immunoreactive. Glial cell bodies and processes were densely stained. In both neurons and glia, the reaction product was deposited along cytoskeletal elements. The localization of calpain I immunoreactivity to glial processes suggests this degradative enzyme may play a role in the glial hypertrophy and process retraction seen in brain. The presence of the enzyme in spines and postsynaptic densities is consistent with the hypothesis that it is involved in the turnover of synaptic cytoskeleton, thus providing a means through which transient physiological events effect lasting changes in the chemistry and morphology of spines.", "PMC3312296": "Reporting colorectal cancer comprises two phases: the careful collection of pathological data; and the division of patients into groups with differing prognoses.

It evolved over many years, and full details of its final form were not published until 1958, towards the end of his career. Others modified the classification during its evolution, and numerous rival pathological and clinicopathological systems now exist. The resulting confusion that surrounds the Dukes classification may make it impossible to compare pathological findings and the results of treatment between different centres. The importance of meticulous dissection and examination of surgical specimens is emphasised and a simple set of recommendations made. It is shown how modern statistical methods may identify pathological variables that have independent clinical importance. On the basis of this information a new system of prognostic categorisation for patients receiving apparently curative surgery for rectal cancer has been developed, which is superior to the Dukes classification in that it can place many more patients into groups with clear prognostic implications.", "PMC3813383": "Percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation was used in the management of 13 cases of upper airway obstruction. Cases are subdivided according to the nature of the presenting airway problem. The first group had stable upper airway abnormalities; the second group presented as emergencies with rapidly evolving upper airway obstruction. This technique has two major advantages: 1) it provides rapid access to the airway during acute emergencies; and 2) it provides control of the airway where tissue distortion from head and neck trauma or tumor surgery makes standard anesthetic techniques difficult. Complications including catheter displacement, total expiratory obstruction, pneumothorax, and subcutaneous emphysema have been encountered. The authors conclude that percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation is effective. However, potential problems exist and an in-depth understanding of the technique is necessary for its appropriate application and successful use.", "PMC3124492": "We have studied the arrangement of the pectineal ligament or its equivalent, the uveal trabecula, in herbivores, carnivores, primates and humans. From our investigations, the pectineal ligament, the uveal trabecula and the so-called processes of the iris form a morphological unit that is made up of the tendinous fibres of the longitudinal portion of the ciliary muscle, that are inserted into the periphery of Descemet's membrane and send out ahead prolongations that extend to the anterior face of the iris. The so-called processes of the iris cannot be considered as independent structures since they represent the innermost fibres of the trabecular or uveal meshwork; in some species these have a thicker appearance, an arrangement that can occasionally be found in the human eye.", "PMC2843734": "Twenty-three prepubertal subjects treated for Wilms' tumor (10 males and 13 females) were endocrinologically evaluated off therapy from 0.5 to 4.08 years. They were divided into two groups: 11 subjects (6M, 5F) who had received chemotherapy only (group 1) and 12 (4M, 8F) who had in addition received abdominal radiation (1,500-3,000 rads) (group 2). Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free tri-iodo thyronine (FT3), testosterone (T), estradiol-17 beta (E2), and cortisol (F) were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Plasma levels of TSH, PRL, FT4, FT3, and F were normal in both groups, as were FSH, LH, T, and E2 in group 1. In group 2, female subjects showed FSH levels significantly higher than controls, while LH and E2 were normal; male subjects showed significantly higher LH levels, while FSH and T levels were normal. These results indicate that in the treatment protocol used by us for Wilms' tumor (WT), chemotherapy does not affect endocrine function, whereas abdominal radiation seems to damage gonadal function directly. The present findings indicate that gonadal damage may be revealed in WT before puberty not only in females, as has been previously reported, but also in male subjects.", "PMC3220764": "Ten patients with severe palmo-plantar hyperhidrosis have been treated successfully at home with tap water iontophoresis for a period not less than 6 months. The patients were asked to evaluate the treatment subjectively; 8 considered the results to have been good to very good. The same results were obtained in an objective evaluation by gravimetry, hygrometry and colorimetry. The full effects were seen after an average of 15 treatments of 20-30 min each. Through the new possibility of treating patients at home, therapy for palmo-plantar hyperhidrosis, which to date was only possible under medical supervision, has been simplified.", "PMC3085332": "Different histochemical techniques were compared on paraffin wax embedded tissue sections for routine classification of amyloid; the following methods were used: potassium permanganate, the indirect immunoperoxidase method using polyclonal anti-human amyloid antisera (anti-AA, anti-A lambda, anti-A kappa and anti-AF) and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method using antisera against human, bovine, hamster and canine AA amyloid. Anti-human AA antiserum appeared to be a useful tool in this respect. Polyclonal anti-AL antisera may be helpful in diagnosing AL amyloid, but were less of value than anti-AA serum. Strong cross reactivity between anti-bovine AA antiserum and human AA amyloid deposits was found. This indicates that animal amyloid AA antisera can also be used for the diagnosis of AA amyloid in human tissues.", "PMC2107327": "Doublet preference analysis was carried out on coding and noncoding regions of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and human mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. The preference pattern in 1-2 and 2-3 doublets in E. coli and S. cerevisiae correlated with that in noncoding regions. The 3-1 doublet preference in E. coli genes with low optimal codon frequency and in S. cerevisiae genes also showed a correlation with each of their noncoding doublet preference. A mechanism to explain these double preference correlations in doublet preference is presented: mutational biases, the origin of the noncoding region doublet preference, evolved so as to maintain the 1-2 and 2-3 doublet preference, which is determined by codon usage. These biases then acted on the 3-1 doublet, which was almost free of coding constraints, resulting in a similar preference in this doublet.", "PMC2373488": "Although the liver is known to extract amino acids and organic anions by well-characterized transport systems, the factors that regulate the hepatic uptake of small, circulating peptides are poorly understood. We previously reported that cholecystokinin octapeptide, a biologically active form of cholecystokinin, is efficiently cleared by the liver and that uptake depends on its carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide (Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH2). Here we further define the physicochemical determinants for hepatic clearance of cholecystokinin. A series of 13 tetrapeptides, including eight analogs of the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide of cholecystokinin-8 with different charges, hydrophobicity and amino-acid sequences, were prepared by solid-phase synthesis, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by amino-acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Radioiodination was performed by oxidative or nonoxidative techniques. Hydrophobicity of individual radiolabeled peptides was calculated using published hydrophobicity data or measured directly by determining their partition between octanol and aqueous triethylammonium acetate. First-pass hepatic extraction of radiolabeled peptides was determined with a nonrecirculating, isolated, perfused rat liver model. First-pass hepatic extraction of injected, labeled peptides varied from 4% to 86% and correlated significantly (r = 0.85; p less than 0.0002) with hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic peptides with positive, neutral or negative charges were avidly extracted (30% to 86%) by the liver; first-pass clearance of hydrophobic peptides with similar charges varied with amino-acid sequence. In contrast, the first-pass hepatic extraction of positively or negatively charged hydrophilic tetrapeptides was negligible (less than 10%). These results suggest that hydrophobicity and amino-acid sequence--but not anionic or cationic nature--are the major determinants of hepatic extraction of cholecystokinin, and perhaps other small, circulating peptides.", "PMC2107323": "A distance measure that reflects the dissimilarity among structures has been developed on the basis of the three-dimensional structures of similar proteins, this being totally independent of sequence in the sense that only the relative spatial positions of mainchain alpha-carbon atoms need be known. This procedure leads to phyletic relationships that are in general correlated with the sequence phylogenies based on residue type. Such relationships among known protein three-dimensional structures are also a useful aid to their classification and selection in knowledge-based modeling using homologous structures. We have applied this approach to six homologous sets of proteins: immunoglobulin fragments, globins, cytochromes c, serine proteinases, eye-lens gamma crystallins, and dinucleotide-binding domains.", "PMC2916016": "The minor fissure was studied with thin computed tomographic (CT) sections in 40 patients. It was absent in eight (20%) and seen in 32 (80%) patients; of these 32 the fissure was complete in seven (22%), incomplete in 23 (72%), and of indeterminate completeness in two (6%). Appearance of the minor fissure on CT scans can be categorized into two major configurations, which are determined by variation in contour of the middle lobe upper surface. The location of the highest point along this surface is either medial (type I configuration) or lateral (type II configuration). The lowest tributary of the vein draining the anterior segment of the upper lobe was seen in 75% of the patients. This vessel was a reliable landmark in delineating boundaries between upper and middle lobes, even when the fissure was radiologically incomplete or absent. In the authors' experience, familiarity with these configurations of the minor fissure has been useful in localization of a lesion in a lobe or determination of its possible extension beyond the fissure into the neighboring lobe.", "PMC2491639": "Lymphoid irradiation is known to prevent spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in susceptible BB rats. The present studies investigated further the effects of radiation in diabetes prone (DP) and resistant (DR) BB/Wor rats, and histocompatible Yoshida (YOS) rats. Single doses of total body gamma irradiation (125-600 rads) induced diabetes within 22-44 days in 20 of 102 (20%) 30 day old DR rats, less than 1% of which develop the disease. Radiation was also associated with (1) a reduction in the ratio of W3/25+ to OX8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes within 2 weeks, and (2) a decreased percentage of lymph node cells expressing the RT6.1 surface alloantigen 3-4 weeks after treatment. Similar doses of irradiation did not alter the frequency or age at onset of diabetes in DP rats, and did not induce diabetes in YOS rats. When a single dose of 250 or 500 rads of gamma irradiation was followed by injection of mitogen activated spleen cells from acutely diabetic rats to adoptively transfer diabetes, 16 of 19 (84%) DR and 8 of 14 (57%) YOS rats became diabetic. Long term exposure to ultraviolet irradiation (UVB) did not alter the frequency or age at onset of diabetes in either DP or DR rats. We conclude that there may exist a population of regulatory cells relatively sensitive to gamma irradiation that play a role in determining the susceptibility of rats to autoimmune diabetes mellitus.", "PMC1913207": "Serum lipid levels were determined in 287 obese subjects and the findings were compared with the mean values recorded in a representative series of the population of the Slovak Republic (n = 3433).

The mechanisms triggering this abnormal expression by epithelial cells are not well known, and we tried to induce this phenomenon on primary cultures of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Confluent RPE-cell monolayers were supplemented with several biological or chemical reagents [recombinant interferon gamma, phytohemagglutinin A-P (PHA-P), phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA), recombinant interleukin-2, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Insulin], to investigate their ability to induce HLA DR and DQ expression. On days 1, 3 and 5 after stimulation, the cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies directed against human class II antigens: all reagents used failed to induce class II antigen: all reagents used failed to induce class II antigen expression. However, on day 7, we demonstrated the presence of numerous positive HLA DR and HLA DQ cells stimulated by gamma interferon, the percentages being closely related to the dose of this lymphokine. These findings, together with those of other investigators and our previous work on uveal pigmented epithelial cells in diabetic patients, may shed light on the exact implication of RPE in many poorly documented ocular diseases.", "PMC3677617": "1.

Subsequent studies have investigated the mechanisms of these interactions. With respect to the effect of antacids, the absorption of all quinolones appears to be significantly reduced by antacids containing magnesium and/or aluminum, and concomitant administration must be avoided. Other cations, such as calcium, iron, and probably zinc, appear to interact in a similar manner. Chelation between the quinolone and cation is the most likely mechanism. With respect to the effect on theophylline metabolism, quinolones inhibit specific cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of methylxanthines, although there are major differences between the quinolones. Enoxacin is the most potent inhibitor, followed by ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin. Caffeine metabolism is also inhibited, although the clinical significance is uncertain. Case reports describe renal failure associated with concomitant administration of cyclosporine and ciprofloxacin, although controlled trials have not demonstrated an interaction. Enoxacin has little effect on warfarin metabolism, suggesting that other quinolones may not affect warfarin disposition. Case reports of central nervous system toxicity from administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and quinolones need confirmation. Patients should be monitored closely when potential interacting agents are used; it is probable that not all interactions have been identified.", "PMC3354956": "The spinal nerve root origins of the cutaneous nerves innervating the canine pelvic limb were determined in 12 barbiturate-anesthetized, healthy dogs by stimulating the dorsal roots L1-S3 and recording the evoked-action potentials from each cutaneous nerve. The dogs were then euthanatized, identification of each dorsal root and cutaneous nerve was verified by dissection, and the type of lumbosacral plexus (prefixed, median fixed, or postfixed) was determined. With one exception, the dorsal cutaneous branches and lateral cutaneous branches of L1-L3 originated only from their corresponding spinal nerve roots. The genitofemoral nerve received afferent fibers predominantly from L3-L4 nerve roots. The lateral cutaneous femoral nerve originated from L3-L5 nerve roots, and the saphenous nerve from L4-L6 nerve roots. The proximal caudal cutaneous sural nerve originated from L6-S1.

Previous data indicate that in vitro maturation and differentiation of monocytes result in alteration of this property with greatly diminished response to stimulators of release of prostaglandin E (PGE) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) occurring after cells have been cultured. To further study the effects of differentiation on human monocyte AA metabolism, a model system was established based upon the human histiocytic cell line U937. Among tested stimulants, which included opsonized zymosan, complement fragment C3b, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore A23187, and concanavalin A, it was found that Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was unique in that it stimulated increased release of TxB2 from U937 cells. The effect of the phorbol ester PMA, a compound commonly used to induce differentiation of U937, on the ability of U937 to respond to LPS was examined. Following 48 hr of treatment with PMA, U937 became capable of releasing both PGE and TxB2 in response to small doses of LPS. As previously observed for human monocytes, the release of PGE was delayed for several hours following stimulation and failed to reach maximal cumulative levels in culture until 24-48 hr following stimulation. In contrast to human monocytes, PMA-induced U937 were capable of maintaining their responsiveness to LPS for several days. Thus, the U937 cell line provides a useful model for study of the effects of differentiation of human mononuclear phagocytes on their ability to metabolize AA, and for the effects of LPS on histiocytic tumor cell prostaglandin release.", "PMC3265481": "An I-Ab-restricted, L3T4+ Ly2- T-cell clone, 5R-4F3, specific for ABAtyr was established in culture from a B10.A(5R) mouse. Since b haplotype mice respond weakly to ABAtyr compared to other haplotypes, this is a candidate clone of low responder phenotype. In support of this contention, 5R-4F3 grew very poorly under conditions that supported the vigorous growth of E beta bE alpha k-restricted T-cell clones from the same mouse. The I-A (low responder) and I-E (high responder) restricted T-cell clones also differed in their responses to apc pre-pulsed with antigen, compared to apc with antigen present continuously during culture. The low and high responder clones responded comparably to IL-2. Attempts to elevate the response of C57BL/6 mice to ABAtyr in vivo by injecting them with human recombinant IL-2 and antigen together were only partially successful: C57BL/6 mice treated in this way showed a 3-5-fold increase in their proliferative responses to ABAtyr, which was at best only one quarter of the level of response shown by high responder A/J mice to the same antigen dose.", "PMC3931371": "Extracts of S. asoca bark and pure compounds isolated from the bark were tested for properties that might inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid by the PGH2 synthetase.

Two procyanidin dimers from the ethyl acetate extract showed enzyme catalyzed oxidation in our assay. The ether extract of the bark was also found to contain yet unknown substances which were capable of being oxidised by the PGH2 synthetase.

The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the principles of this calculation technique and to critically assess its application to plasma clearance studies. We begin by tracing the history of the measurement of renal clearance of plasma. We then proceed to exposit the relevant principles of the synthesis technique.

Percussion was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in airflow obstruction, measured as a reduction in FEV1 after the treatment. There were no differences in the deposition or clearance of inhaled radiolabelled particles between the 2 forms of treatment. Changes in oxygen saturation were small and insignificant during both forms of treatment.

Osteoclasts from op/op mice are small, few in number and have an abnormal cytoplasmic distribution of the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase. In contrast to the three other mutations that transmit osteopetrosis in mice, the skeletal signs of the disease slowly disappear in op/op animals after bone matrix formation declines about 6 weeks after birth from 145 percent to 20 percent of that in normal siblings.

Under hormonal therapy, the typical epithelial and stromal changes were evident, like coarse vacuolization of cytoplasm, progressive nuclear pyknosis, stroma edema, as well as stroma sclerosis and hyalinosis. Under radiotherapy, the degree of stroma sclerosis and nuclear changes was even more evident. Polynuclear, bizarre tumor cells predominated. With responsiveness of the carcinomas to hormonal or radiotherapy, the immunohistochemical markers (prostate-specific antigen, acid prostate phosphatase) were markedly reduced or missing. Glandular carcinomas, up to 5 years after therapy, showed regression grade I in 30.1%, II in 18.3, III in 43.0% and X in 8.6%. In cribriform/solid trabecular carcinomas, the regression was less marked. Grade I was observed in 42.9%, grade II in 21.4%, and grade III in 35.7% of the cases. There was no regression grade X. The results have shown that responsiveness of carcinomas to therapy can well be analyzed by use of certain histological and cytological criteria for grading and regressional grading. The experiences so far have shown that concerning radiation, 12-18 months after conclusion of therapy is a favorable moment for posttherapy controls. Under hormonal therapy, the therapy control should be performed 6 months after beginning.

Analysis of the immunopurified interferon by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed biologically active bands of about 19.5, and 14 kd. Under nonreducing conditions, three active bands at 35, 19.5, and 14 kd could be seen. Gel filtration of the immunopurified MuIFN-gamma under reducing or nonreducing conditions showed a single major peak of antiviral activity corresponding to a molecular weight of 43 kd.

With the vitrified wheels made of the GC abrasive, at a higher the wheel circumferential speed and heavier the grinding pressure, the cutting rate was greater, accompanied by violent wear of the wheel. Being independent of the wheel speed, the grinding ratio reached about 1 under pressure heavier than 100 gf. The MgO-MgCl2-bonded wheels of the C abrasive exhibited a similar tendency. The manner in which the wheel was moved over the work during grinding proved to be very important, compared with the Ni-Cr alloy as reported previously. Only depression of the wheel against the work resulted in chemical attrition of the abrasive and discoloration of the work surface, or grinding burn, due to oxidation of titanium. Even when the wheel was moved over the work, chip-formation process of the cutting edge was far from ideal, and the work surface was contaminated due to reaction of titanium with the abrasive. At a higher wheel circumferential speed, more chips were loaded or built-up in the wheel and strongly rubbed the work surface, resulting in violent wear of the wheel; loading and dislodging of such chips were repeated.", "PMC3753642": "Combination Chemotherapy with Adriamycin (VEPA) was applied to 16 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Histologically, the complete remission rate in cases of large-cell type treated with VEPA therapy was 40%, while that with non-VEPA therapy was 14.3%. No cases of stage IV showed complete remission, whereas the complete remission rate for cases of stage III was 37.5% for VEPA therapy, but 27.6% for non-VEPA therapy.

In lesser numbers, SP also occur in the brains of nondemented aged humans and nonhuman primates. To date, it is not known whether neurites in individual SP derive from neurons of one or several neurotransmitter systems. In aged monkeys, two strategies were used to test the hypothesis that individual SP can contain abnormal neurites arising from multiple neuronal systems. First, immunocytochemical methods were used to identify somatostatin-immunoreactive neurites in plaques, and these sections were subsequently stained with silver to visualize other neurites. Numerous plaques contained both somatostatin-positive and somatostatin-negative (i.e. argyrophilic only) neurites, suggesting that more than one transmitter system contributed neurites to each of these plaques. Second, two-color immunocytochemical techniques showed, in a small percentage of plaques, that cholinergic neurites coexist with neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing neurites or catecholaminergic neurites. These results suggest that the formation of SP may result from events that involve abnormalities of neuronal processes arising from multiple transmitter systems.", "PMC3708865": "Patterns of circulating prolactin bioactivity during three stages of the menstrual cycle were studied in detail in four normally cycling women. Serial blood samples were withdrawn at 10 or 15 min intervals for up to 8 h. Plasma prolaction concentrations were quantitated by a bioassay which is based on the replication of a rat lymphoma cell line (Nb2 node) and by conventional radioimmunoassay. A total of 50-103 samples from each patient was analysed. Using a threshold-based algorithm, definite pulsations of prolactin biological (B) and immunological (I) activity were detected at most stages of the menstrual cycle. The periodicity of these peaks ranges from 1 to 1 1/2 h. However, pulsations were less evident in one subject who had asymptomatic hyperprolactinaemia although circulating prolactin was fully bioactive (mean B:I ratios being 1.02-1.25). B:I ratios in the three normoprolactinaemic women were generally lower, ranging from 0.39 +/- 0.02 to 0.93 +/- 0.03. Elevations in the B:I ratio of normoprolactinaemic women were associated with bioactive peaks; this was not always the case in the hyperprolactinaemic subject. Thus, the lack of symptoms in this hyperprolactinaemic subject could not be due to bioinactive prolactin, but might perhaps be due to the absence of episodic prolactin secretion which would desensitise target organs.", "PMC3965011": "Samples of blood were collected from a group of plant workers engaged in the manufacture of ethylene oxide (EO) for periods of up to 14 years and also from a group of control personnel matched by age and smoking habits. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for cytogenetic analysis. Selected immune and haematological parameters were also investigated. The results of these studies showed no statistically significant difference between the group of plant workers and the control group in respect of any of the biological parameters investigated in this study. Nevertheless, duration of employment in EO manufacturing was positively correlated (p less than 0.05) with the frequency of chromosome breaks and with the percentage of neutrophils in a differential white blood cell count and negatively correlated (p less than 0.05) with the percentage of lymphocytes. As the values of these parameters remained within the normal limits of control populations, the correlations were considered to have no significance for health. Atmospheric concentrations of EO were determined using personnel air samplers and were generally below the detection limit (less than 0.05 ppm) during stable plant operations, although transient concentrations of up to 8 ppm were occasionally recorded. The amount of alkylation (2-hydroxyethyl groups) of the Nt atom of histidinyl residues in haemoglobin was also measured in an attempt to gauge recent individual exposures to EO. Variable but, in most instances, readily measurable amounts of Nt-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-L-histidine (Nt represents the N3 atom of histidine) were found in the haemoglobin of plant workers and in the control group who had not knowingly been exposed to an exogenous source of EO. There was no statistically significant difference between the results obtained in the control group and in the group of plant workers.", "PMC3597499": "From January 1981 to September 1983 forty knees had replacement of a torn anterior cruciate ligament with a tendon xenograft. In six of the first thirty knees that were operated on severe synovitis developed within eight months after the operation, and total synovectomy and removal of the graft was required. Because of this complication we changed the recommended rinsing procedure for the graft in the last ten knees, and no synovitis occurred in these. Approximately half of all of the grafts ruptured between twelve and twenty months after the operation.", "PMC5294997": "It is known from work with Puerto Rican strains of Schistosoma mansoni that in experimental bilharziasis in laboratory animals there may be a shift of flukes from the mesenteric vessels to the lungs, and that this occurs both in untreated animals and in those given chemotherapy. The work reported in this paper was undertaken to study this phenomenon with an Egyptian strain of S. mansoni.With but one exception, no schistosomes were found in groups of untreated mice autopsied 6-12 weeks after infection. Some were found in the lungs of a few mice treated 6 weeks after infection and more in the lungs of those treated 10 weeks after infection.A shift of flukes to the lungs appears to be dependent upon a number of linked factors. In the study reported, the important factor was the effect of an active compound which resulted in a passive shift of flukes from their normal sites in the mesenteric vessels. Possible routes by which schistosomes may reach the lungs are discussed.", "PMC3660739": "Content of fucose and of fucosylated protein fractions was studied in blood serum of healthy donors as well as in blood serum of patients with chronic gastritis and with stomach cancer. Concentration of fucose was increased in blood serum under conditions of the tumor generalization. At the same time, content of fucosylated albumin was elevated within early steps of stomach cancer, while the content of fucosylated globulins was decreased. Estimation of albumin-bound fucose might be used in diagnosis of stomach cancer.", "PMC1971572": "Flurazepam (F) is an extensively prescribed hypnotic (Dalmane) whose in vivo activity has been suggested to be due to its primary metabolites, hydroxyethyl flurazepam (HEF) and N-desalkylflurazepam (DAF). In order to determine the intrinsic pharmacologic activity of F, mice were administered various doses of the cytochrome P-450 suicide inactivator, 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT), 1 hr before the ip administration of 1 mg/kg 14C-F. One hr after 14C-F, 70 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole was administered iv and the mice were observed for convulsions. F alone offered no protection from convulsion (mean brain concentrations were 3.9, 32, and 11 ng/g for F, DAF, and HEF, respectively). F with 25 mg/kg ABT also offered no protection despite a 6-fold increase in brain concentrations of F. F with 100 mg/kg ABT offered a 57% protection from convulsions (mean brain concentrations were 99, 62, and 41 ng/g for F, DAF, and HEF, respectively). One mg/kg F with 400 mg/kg ABT offered 100% protection from convulsions (brain concentrations were 190, 47, and 18 ng/g for F, DAF, and HEF, respectively). These data indicate that F has intrinsic pharmacologic activity which must be considered when evaluating the pharmacodynamics of F.", "PMC2222751": "The expression and regulation of Class I and Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and Ly-6 antigens were examined in BALB/c testicular cells. Studies were performed utilizing differentiated murine Leydig (TM3) and Sertoli (TM4) cell lines. Neither Class I (Dd) nor Class II (IA/Ed) MHC antigens were detectable on untreated TM3 cells. However, concanavalin-A activated spleen cell supernatant (Con-A sup) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment resulted in the marked induction of both Class I and Class II MHC antigens on virtually all of the Leydig cells. MHC Class II mRNA, which was not detected in resting cells, was clearly induced following IFN-gamma incubation. Sertoli cells were found to constitutively express low levels of Class I (Dd) but not Class II (IA/Ed) antigens. However, in contrast to the enhanced MHC expression in TM3 cells, Con-A sup or IFN-gamma treatment of TM4 cells resulted in marked augmentation of Class I, but not Class II, MHC antigens. Northern blot analysis failed to detect Class II mRNA in either the resting or IFN-gamma treated TM4 populations. Neither ethanol nor tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alone, or together with IFN-gamma head significant effects on MHC expression by TM3 and TM4 cells. Ly-6 antigens, predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells, were found to be present on both TM3 and TM4 cells. Expression of this non-MHC encoded product was also shown to be markedly enhanced by IFN-gamma treatment on both testicular cell lines. In total, these findings demonstrated that cytokines can differentially affect discrete cell populations arising from a particular tissue with respect to the un-regulation of MHC and non-MHC gene products. These findings are discussed in the context of autoimmune responses directed against this tissue.", "PMC2430899": "Hemoperfusion through Amberlite XAD-4 resin column has been shown to effectively remove sedative-hypnotics, analgesics and other drugs causing acute intoxication. There is no appreciable clinical toxicity and dramatic shortening of coma time and possible decrease in mortality may be achieved. Thrombocytopenia and clotting may be diminished by pre-perfusion coating with 2.5% albumin. Albumin coating may facilitate the repeated use of hemoperfusion without any complications. More recently, resin hemoperfusion has been used for procainamide, N-acetylprocainamide and theophylline intoxication achieving exceptionally high clearance rates.", "PMC3310843": "The effects of thermal processing on plasma glucose and insulin responses in healthy subjects were examined. Fourteen volunteers, after being tested with a glucose load, were randomly administered a test meal, consisting of an amount of rice, calculated to yield the same quantity of glucose, used for the glucose tolerance test (70 g). Rice (90 g, raw) was cooked in two different manners: (a) boiled in salted water and (b) baked for 10 min at 160 degrees C after boiling as in the first test. A clear difference in viscosity and in in vitro hydrolytic rates between the two rice items could be established, whereas the plasma glucose and insulin responses in the volunteers differed to a smaller extent. In particular the 60-min incremental area for glucose was significantly lower in the case of baked rice, compared to boiled rice. These findings suggest that thermal processing of complex carbohydrates may differently affect glycemic responses in man.", "PMC2543113": "Bilateral vasovasostomy in 16 rats permitted evaluation of a microsurgical technique using an original absorbable hollow stent made of polyglycolic acid. Advantages of this stent included ease of anastomosis, maintenance of luminal patency, satisfactory approximation of vasal ends, and reduction of perivasal inflammation possibly due to reduction of extravasation of sperm. Absorbable stents were eliminated within four weeks of placement, and patency was confirmed by histologic studies performed two, four, and six weeks after vasovasostomy.", "PMC3843731": "The performances of young (8-9 months) and aged (22-24 months) male ACI rats were compared in a T-maze requiring two discriminations, each of which placed different demands on memory processing. A spatial discrimination in the stem of the T-maze required long-term reference memory; a discrete-trial, alternation discrimination in the arms of the T-maze required working memory. Following acquisition training in one maze, rats were also trained in a second maze at a different location in the room. The correct response in the stem of this maze was opposite to that in the first maze. In two experiments with slightly different pretraining procedures, similar results demonstrated that aged rats made more errors in all phases of maze training than did their young counterparts. The results suggest that all components of memory processing were affected equivalently because the age-related impairment was not selectively greater in any component of the task. In a third experiment, aged rats were unimpaired in the ability to perform in a T-maze task involving a brightness discrimination with intramaze cues. This result suggests that the age-related impairment in the two-component T-maze task was restricted to the cognitive demands of the task. Neurochemical analyses were performed to determine whether regional neurotransmitter synthetic enzyme activities could be used to identify neurochemical systems associated with performance in these tasks and with any age-related impairments observed. Choline acetyltransferase and glutamic acid decarboxylase were assayed as markers for cholinergic and GABAergic systems, respectively, in the hippocampi and the following cortical regions: frontal, sensorimotor, auditory, cingulate, occipital, and pyriform-perirhinal. A slight (8%) but significant age-related decline was observed in the activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase but not of choline acetyltransferase. Although the correlation between maze performance and regional enzyme activities generally supported several previous observations, the only significant correlation to emerge was between working memory performance and glutamic acid decarboxylase activity in the cingulate cortex.", "PMC3411630": "Toxic manifestations of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I) include muscle twitching and muscle fiber necrosis, in addition to muscarinic manifestations of acetylcholine excess. The AChE-Is pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman) or diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) were administered to rats to produce spontaneous muscle fiber discharges. Soman produced discharges that arose primarily from the central nervous system (CNS), while those due to DFP were generated from the peripheral nerves as well as the CNS. Three drugs were tested for their potential to reduce muscle fiber discharges: atropine methyl nitrate (AMN), ketamine, and phenytoin. Ketamine caused a significant decrease in discharges of CNS origin, while AMN and phenytoin had no effect. For muscle fiber discharges of peripheral origin, all three drugs produced a significant drop in muscle fiber discharges, but phenytoin showed slightly more efficacy than the others. AChE-I-induced muscle hyperactivity arises from actions on the CNS and on the peripheral nerve in varying proportions for different AChE-Is. Treatment for the toxicity of AChE-Is on muscle may be accomplished by administering drugs with distinctive pharmacological actions at target sites in the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) where AChE-Is exert their effects. By attenuating the effects of AChE-Is at specific CNS or PNS sites, the neuromuscular toxicity can be reduced in a manner specific to the characteristic sites of toxicity of each AChE-I.", "PMC2195512": "This article reports on four tumour patients with extensive, but cytologically innocuous pericardial effusion. In three cases, a tumour-cell-negative pleural effusion, on the left, was also present. Thoracoscopy showed that the pleura were unremarkable, whereupon, with the aid of the biopsy forceps--in one case the Nd:YAG laser--the pericardium was opened. The procedure provided diagnostically high-yielding material; in addition, pericardial tamponade was \"permanently\" eliminated (period of observation up to 4 years). This shows that, in addition to its diagnostic value, thoracoscopic pericardial fenestration also can be therapeutic. It represents an alternative to the surgical approach.", "PMC3166876": "Patella height was defined by the distance between the midpoint of the articular surface of the patella and the condylar plane, which was constructed perpendicular to the mechanical axis of the tibia. In two series of normal individuals the measured distances were related to body height and the length of the lower leg and thus expressed as its ratio, which was the same in both sexes. The measurements were performed on lateral radiographs of the knee and lower leg obtained in weight-bearing and 30 degrees to 40 degrees of knee flexion using a simple device to obtain a standardized position of the lower leg during the examination. The standing position is proposed for these measurements since the patellar ligament is shorter in the recumbent position. The method can be used for biomechanical analysis of the femoropatellar joint.", "PMC2108717": "The involvement of DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and delta in DNA repair synthesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was investigated in human fibroblasts (HF). The effects of anti-(DNA polymerase alpha) monoclonal antibody, (p-n-butylphenyl)deoxyguanosine triphosphate (BuPdGTP), dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP), and aphidicolin on MNNG-induced DNA repair synthesis were investigated to dissect the roles of the different DNA polymerases. A subcellular system (permeable cells), in which DNA repair synthesis and DNA replication were differentiated by CsCl gradient centrifugation of BrdUMP density-labeled DNA, was used to examine the effects of the polymerase inhibitors. Another approach investigated the effects of several of these inhibitors on MNNG-induced DNA repair synthesis in intact cells by measuring the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into repaired DNA as determined by autoradiography and quantitation with an automated video image analysis system. In permeable cells, MNNG-induced DNA repair synthesis was inhibited 56% by 50 micrograms of aphidicolin/mL, 6% by 10 microM BuPdGTP, 13% by anti-(DNA polymerase alpha) monoclonal antibodies, and 29% by ddTTP. In intact cells, MNNG-induced DNA repair synthesis was inhibited 57% by 50 micrograms of aphidicolin/mL and was not significantly inhibited by microinjecting anti-(DNA polymerase alpha) antibodies into HF nuclei. These results indicate that both DNA polymerases delta and beta are involved in repairing DNA damage caused by MNNG.", "PMC2771897": "The placenta from 30 women with diabetes mellitus were examined and weighed at delivery. Nineteen of these were from women with overt and eleven from women with gestational diabetes. Eleven placentae from normal pregnancies served as controls. There was no difference between the mean +/- s.d. placental weight for the diabetic group and the control group (609 +/- 148 versus 591 +/- 93 g, NS). The mean placental weight ratios for the diabetic group and the control group were also similar (0.98 +/- 0.23 versus 0.89 +/- 0.15, NS). Moreover, there was no difference between the weights and weight ratios of placentae from women with overt (622 +/- 173 g, 1.02 +/- 0.27) and those with gestational diabetes (586 +/- 90 g, versus 0.90 +/- 0.13). Placental weights correlated with birthweights (r = 0.70, P less than 0.01) and with skinfold thickness measurements fo the infants (r = 0.40, P less than 0.05), but neither with gestational ages (r = 0.15, NS) nor with maternal glycosylated haemoglobin levels in the third trimester (r = 0.24, NS). Among the women with overt diabetes, placental weights were greater in those in White's class B and C than those in class D and R (689 +/- 143 versus 530 +/- 177 g; P less than 0.05).

Malonyldialdehyde, produced in vivo (endogenous malonyldialdehyde) or following in vitro exposure of cells to 10 mM H2O2 (H2O2 malonyldialdehyde), was used as a measure of peroxidant stress. After 5 weeks, the plasma cholesterol concentrations in rats receiving 1.2% cholesterol + 0.6% cholic acid in their diet rose to 6-times that of control rats receiving a diet without added cholesterol; at the same time, erythrocyte H2O2 malonyldialdehyde in the cholesterol-fed rats decreased significantly relative to the control rats. During subsequent exposure of both groups to in vivo peroxidant stress with phenylhydrazine in two separate dose trials, erythrocyte peroxidant stress remained significantly lower in the cholesterol-fed rats: at a dose of 100 mumol/100 g body weight, H2O2 malonyldialdehyde was lower; at a dose of 25 mumol/100 g body weight, both endogenous and H2O2 malonyldialdehyde were lower. Erythrocyte membrane cholesterol concentrations were 12% higher in the cholesterol-fed rats than in controls. The effects of in vivo peroxidant stress on plasma cholesterol were also studied. In vivo peroxidant stress at the higher dose of phenylhydrazine produced a decrease in plasma cholesterol concentrations of control rats. The lower dose had no effect on this group and the plasma cholesterol concentrations were unchanged in the cholesterol-fed rats during both treatments. The data suggest that elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations are protective against erythrocyte peroxidant stress. The mechanism of cholesterol's protective effect is probably mediated through elevated membrane cholesterol concentrations.", "PMC3208557": "The effects on vocabulary acquisition of child-initiated versus adult-initiated instances of adult labeling were studied. 16 monolingual, English-speaking preschool children were exposed to a Spanish-speaking adult. In order to have access to toys placed out of their reach, children had to request the toys in Spanish. For the experimental group, adult labeling occurred when the children expressed interest in the toy. Control group children were yoked temporally to experimental group children for the purpose of adult labeling. Thus, adult labeling for the control group was randomly related to the children's expressions of interest. Although both groups of children learned some Spanish words, children in the experimental group produced significantly more Spanish words during the training sessions and showed superior performance on posttraining tests of Spanish production. Levels of comprehension of the Spanish words were equivalent for both groups.

Moderate sensitivity in the determination of these pseudo-glucoses dissolved in human serum was obtained by GLC (0.1 nmol) and HPLC (0.5 nmol). The colorimetric determination with glucose 2-oxidase, peroxidase, and 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) was satisfactory for the assay of pseudo-alpha- and pseudo-beta-DL-glucose (respective sensitivities: 25 and 5 nmol). The addition of hexokinase to the colorimetric assay system made it possible to eliminate glucose present in the sample, such as serum, and the remaining pseudo-alpha- or pseudo-beta-DL-glucose in the sample solution could then be measured by a colorimetric method using glucose 2-oxidase. The methods described can be used for biochemical studies involving pseudo-alpha- and pseudo-beta-DL-glucose.", "PMC2217200": "Protein prenylation with farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties is an important posttranslational modification that affects the activity of such diverse proteins as the nuclear lamins, the yeast mating factor mata, and the ras oncogene products. In this article, we show that whole retinal cultures incorporate radioactive mevalonic acid into proteins of 23-26 kDa and one of 8 kDa. The former proteins are probably the \"small\" guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) and the 8-kDa protein is the gamma subunit of the well-studied retinal heterotrimeric G protein (transducin). After deprenylating purified transducin and its subunits with Raney nickel or methyl iodide/base, the adducted prenyl group can be identified as an all-trans-farnesyl moiety covalently linked to a cysteine residue. Thus far, prenylation reactions have been found to occur at cysteine in a carboxyl-terminal consensus CAAX sequence, where C is the cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is undefined. Both the alpha and gamma subunits of transducin have this consensus sequence, but only the gamma subunit is prenylated. Therefore, the CAAX motif is not necessary and sufficient to direct prenylation. Finally, since transducin is the best understood G protein, both structurally and mechanistically, the discovery that it is farnesylated should allow for a quantitative understanding of this post-translational modification.", "PMC3373609": "Bowenoid papulosis of the penis is a recently described entity that clinically resembles benign verruca-like papular lesions but, histologically, it is identical to carcinoma in situ, Bowen's disease or erythroplasia of Queyrat.

We have found a new operation, which we call extended deep femoral angioplasty, to be effective not only in some cases where bypass is possible but also in many cases where it is impossible because of a poor run-off, lack of a suitable vein, or even when a bypass has failed. In a consecutively treated group of 34 patients operative reconstruction was limited to the deep femoral artery and a success rate of 65% was achieved. Most gratifying was the saving of a leg in eight patients in whom bypass was impossible.", "PMC2224625": "Ascitic fluid opacification on delayed intravenous contrast computed tomography scans was observed in eight consecutive patients imaged.

The patients were classified into four stages of malignancy and three metastatic categories. High Mg levels were found in plasma and whole blood of patients in the early stages of stomach cancer, while low Ca levels were found in blood plasma in most stages and in all metastatic groups. By contrast, high Ca levels were observed in whole blood in the later malignancy stages and in two of the metastatic categories.

In all cases the echocardiographic findings concerning diastolic thickness of the free wall of the left ventricle were studied as well as their relation ship to several electrocardiographic criteria mentioned in literature as indicative of left ventricle hypertrophy. The sensitivity, specificity and precision were calculated for each EKG criterion. The electrocardiographic criteria in general are little sensitive, highly specific and very variable in its accuracy. The most sensitive criteria found as indicative of left ventricle hypertrophy were the T positive wave in V1 higher than the T in V6 and the intrinsecoid deflection time inscription higher than 0.04 sec.", "PMC3760879": "The latex of Euphorbia tirucalli originating from Madagascar contains as irritant constituents ingenane- and tigliane-type diterpene esters derived from the parent alcohols ingenol and phorbol. The main irritant constituents are isomeric 12,13-acetates, acylates of phorbol as well as 3-acylates of ingenol. As acyl groups, they carry homologous, highly unsaturated aliphatic acids of the general structure CH3-(CH2)m-(CH = CH)n-COOH (m = 2,4; n = 2,3,4,5; total number N of C-atoms = 2n + m + 2). The lack of 4-deoxyphorbol esters in this latex as compared to latex of South African origin is probably indicative of the existence of chemical races of E. tirucalli. In the acyl moiety of phorbol esters investigated in detail, an increasing number of C-atoms or an increasing number of double bonds at a fixed number of C-atoms leads to an increase of irritant activity. As compared to their saturated analogs, corresponding unsaturated phorbol esters exhibit similar irritant activities. On the other hand, by an increasing number of conjugated double bonds in the acyl moieties of phorbol esters, the promoting activity is decreased, thus indicating that irritant activity is a necessary, but insufficient, requirement for promoting activity of phorbol esters. An assessment of a potential carcinogenic risk involved in mass production and handling of the plant should point to the very weak tumor-promoting activity and the chemical instability demonstrated for the diterpene constituents in the latex and hence in all plant parts.", "PMC3546078": "A mentally retarded male was found to be homozygous for a paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 12(inv(12)(q21.1q23.2].

Patients were randomly assigned to receive sucralfate (n = 11) or placebo (n = 12) for six weeks. Then all received six weeks of open sucralfate therapy before treatment codes were revealed. Twelve gastric biopsy specimens were obtained before patients began treatment and at six and 12 weeks. The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to symptom scores or endoscopic findings at baseline, after the double-blind phase, or after open sucralfate treatment. There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups with respect to epithelial cell scores and conventional gastritis scores. However, after the six-week, double-blind phase, the inflammatory cell score of the sucralfate-treated group was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that of the placebo-treated group (1.3 +/- 0.3 versus 1.9 +/- 0.4). After six weeks of open sucralfate treatment, patients who had initially received placebo had a significant reduction (1.4 +/- 0.3 versus 1.9 +/- 0.4) in their inflammatory cell score. Sucralfate lowered the inflammatory cell scores of patients with symptoms of alkaline reflux gastritis.

The time course of these neurochemical changes was examined in several serotonergic nerve terminal regions of the brain. Fifteen min after subcutaneous injection of MDMA (10 mg/kg), the enzymatic activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of serotonin) was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex; by 1 hr after the injection, the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase had significantly declined in the neostriatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus as well. Although extensive recovery had occurred by 2 weeks, the activity of the enzyme remained significantly depressed in most regions. Decline of the regional content of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) closely paralleled, but was usually preceded by, that of the enzyme. Concentrations of the primary metabolite of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were less responsive: in most regions levels of 5-HIAA had significantly decreased by 3 hr, but not by 1 hr, following treatment. Markers of dopamine function were altered transiently but had returned to control values by 24 hr. Administration of multiple doses of MDMA (5 doses over a 24-hr period) resulted in significant decreases in serotonergic parameters for up to 110 days after treatment. The rate and extent of recovery varied according to both the dose administered and the region examined. The persistence of these serotonergic deficits suggests that MDMA induced the destruction of serotonin-containing axon terminals.", "PMC3411681": "Spontaneous rupture of the kidney or collecting system during pregnancy is an unusual condition.

Ant-dATP competitively inhibited both bacterial enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli (ki approximately 10 microM). Binding of the analogue to adenylate cyclase was monitored by equilibrium dialysis and by an increase in its fluorescence emission at 420 nm upon excitation at 330 nm. Whereas the fluorescence of Ant-dATP was little influenced by divalent cations, CaM, or adenylate cyclase alone, the Ca2+.CaM.cyclase complex increased up to 4 times the quantum yield of Ant-dATP. Binding of the analogue to the catalytic site of BPCYA47 and BACYA62 was specific as shown by its displacement with ATP or 3'-dATP. Our results substantiate the role of CaM in favoring substrate binding to CaM-activated enzymes.", "PMC3007457": "In the absence of ribosomal particles, elongation factor G (EF-G) promotes very little GTP hydrolysis. After the addition of some aliphatic alcohols to EF-G, the rate of nucleotide cleavage was significantly increased and GTPase activity was easily detectable. The highest stimulation, nearly 16-fold, occurred with 2-propanol at a 20% (v/v) concentration. The reaction showed the characteristics of an enzymatic catalysis, but the rate was three orders of magnitude lower than that of the ribosome-dependent EF-G GTPase activity. Striking similarities between the two activities indicated that the catalysis stimulated by the alcohol was due to EF-G itself. We found that EF-G GTPase activity in the presence of 2-propanol displayed an absolute specificity for GTP as in the presence of ribosomes; the two activities copurified to a constant ratio and exhibited coincident chromatographic and electrophoretic patterns; the temperature for the half-inactivation of EF-G was 59.3 degrees C for both GTPase systems, as well as the kinetic constant for the thermal inactivation process which was found to be 0.05 min-1; and the Km for the GTP in the presence of 2-propanol (59 microM) was similar to that found in the presence of ribosomes. These results indicate that the EF-G molecule carries a catalytic site for GTP hydrolysis, which in the absence of ribosomal particles is activated by an appropriate alcohol/water surrounding medium.", "PMC2173329": "In a fine structural and immunocytochemical study, the latter performed on semithin sections of epoxy resin embedded skeletal muscle fibers, three types of cytoplasmic bodies were identified in a case of cytoplasmic body myopathy: (1) The first type, the classical type, showed a central core and a light halo with radiating actin filaments at the periphery. (2) The second type, the spheroid body was characterized by irregularly arranged granular masses associated with intermediate filaments. Desmin immunoreactivity occurred in the central and peripheral parts, where filaments of intermediate size were visualized by electron microscopy. Desmin immunoreactivity was noted also at the Z-bands of striated annulets, within areas of disordered myofibrils, such as sarcoplasmic masses, and in atrophic muscle fibers. (3) The third type of the cytoplasmic body was composed mainly of large masses of uneven granularity and electron density. The center of this type reacted to anti-actin antibody suggesting that the 5- to 6-nm filaments, which ultrastructurally proved to be a major component, were of the actin type. By contrast, neither intermediate filaments nor actin microfilaments were found by electron microscopy in cytoplasmic bodies in a second case where no immunoreaction to desmin or actin occurred. Anti-vimentin antibody stained only the cytoplasm of endomysial cells, but not the inclusion bodies. Some other, unusual inclusions with 18- to 20-nm tubulo-filamentous structures have to be distinguished from the various types of filaments in cytoplasmic bodies. It is concluded, that pleomorphism and heterogeneity of \"cytoplasmic bodies\" have to be taken into consideration when classifying cytoplasmic body myopathies.", "PMC2572193": "Atherosclerosis and its consequences are a significant cause of death in industrialized countries. In recent years, due to modern techniques which permit DNA analysis, a series of alleles associated with dyslipoproteinemia and heart disease have been identified. In this study these genetic markers, in particular those found at the level of the genes of apolipoproteins, are reviewed. The knowledge of these facts is important for the paediatrician, since these disturbances can be identified in the first days of an individual's life, thus a positive influence can be made over the lifestyle habits.", "PMC3120848": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in 14 patients before carotid endarterectomy, 3 h after surgery and 2 days postoperatively using the intravenous xenon-133 technique. In 11 of the patients CBF was remeasured at 6 months and in 8 patients CBF and the response to hypercapnia (5 per cent CO2 in air) was measured pre-operatively and 6 months following surgery. All operations were performed using an intraluminal Javid shunt and internal carotid artery (ICA) 'stump' pressure was recorded. CBF measured at 3 h after endarterectomy revealed a postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion with significantly increased flows in both hemispheres. There was a significant correlation between carotid cross clamping time and ipsilateral hemispheric CBF increase which implied an ischaemic aetiology for the hyperperfusion and supported the routine use of an intraluminal shunt in carotid endarterectomy. Six months after surgery, CBF had returned to its preoperative value but reactivity to CO2 was significantly improved, which suggested that the operation had increased cerebral reserve.", "PMC3093673": "Phorbol esters activate protein kinase C and induce contraction in vascular smooth muscle. The role of Ca and the sensitivity of this response to nitrovasodilators were evaluated in rabbit aortic rings. Phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) (0.01-10 microM) elicited a concentration-dependent contraction of rabbit aortic rings. Responses to PDB in a salt solution (SS) containing 2.54 mM CaCl2 were not significantly different from those in SS containing 0 Ca and 2 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. Contractions to PDB (1 microM) in zero Ca SS were not reduced by depletion of the norepinephrine-sensitive pool of intracellular Ca. The Ca entry blockers verapamil (100 microM) and nifedipine (100 microM) did not affect PDB (1 microM) responses. Nitroprusside (0.1-10 microM) and nitroglycerin (0.1-10 microM) inhibited PDB contractions in both normal SS and Ca-free SS. 8-Br-cyclic GMP (100 microM) also inhibited PDB responses. Effects of PDB on 45Ca fluxes were evaluated in separate experiments. PDB (1 and 10 microM) elicited contraction, but no change in 45Ca uptake or efflux. In contrast KCl (80 mM) and norepinephrine (10 microM) elicited an increase in both influx and efflux, reflecting a rise in cytosolic Ca. The data suggest that PDB-induced contractions in rabbit aorta are independent of extracellular Ca and are not associated with a rise in cytosolic Ca as detected by calcium flux studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2764445": "Three cases of pituitary adenoma with extension into the nasopharynx and nasal cavity are reported. The occurrence of this rare tumor underscores the need to consider a pituitary tumor whenever a patient presents with rhinologic complaints and destruction of the sellar floor. Epistaxis, although exceptional, may be the first manifestation of a pituitary tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis combined with staining for the pituitary hormones proved to be essential for reaching a definite diagnosis.

The accumulation of fat droplets in myocardial fibers following brain infarction was measured by electron microscopic morphometry and expressed as a percentage of the area of the sarcoplasm. GHB treatment significantly reduced the area occupied by lipid droplets compared with that found in saline treated controls measured both 10 hours (p less than .005) and 24 hours (p less than 0.05) after unilateral carotid ligation.

Students were surveyed during class on successive days. On a subsample (n = 44), the agreement between reported and observed physical activities during physical education or recess was 86.3%. Running, walking fast, games and sports, and bicycling accounted for 70% of Total MVPAs. Of Total MVPAs reported, 47.0% for boys and 44.6% for girls were 10 min or longer in duration (LMVPA). The average number of LMVPAs per day was 1.7 for both boys and girls. Students reported significantly more occurrences of LMVPAs out of school than during school. Significant interaction between grade and gender indicated that third grade boys reported more Total MVPAs and LMVPAs than third grade girls, but fourth grade boys reported fewer Total MVPAs and LMVPAs than fourth grade girls reported fewer Total MVPAs and LMVPAs than fourth grade girls. During the 3-day reporting period, 12.3% of boys and 13.3% of girls reported no LMVPAs, and 35.6% of boys and girls reported fewer than one LMVPAs per day. While the majority of children reported obtaining at least some activity daily, a substantial proportion of children in this sample reported fewer than one LMVPA daily, indicating that many children may not be obtaining adequate amounts of physical activity.", "PMC3001439": "Although considerable advances have been made in the understanding of Cushing's syndrome in the recent past, many difficulties persist in the diagnosis and management of patients with hypercortisolism. Precision in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and the differentiation of its various forms have gradually improved, but a substantial number of cases have laboratory or radiologic findings that can be misleading or at least difficult to interpret. Furthermore, other conditions may mimic Cushing's syndrome and add to the diagnostic difficulties. Surgical extirpation of primary adrenal lesions that cause the hypercortisolism or of the neoplasms responsible for the ectopic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone remains the treatment of choice for these problems. Currently, transsphenoidal surgical exploration is the treatment of choice for Cushing's disease.", "PMC2140170": "Eleven patients (5 men and 6 women) with sickle-cell anaemia were treated with systematic repeated blood transfusions to avoid the sickling crises and complications of the disease and were followed up for 5 to 10 years. On average, the patients received 22 erythrocyte concentrates per year, to a mean individual total of 180 sediments. Each blood transfusion was accompanied by an intravenous infusion of deferoxamine 2 grams. Systematic blood perfusions unquestionably had beneficial effects on the frequency of sickling crises and complications, as well as on the patients' quality of life and psycho-social status. On the other hand, the iron overload could not be avoided, and it sometimes resulted in haematochromatosis (2 patients). At the moment, only continuous deferoxamine infusions could prevent this from happening and enable blood transfusions to be more widely used, provided its indications, restricted to the most severe forms of the disease, are carefully weighed. In this series of patients, the risk of viral contamination seemed to be relatively low, and in particular no HIV seroconversion was detected.", "PMC2790901": "A twelve-day reducing regime involving exercise and a reducing diet (2.5 MJ/day), led in 23 obese women to an average loss of body weight of 4.52 +/- 0.35 kg. The loss of adipose tissue during the reducing regime was greater than the total loss of body weight, obviously due to proliferation of lean body mass as a result of exercise. Concurrently a significant decline of the mean morning concentration of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, C-peptide and STH in serum was recorded, while the concentration of TSH, cortisol, prolactin, LH and FSH increased insignificantly and the concentration of insulin and testosterone declined insignificantly. Exercise thus did not prevent a decline of triiodothyronine induced by the low energy diet. The exercise in the morning did not cause a stress conditioned increase of the secretion of cortisol, prolactin and STH at the onset and at the end of the reducing regime. From the metabolic aspect the favourable absence of the stimulating action of exercise on cortisol secretion is due to the character of motor activity (40-50% VO2max). The absence of a stress conditioned rise of prolactin during exercise prevents the inhibiting action of prolactin on gonadal functions. The reducing regime has also a favourable effect on insulin secretion, as on the 12th day of the reducing regime there was a significant decline of the serum level of immunoreactive insulin in the course of exercise.", "PMC3141347": "During a hospital outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), involving more than 200 patients, 40 patients and 32 hospital staff who were stable nasal carriers of MRSA received topical application of 2% mupirocin, formulated in a white soft paraffin and lanolin ointment, to their anterior nares for five days. Nasal carriage was eliminated in all patients and staff, usually within the first 48 h of treatment. Of the 40 patients, 36 remained clear of nasal MRSA for the duration of their follow-up (mean = 2 weeks) and four became re-colonized one to five weeks after their course. Immediately after the course, the number of patients with MRSA isolated from wounds and wrists fell from 16 to 7, and from 16 to 3, respectively. Of the 32 staff, all were negative one week after the course, and of the 22 still available for follow-up at eight weeks, all were consistently negative (mean period of follow-up = 7.8, range = 1-20 weeks). Four patients and five staff were re-colonized with MRSA between one to five, and two to twelve weeks, respectively, after treatment. Overall, in the post-treatment follow-up, 98.6% of the staff-weeks and 90.1% of the patient-weeks were free of nasal MRSA. MICs of mupirocin for both pre and post treatment isolates were all 0.03 or 0.06 mg/l. The elimination of nasal MRSA by mupirocin, and the introduction of isolation facilities, were associated with the control of the outbreak.", "PMC2136918": "The bicycloannulation reaction between cyclohexenone and indolyl enamines yields trans-3-(cyclic amino)-2-(3'-indolyl)bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-5-ones, and these adducts are conformationally restricted analogues of indolylethylamine (tryptamine) which exhibit structure-dependent affinity for the serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT1a receptors. The stereochemistry of the isomeric endo and exo adducts obtained is assigned from the 1H NMR spectra of the specifically deuterated alkenes prepared from the ketones by the Bamford-Stevens reaction. Molecular mechanics calculations indicate that the conformational flexibility of the amino and indolyl groups is restricted through van der Waals interactions with the bridges of the bicyclic unit. These compounds inhibit the binding of [3H]ketanserin to 5HT2 sites in mouse cerebrocortical membranes, and the binding of [3H]-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]-8-OH-DPAT) to 5HT1a sites in mouse hippocampal membranes. The endo compounds are the most potent, and molecular mechanics calculations indicate that these isomers have a less bulky bicyclo bridge proximate to the amine group and more conformational freedom about the C alpha-C beta-N(+)-H dihedral angle (tau 3). In the 5HT2 assay, endo-trans-3-(N-piperidinyl)-2-(3'-indolyl)bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-5-one (10a) is the most potent, and endo-trans-3-(N-pyrrolidinyl)-2-(3'-indolyl)bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene (12a) is the most potent in the 5HT1a assay. A phenyl-substituted adduct shows the least affinity in these two assays. These data provide insight into the structural differences between the 5HT1a and 5HT2 receptor sites.", "PMC2979607": "The existence of idiotypic networks, first postulated over 12 years ago, is now widely recognised. Idiotypic analyses of autoantibodies have been reported among both hybridoma-derived and naturally occurring immunoglobulins. In this review the many studies of idiotypes detected on anti-DNA antibodies, notably one designated 16/6, are analysed to see what clues they offer to our understanding of autoimmunity. The links between infection and autoimmunity are emphasised by this analysis. It is also obvious that idiotypes first identified an autoantibodies are not confined to these immunoglobulins. Thus, the 16/6 idiotype originally described on a hybridoma-derived monoclonal anti-DNA antibody has also been identified on naturally occurring antibodies binding the Klebsiella polysaccharide K30.", "PMC3605090": "Renal fluoride toxicity in human beings is difficult to assess in the literature. Although experimental studies and research on methoxyflurane toxicity have shown frank renal damage, observations of renal insufficiency related to chronic fluoride exposure are scarce. We report a case of fluoride intoxication related to potomania of Vichy water, a highly mineralized water containing 8.5 mg/L of fluoride. Features of fluoride osteosclerosis were prominent and end-stage renal failure was present. The young age of the patient, the long duration of high fluoride intake, and the absence of other cause of renal insufficiency suggest a causal relationship between fluoride intoxication and renal failure.", "PMC2515849": "A glucuronyltransferase involved in glucuronoxylan biosynthesis was obtained from the epicotyls of 1-week-old etiolated pea (Pisum sativum var. Alaska) seedlings and was solubilized in Triton X-100, a non-ionic detergent. The enzyme was inactivated by SDS and inhibited by Derriphat 160 and cholic acid. The enzyme was active in the presence of NN-dimethyldodecylanium-N-oxide, but was not solubilized by it. The stimulatory effect of UDP-D-xylose on the particulate and solubilized enzymes was the same, but the optimum Mn2+ concentration was lower for the solubilized enzyme, and the product formed by the solubilized enzyme has altered structure and solubility properties. Gel filtration of the solubilized enzyme on Sepharose CL-6B permitted partial separation of the stimulatory effect of UDP-D-xylose from the activity in the absence of UDP-D-xylose. The solubilized enzyme was more stable than the particulate enzyme and could be stored for 2 weeks at -20 degrees C without loss of activity.", "PMC3213244": "This retrospective study aims to assess the efficacy of vesicostomy in the management of deteriorating upper renal tracts in patients with neuropathic bladders for whom intermittent self catheterization is not a clinical option. Between 1980-1987 vesicostomy was performed in 16 such patients (11 female, 5 male). Eleven had myelomeningocoele, 4 sacral anomalies and one cerebral palsy with scoliosis. All patients had urinary tract infections and deteriorating hydronephrosis and hydroureter (IVP, U/S); associated reflux in 13, impaired GFR in 4 and abnormal biochemistry in 8. The mean age at surgery was 3.3 years (8 mths. to 9 years). In all cases deterioration was arrested by vesicostomy. Fifteen patients showed structural or functional improvement and one stabilized. Late closure of the vesicostomy in two cases resulted in disimprovement of biochemical and radiological parameters. Acceptance of the vesicostomies was good. We advocate vesicostomy as an effective drainage procedure to preserve function in patients with neuropathic bladders and deteriorating renal tracts, in whom intermittent self catheterization is not a realistic alternative.", "PMC2940119": "Atrial tissue extract (AE) and ventricular tissue extract cause identical decreases in total peripheral resistance when they are injected i.v. into anesthetized rats. However, only AE causes significant hypotension because of cardiac inhibition. This involves both bradycardia and failure of stroke volume to increase appropriately. The observations cannot be explained by direct action of AE on myocytes, but are more likely to be the result of interactions with cardiovascular reflex mechanisms. Excitation of chemosensitive cardiac receptors with vagal afferents appears to be an important afferent mechanism. The efferent limb for the negative chronotropic response resides partly in the vagus nerves and partly in cardiac sympathetic nerves. The negative inotropic response of AE was not altered by vagotomy, spinal section, atropine, or propranolol. These results suggest that atrial peptides may cause the release of a negatively inotropic substance from a site that is not yet identified.", "PMC3720919": "The effect of calcium on cell proliferation and connective tissue formation was studied in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and dermal fibroblasts. Calcium deficiency caused a modest decrease in proliferation of smooth muscle cells but this effect was small compared to that previously observed with fibroblasts. Synthesis of connective tissue components was affected differently in the two cell types. Biosynthesis of proteoglycans was assessed by metabolic labeling of their glycosaminoglycan side chains. Different levels of extracellular calcium did not affect proteoglycan production by fibroblasts, but it was significantly reduced in smooth muscle cells incubated in calcium-deficient medium. Both smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts were able to produce appreciable amounts of collagen in the complete absence of calcium and in both cell types collagen synthesis was increased when calcium was present. Fibroblasts, however, showed a much smaller response to calcium than did smooth muscle cells. In fibroblasts the maximum rate of collagen synthesis was achieved in a narrow range of calcium concentration which was slightly below that found commonly in the tissue culture medium. By contrast, in smooth muscle cells the rate of collagen synthesis increased greatly when calcium was present and this elevated rate persisted even when the cells were exposed to high levels of extracellular calcium. We conclude that these findings may be of significance to the development of atherosclerotic lesions.", "PMC3896338": "The rates of utilization of both glucose and glutamine are high in rapidly dividing cells such as enterocytes, lymphocytes, thymocytes, tumour cells; the oxidation of both glucose and glutamine is only partial, glucose to lactate and glutamine to glutamate, alanine or aspartate; and these partial processes are termed glycolysis and glutaminolysis respectively. Both processes generate energy and also provide precursors for important biosynthetic processes in such cells. However, the rates of utilization of precursors for macromolecular biosynthesis are very low in comparison to the rates of partial oxidation, and energy generation per se may not be the correct explanation for high rates of glycolysis and glutaminolysis in these cells since oxidation is only partial and other fuels can be used to generate energy. Both the high fluxes and the metabolic characteristics of these two processes can be explained by application of quantitative principles of control as applied to branched metabolic pathways (Crabtree & Newsholme, 1985). If the flux through one branch is greatly in excess of the other, then the sensitivity of the flux of the low-flux pathway to regulators is very high. Hence, it is suggested that, in rapidly dividing cells, high rates of glycolysis and glutaminolysis are required not for energy or precursor provision per se but for high sensitivity of the pathways involved in the use of precursors for macromolecular synthesis to specific regulators to permit high rates of proliferation when required - for example, in lymphocytes in response to a massive infection.", "PMC3414925": "The safe use of electrical distribution boards in operating theatres is described, with particular reference to British Standard 5724.

At the start of the study, resting cardiac index, the heart rate, oxygen consumption (VO2) and mean arterial blood pressure were about 15% higher in those hypertensive patients aged 17-29 years than in the normotensives while the total peripheral resistance index was similar in both groups. During exercise, the stroke index decreased significantly and the total peripheral resistance index increased in the hypertensive group. After 10, and then 20 years, central haemodynamics were restudied in the hypertensive patients. The initially high cardiac index-low total peripheral resistance index pattern was reversed after 10 years. At the 20-year follow-up there was a further fall in the cardiac index and a more marked increase in the total peripheral resistance index at rest as well as during exercise. The study has shown a progressively abnormal haemodynamic pattern over two decades in young subjects with essential hypertension, characterized by a reduced cardiac function and excessive systemic vascular resistance.", "PMC4020749": "This paper reconsiders the evidence for underconsultation among the elderly. Earlier evidence from studies of unreported illness is reassessed and new data are presented for the ratio of self-reported illness to number of consultations. It is concluded that underconsultation among the elderly is exaggerated and that there are implications for screening and case-finding. It is suggested that attention should be directed towards a combination of self-referral and multi-tiered screening for low contact and high risk groups.", "PMC2225921": "Bladder cancer is largely a preventable disease; epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of cases occur as a result of cigarette smoking or occupational exposures. The impact of screening high-risk populations is uncertain, but prompt and early diagnosis is essential for optimal therapeutic results. The management of different stages of disease varies greatly and is currently in a state of evolution. The majority of cancers are superficial, of low malignant potential, and can generally be treated cystoscopically. Few studies have addressed whether intravesical therapy will prevent high-risk patients with superficial disease from developing muscle invasion or distant metastases. Controversy exists as to optimal management of patients with invasive cancers. Improvements in technique and methodologies of urinary diversion have made cystectomy more tolerable for patients. Although cystectomy remains the \"gold standard,\" probably not all patients require it. The careful selection of those patients whose bladders can be preserved is currently being evaluated. Combination chemotherapy for patients with metastatic bladder cancer is very active, appears to prolong survival, and may offer durable remissions to some patients. Whether chemotherapy will permit greater numbers of patients with invasive bladder cancer to be cured and bladders preserved remains to be determined.", "PMC2259351": "It has been suggested that sleep may have a positive effect on morning motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). We examined this possibility and also looked at common sleep disorders in PD. Seventy-eight PD patients and 43 normal elderly subjects answered a questionnaire. Of the PD patients, 43.6% reported improved motor symptoms in the morning, 37.2% worse, and 19.2% unchanged compared to the rest of the day. No difference was found between morning-better and -worse groups with respect to age, duration or stage of PD; antiparkinsonian medications utilized, and predominant motor symptoms. However, the morning-same group had a shorter duration of PD and less severe disease and required fewer dopaminergic medications. Sleep disorders were seen with equal frequency in the morning-better and -worse groups. Our results suggest that sleep does not have a direct effect on morning motor function. Alterations in morning motor symptomatology probably represent a manifestation of motor fluctuations. Sleep fragmentation and spontaneous daytime dozing occurred much more frequently in PD patients than controls. In addition, nocturnal vocalizations and daytime hallucinations occurred only in the PD group.", "PMC3238933": "Intensity of DNA and protein biosynthesis was decreased in Morris hepatoma 7777 cultivated cells in absence of thyroid hormones. Physiological concentrations of triiodothyronine increased synthesis of DNA and total proteins after lag phase within 12-48 hrs, while synthesis of nuclear and nuclear matrix proteins was stimulated already within 2 hrs. This suggests that stimulation of nuclear proteins biosynthesis occurred prior to the hormone effect on proliferation and cell metabolism. Alterations in sensitivity of chromatin to DNAase I were not observed. Response of the Morris hepatoma cells to thyroid hormones may be used in studies of molecular mechanisms of thyroid hormones action.", "PMC4030732": "In order to elucidate the physiological function of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, the characteristics of human intestinal alkaline phosphatase bound to brush border membrane vesicles were compared under optimal and physiological pHs. The Km value of this enzyme towards p-nitrophenylphosphate at the physiological pH was lower than that at the optimal pH. At the physiological pH, phosphate, arsenate and vanadate competitively inhibited the alkaline phosphatase activity, as they did at optimal pH, and the K1 values of these inhibitors at the physiological pH were also lower than those at the optimal pH. The effects of various inhibitors and antibody to human intestinal alkaline phosphatase on phosphate uptake into brush border membrane vesicles were investigated. The results indicated that phosphate uptake was affected by various inhibitors and the antibody to human intestinal alkaline phosphatase, but L-homoarginine, levamisole, and ouabain had no effect. From the above findings, it is strongly suggested that human intestinal alkaline phosphatase may function as a phosphate binding protein at low phosphate concentrations under physiological conditions.", "PMC4030980": "A simple and rapid high-performance liquid chromatographic assay is described for the simultaneous determination in serum of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone and its metabolites 7 alpha-thiomethylspirolactone, 6 beta-hydroxy-7 alpha-thiomethylspirolactone and canrenone.

Of 8 presumably identical polypeptides found variable in Japanese and/or Caucasians, differences in the occurrence or allele frequencies of polymorphisms were recognized for four.

Growth in the presence of lysozyme and sublethal concentrations of ampicillin partially opened the barrier. This could be recorded as an increased penetration of penicillin G, sodium cholate, and rifampin to their respective targets. Brief treatments with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium cholate effectively impaired the barrier against penicillin and also caused leakage of penicillinase. Wild-type E. coli K-12, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa also showed an increased sensitivity to cholate after treatment with penicillins. Electron micrographs showed that lysis by cholate was due to a distortion of the cytoplasmic membrane causing a leakage of protein and RNA from the cells to the medium. Physiological data indicated that the increased sensitivity to cholate induced by growth in the presence of ampicillin or lysozyme was due to effects upon the murein. This was supported by measurement of the incorporation of (3)H-diaminopimelic acid. These results indicate that the murein sacculus either is a part of the penetration barrier or is responsible for holding the structure of the outer membrane together.", "PMC4629650": "Impurities believed to be polysaccharides have been found in mycobacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) preparations.

The presence of the contaminants was found to affect markedly the determination of the guanine plus cytosine content according to a method dependent on the ratio of absorbancies at 260 and 280 nm; the impurities did not affect the determination by the method of thermal denaturation.

It is proposed that these are subunits, or core aggregates, of the large primary aggregates. Counts of the core aggregates can be taken as a precise and accurate measure of aggregation. Experiments based on this procedure show that the aggregation of S. sanguis is maximal at 10 C and at 1 meq of Ca(2+) ions per liter and is not affected by a change in pH between 3.9 and 8.7 or by a change in the phase of growth of the microorganisms. Core aggregates diminish in number with prolonged incubation, suggesting that the aggregating factors break down with time. Formalinized cells yield stable aggregates. However, with Formalinized cell aggregation is maximal between 20 and 30 C and proceeds in the absence of calcium ions. Evidence is presented that whole saliva contains separate aggregating factors for S. sanguis and S. mitis. The factors differ in their affinity for intact cells and for hydroxyapatite and differ in their stability to dialysis. These findings suggest that many different aggregating factors exist in saliva, each of which may be capable of interacting with cells of one or several bacterial species.", "PMC3688814": "The shortage of skin and soft tissue has been the limiting factor in many reconstructive problems. Tissue expanders (a temporary inflatable device) were recently introduced, to provide the solution. In the first 25 patients of our series of patients age 7 years to 46 years, a total of 30 expanders were used in different parts of the body. The expanders used were made by Cox-Uphoff (CUI) and varied in size from 30 ml to 1000 ml, with an attached remote valve. These expanders were placed subcutaneously, subfascially or submuscularly. Expansion was carried out as an outpatient procedure over a period of 6 weeks. 21 of the 25 patients underwent successful treatment. Failures were due to technical problems, extrusion of expanders, haematoma and infection. Tissue expanders are a new dimension in reconstructive surgery. They cause stretching of skin and soft tissues over a period of time and permit resurfacing of skin defects in difficult situations. Complications may be avoided with experience and further refinements in the construction of the expanders.", "PMC2666630": "The degree to which the family is seen as a significant contributor to child health conditions impacts directly on the successful functioning of the pediatric psychologist. A transactional model of family functioning is proposed for pediatric psychology. Development is considered to be the result of a three-part process that starts with child behavior that triggers family interpretation that produces a parental response. Family interpretation is presented as part of a regulatory system that includes family paradigms, family stories, and family rituals. Corresponding to the proposed three-part regulation model, three forms of intervention are discussed: remediation, redefinition, and reeducation. Clinical decision making based on this model is outlined with examples given from different treatment approaches.

The neonates with postoperative NEC had a median birth-weight of 3.05 (range 1.0-4.4) kg, and median gestational age of 40 (range 27-41) weeks. Twenty patients were treated non-operatively. The remaining 13 required operation for complications of NEC. Twenty-three patients are alive and have been followed for a median of 66 (range 3-168) months.

These phospholipids were excreted into the culture medium, and were replaced in the cell with newly synthesized phospholipids. Phospholipids of growing cells supplemented with elaidic acid underwent rapid turnover, while those of cells supplemented with oleate, or cis-vaccenate plus palmitoleate, underwent slow turnover. Starvation for required amino acids stimulated this turnover in the latter two cases. Protein was also lost from growing cells. However, after amino acid starvation this loss ceased while phospholipid turnover continued.

Localized allergic responses to C. albicans or other allergens may contribute to the pathogenesis of recurrent vaginitis in sensitized women.", "PMC2873824": "Patients with allergic diseases are characterized by the presence of elevated serum IgE and specific IgE antibodies against a variety of environmental allergens, especially house dust, mites and molds in Taiwan. A series of studies on allergic asthmatic children have been conducted to explore the non-immunological and immunological causes for their augmented production of IgE antibody and to explore the working mechanisms of hyposensitization. The results showed that the patients had multiple defects in their defects in their defense mechanisms, including hyper-permeability of mucosae, hyperreactivity of target organs, defective phagocyte functions, and deficient helper and suppressor T-cell functions. Hyposensitization was able to partially correct the immunological aberrations. More over, a newly found lymphokine termed \"T-cell growth factor\" or \"interleukin 2\" may be used not only as an indicator for the initiation and termination of hyposensitization, but may also provide a promising tool for the treatment of allergic diseases in the future because of its capability of enhancing and expanding allergen-specific suppressor T cells.", "PMC4982198": "Bacillus subtilis 168 thyA, thyB cells degrade and lose from 20 to 30% of their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in 3.5 hr of exposure to 20 mug of nalidixic acid per ml.

In Phodopus sungorus the frequency and characteristics of daily torpor were not affected by a decrease in temperature. The seasonal cycle of daily torpor is essentially under photoperiodic control. 2. Testicular regression is a necessary condition for daily torpor occurrence. Testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone administration totally inhibited daily torpor in hamsters which were exposed to short days. The temporal inhibition of torpor by steroids had no effect on the seasonal time measuring mechanism governing daily torpor. 3. Castration influenced certain aspects of the daily torpor display. Castrated hamsters showed a delay in terminating torpor season lending further support to the hypothesis that recrudescence of the testis plays a role in terminating the daily torpor season. Castration, when performed before or on the day of transfer to short photoperiod led to an increase in the frequency of torpor bouts and reduce SP exposure duration which is necessary for the daily torpor season beginning.", "PMC3515212": "By method of light and electron microscopy the influence of heparin (0.1%) sodium heparinate) on Zajdela ascites hepatoma cells was studied. To provide penetration of heparin into cells, the latter were treated with low-concentration detergent--Triton X-100. Heparin causes increase of cells observable by phase-contrast method, and homogenization of the karyoplasm. When examining stained preparations light-optically, chromatin is distributed evenly and structurelessly over the whole cell. Streaks of DNA-containing material protrude into the cytoplasm. Electronograms show lowering of electron density of cells, transformation of chromatin fibrils into a thin-fibrillar network, vanishing of nucleoli, and appearance of structureless globules about the size of 100 nm.

E. N., Duddy, S. K., and Orrenius, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15192-15198). Exposure of hepatocytes to the Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones, vasopressin, angiotensin II, or ATP following [Ca2+]i elevation by tBuBHQ produced a rapid return of [Ca2+]i to basal or near basal levels. Release of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pool by tBuBHQ following pretreatment with vasopressin or angiotensin II resulted in a [Ca2+]i transient and not the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation observed in the absence of the Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones. The G-protein activator, NaF plus AlCl3, mimicked both effects of the Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones on [Ca2+]i. The mechanism for Ca2+ removal from the cytosol by Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones did not involve cyclic nucleotides nor did it require protein kinase C activation or cyclo- and lipoxygenase-dependent metabolites of arachidonic acid. Furthermore, the hormone-mediated decrease in [Ca2+]i did not involve the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-protein. Removal of the tBuBHQ-mobilized Ca2+ from the cytosol of hepatocytes by Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones was mediated by stimulation of a Ca2+ efflux pathway. Thus, in addition to initiating [Ca2+]i transients by releasing Ca2+ from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ store and stimulating Ca2+ influx, Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones also regulate the termination of the [Ca2+]i transient by stimulating a Ca2+ efflux pathway.", "PMC3973705": "A simple method is described for checking the patency of ventriculoperitoneal shunts by using a pair of small disc thermistors. With this technique, shunt patency is shown by a downward deflection of the recording trace, blockage of the ventricular catheter is indicated by a flat-line recording, and obstruction of the distal end of the abdominal catheter is demonstrated by an upward deflection. These observations were confirmed in a study of 32 hydrocephalic patients with obstructed shunts who subsequently underwent shuntography and operation.

Cantharidine, with toxicity comparable to that of mustard gas, can be present in many species of coleoptera. It results in progressive corneal necrosis ending in ocular perforation in 30 days. The necrotic process persists with long duration because this material is not broken down. It provokes deep ocular injuries (cristalline lens). The inflammatory reaction is severe with acute refractory hypertension. There exists no antidote, only prevention is useful.

As compared to controls, in the HD striatum there was a significant loss of SYP immunoreactivity with residual staining displaying an inhomogeneous pattern, which strikingly resembled that of CaN. Our results may indicate that there is a synaptic loss in the striatum with HD and this is most likely due to loss of medium-sized spinous neurons characteristic of this disease.", "PMC3386277": "We investigated the in vitro effects (kinetics and dose-response) of adrenal and sexual steroid hormones on the secretion of thymulin, a thymic hormone, by human thymic epithelial cells in primary cultures as well as in a rat epithelial cell line. We demonstrated that all steroids tested, in a range of physiological doses, stimulated thymulin production to various extents. Progesterone and estradiol, however, were revealed to be the most efficient. Specific steroid antagonists abrogated the steroid-induced stimulation of thymulin production.

Endothelial rejection-free transplant survival in this group was compared to a retrospective historical control group of 199 consecutive transplants performed in recipients selected on the basis of age and longest wait criteria. The two groups were comparable with regards to primary diagnosis, preoperative corneal vascularization, donor and recipient age, and operative techniques. Thirty-eight transplants in the study group and 28 transplants in the control group were at high risk for endothelial transplant rejection. At 12 months, the estimated rejection-free survival (Kaplan-Meier method) of the high-risk study group transplants was 87% compared to 74% for the high-risk historical control group and transplants. This difference did not reach the significant level of 0.05 with the log-rank test. The 12-month estimated rejection-free survival of low-risk study group and historical control group transplants were similar. In the study group, the 12-month estimated rejection-free survival of well-matched transplants was 95% compared to 83% for poorly matched transplants (log rank, P less than 0.02).

The purified protein contained 25% carbohydrate by weight, the predominant sugars being galactose, mannose, and glucosamine. Amino acid analysis indicated that the protein was relatively rich in aspartate, glutamate, valine, and leucine and had a low proline and methionine content. The molecule could be removed from intact red blood cells by trypsin and could be labeled with iodine by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed cell surface iodination of red blood cells.

When the redox state of NADP is shifted to a more oxidized state, the steady-state level of Ca2+ in the medium increased and delta psi decreased in proportion to the mitochondrial NADP+ level.

The heterogeneous collection of cells with cytotoxic properties ranges from the phylogenetically primitive granulocyte and natural killer (NK) cell lineages to the more complex and versatile macrophage and antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte. Most killer cells are capable of the dual functions of cytotoxicity and immunoregulation. Granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells constitute an effective 'first line' cellular defence against invasive microbial pathogens and emerging malignancies. Through direct cytotoxicity or by the secretion of cytokines, NK cells also prevent overproliferation of precursor cell populations, thereby exerting a more discriminating control over antigen-specific T and B cell responses. The ultimate refinement of the killer cell is the cytotoxic T cell which is directed by an antigen receptor comparable in specificity and diversity to the immunoglobulin molecule. The mechanisms underlying the initial interaction between killer cell and target and the subsequent lytic event are imperfectly understood. Although many cytokines with lytic properties have been identified and in some cases cloned, their relative importance and intricate interactions with other components of the immune system are still largely unknown.

Pre- and postglomerular vascular resistances increased. RNS during prostaglandin inhibition (indomethacin) resulted in a 70% reduction in SNGFR, secondary to 1) a further diminution in delta P and in SNPF, via heightened pre- and postglomerular vasoconstriction and 2) a marked decline in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (LpA), from 0.058 +/- 0.006 to 0.027 +/- 0.002 nl.s-1.mmHg-1.g kidney wt-1 (P less than 0.005). Acute angiotensin II inhibition (MK-421 and [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II) in rats pretreated with indomethacin partially attenuated the effects of RNS on vascular resistances and therefore on delta P, SNPF, and SNGFR and prevented the reduction in LpA.

An alternative method for defining the range of orthodontic wires proposed by Waters (1981) is to wrap wire sections around mandrels of varying diameters and measure the deformation imparted after unwrapping. Four brass mandrels with a total of 46 test diameters ranging from 3.5 to 60.0 mm were used in this study. Wire sections 9 cm in length were rolled on the mandrel with a hand lathe. The mandrel cross section required to produce a predetermined amount of deformation (2 mm arc height for a 5 cm chord) was defined as the yield diameter for that particular wire. No individual wire was tested twice so as to avoid introduction of strain history. Test samples of 488 different orthodontic wires supplied by nine commercial distributors were evaluated (a total of 4,747 samples). Stainless steel wires of identical dimensions had a large variation in range, depending on the state of strain hardening and heat treatment.

The lesions persistently blocked the orienting response to visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli to both sides in all cats and produced other neurologic symptoms partially or totally recovered in some cats. The lesions significantly increased the number, amplitude, and contralateral propagation of type B EEG spikes and the occurrence, but not the duration, of type C EEG tonic-clonic discharges. Ipsi- and contralateral adversion of the tonic phase were completely blocked and the muscular contractions of the clonic phase were reduced and delayed. These facts suggest that in intact epileptic cats, the mesencephalic reticular formation has an ascending suppressive influence on the mechanism related to EEG spike generation and precipitation of seizures but also a descending facilitatory control on the corticospinal epileptic impulses mediated through pyramidal and extrapyramidal pathways.", "PMC1933439": "Intra- and extra-synaptosomal activity of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and -B (MAO-B), dopamine (DA) and its main metabolites were examined to clarify the mechanism of action(s) of p-hydroxyamphetamine (p-OHA) in animal behaviour mediated by central dopaminergic systems. Intrasynaptosomal DA was oxidized by MAO-A and MAO-B and this oxidation is inhibited by p-OHA. The inhibition is due to two effects: 1) uptake of DA is inhibited by p-OHA, and 2) p-OHA also inhibits intrasynaptosomal oxidation of DA by MAO-A and MAO-B. The inhibition of oxidation by MAO-A is predominant. Administration (ICV) of 80 and 160 micrograms p-OHA to mice, doses that cause various behavioural, significantly reduced striatal DA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels, but greatly increased 3-methoxytyramine, without significantly changing homovanillic acid (HVA). The release of DA and blockade of DA uptake into dopaminergic neurons by p-OHA, together with preferential inhibition of the DA metabolizing enzyme, MAO-A, may contribute to p-OHA-induced behaviour mediated by the central dopaminergic systems.", "PMC3991330": "Electrical potential difference, short circuit current, tissue conductance, and unidirectional Na-fluxes were measured in four segments of the rabbit large intestine in vitro. Compared to the relatively tight, low conductance distal colon, caecum and proximal parts of the colon are leaky epithelia with high conductances. Net Na-absorption was highest in caecum, and then decreased gradually towards the distal colon, whereas potential and short circuit current where high in the caecum and proximal colon, low in the middle part of the colon, and high again in the distal colon. Unidirectional Na-fluxes of all four segments were different. The discrepancy between the short circuit current and net Na-absorption in the two segments of the proximal colon indicates electrogenic transport of other ions. 0.1 mM ouabain virtually abolished short circuit current and Na-absorption in all segments, whereas 0.1 mM amiloride was not effective in the caecum and the proximal colonic parts. The present study focuses on the comparative aspects of Na-transport. It demonstrates the marked segmental heterogeneity of the basic electrical properties and suggests four different segmental organizations of large intestinal electrolyte transport.", "PMC1874647": "Modern medical technology has made available a complex array of testing methods for drugs of abuse.

The cell mediating the suppression was identified as a Thy 1+ Lyt 2+ I-J+ cell. The induction of this suppressor cell required the participation of at least three leukocyte populations. That is, depleting the cultures of either Lyt 1+ or Lyt 2+ splenocytes resulted in a failure to induce suppressor cell activity. Likewise the removal of macrophage-like antigen-presenting cells (APC), in particular I-A- I-J+ APC, abolished suppressor-cell induction. Though the Lyt 2+ I-J+ cells had to be provided by HSV-immune mice, both the APC and the Lyt 1+ cells could be provided by HSV-naive mice. Though the induction of the suppressor cell was virus specific, its action was nonspecific as evidenced by the suppression of influenza-specific CTL induction. The implication of our results for the understanding and manipulation of herpesvirus disease is briefly discussed.", "PMC3723500": "The much favoured ovalbumin antigen induced model of arthritis in rabbits is widely used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) research. When examined histologically, it was found to have important deficiencies as parallels to the human disease. After sensitization to ovalbumin, 2 intraarticular challenge doses of a magnitude at each end of the spectrum used by investigators were used in 152 rabbits. The effects of the high and low dose challenges were examined histologically with particular attention to the articular cartilage. With high doses, the gross and histological changes in the knee joint were remarkably akin to acute cartilage necrosis rather than RA1. In the low dose, a milder smoldering arthritis was produced. These observations suggest that, depending on the challenge dose used, there is a tremendous variability in the kind of arthritis produced by the antigen induced arthritis model. Furthermore, it is suggested that previous conclusions about the pathophysiology and immunology of RA drawn from the models that produce a rapid and severe arthritis should be reexamined.", "PMC4010294": "The drinking behavior and alcohol-induced facial flushing of 1646 Japanese men (50.9% flushers and 48.0% nonflushers) were analyzed from questionnaires completed by their wives.

Mab CF511 recognised the 600 kDa sialylated glycoprotein as different from previously known tumour associated-marker antigens. Distribution of the Mab CF511-recognised antigen (CF511 antigen) in various tissues and sera was investigated. In immunohistochemical analysis, Mab CF511 reacted strongly with tumour cells of ovarian serous, clear cell, endometrioid and undifferentiated carcinoma and partially with those of mucinous carcinoma. Mab CF511 also reacted with breast carcinoma as well as lung carcinoma. In normal tissues, Mab CF511 cross-reacted with only five tissues, namely lung, breast, thyroid gland, fallopian tube and uterus. Serum levels of CF511 antigen were tested by ELISA inhibition using Mab CF511. This assay showed the circulating CF511 antigen levels to be elevated in 25 of 36 sera from patients with various clinical stages of common epithelial ovarian carcinoma compared to three of 47 and three of 111 sera from patients with other benign gynaecological diseases, including ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids with or without endometriosis and normal healthy subjects, respectively. For the relation between antigen levels and clinical stages of common epithelial ovarian carcinoma, greater than 34.0% ELISA inhibition was detected in 100% of patients with advanced stages (FIGO III and IV) compared with in 35.3% with early stages (FIGO I and II) patients. While patients with breast carcinoma (100%) and lung carcinoma (100%) also had elevated circulating CF511 antigen levels, patients with hepatoma, colorectal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma had no detectable elevation of antigen. Although the test showed a high degree of specificity, the detection of an elevated CF511 antigen level would not be so helpful in distinguishing patients with ovarian carcinoma from those with either breast carcinoma or lung carcinoma. These data suggest that CF511 antigen is a useful new ovarian tumour marker for diagnosis and management of the disease.", "PMC2001213": "In-flight encounters with hazardous weather represent one of the most significant safety issues in civil aviation operations. Aircrew judgment is often cited as the probable cause of incidents and accidents involving weather, although lack of information is also a factor. The present study examines how information, presented at different times and in different forms, affects the awareness and decision-making behavior of aircrews in a flight simulation study of a recent microburst/windshear incident. In order to examine the influence of enhanced information transfer on aircrew behavior, intracrew communications and approach-to-land decisions were evaluated with conventional ATC communications and with automated cockpit alerting and display of weather information. Results of the study revealed that aircrews provided only with conventional ATC transmissions of weather information had difficulty discriminating conditions conducive to microburst events from less hazardous windshear events. Improved situation awareness for microburst events was found when ground-based convective weather information was provided in real time to aircrews. Avoidance decision-making was found to be less efficient with conventional ATC alert transmissions when compared to the performance of crews provided with a visual display of microburst events. The importance of information transfer on aircrew situation awareness and decision-making in hazardous weather avoidance is discussed.", "PMC2929236": "We have investigated the effect of gestational age and fetal hypophysectomy on the growth and development of the adrenal gland of the fetal sheep. The area of the fetal sheep adrenal medulla increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from 3.21 +/- 0.42 mm2 at 90-107 days to 6.09 +/- 0.26 mm2 at 120-126 days of gestation and there was a further significant increase (P less than 0.05) in the newborn period to 9.48 +/- 0.85 mm2. The adrenomedullary area of the hypophysectomised fetal sheep (7.47 +/- 1.10 mm2) was not significantly different from that of the fetal sheep at 140-146 days of gestation or from that of the newborn lamb. The ratio of the area of the adrenal occupied by the cells which contained adrenaline (adrenaline zone) to the area of the adrenal occupied by the cells which contained noradrenaline (noradrenaline zone) was unchanged between 90 days of gestation and 12 days after birth. After hypophysectomy, the ratio of the adrenaline to noradrenaline zone was not significantly different from that in the adrenal medulla of the 140-146 days fetal sheep and the 10-12 days newborn lamb.", "PMC3406046": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacology and pharmacodynamics of the thromboxane receptor antagonists, BM 13.177 and BM 13.505, for prevention of U 46619-induced sudden death in anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. The injection of U 46619 (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced sudden death typically between 5 and 15 min. Administration of 0.01 mg/kg BM 13.505 (i.v.) 0.1 h prior to the U 46619 challenge did not protect against sudden death, while doses of 0.03 mg/kg or greater protected completely (100% survival). A dose of 1 mg/kg BM 13.505 afforded protection to 2 h but not to 24 h, while a single dose of 30 mg/kg administered 24 h prior to the U 46619 challenge provided complete protection against the lethal event. Administration of BM 13.177 (30 mg/kg, i.v. or i.p.) blocked the effects of U 46619 when administered 0.1 h before the challenge, but not when given 2 or 3 h prior to the challenge with U 46619. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not block the effects of U 46619, indicating that formation of endogenous thromboxane does not play a major role in the lethal effects of U 46619, and that blockade of the lethal effects of U 46619 was specific for thromboxane receptor antagonists. These data demonstrate that BM 13.177 and BM 13.505 prevented sudden death produced by the injection of U 46619. At comparable doses of 30 mg/kg, the duration of action for BM 13.505 was was significantly greater than for BM 13.177. These data suggest that BM 13.177 and BM 13.505 may be useful for the investigation of diseases where thromboxane is involved.", "PMC3890587": "Sixty-three mainly male alcoholics were randomly assigned to placebo or lofexidine treatment for 48 hr shortly after admission to the hospital. Their starting points were similar regarding their semiquantitative estimates of alcohol withdrawal symptoms (AWS). Their demographics, histories of past alcohol use, physical findings, and laboratory abnormalities usually associated with alcoholism were similar. Starting 3 hr after 0.4 mg of oral lofexidine, which was given every 6 hr as eight doses, the AWS scores were significantly lower than those of the placebo group. Hypotension was the strongest finding. Six placebo recipients had to be prematurely interrupted due to increasing or intolerable alcohol withdrawal symptoms and switched to a benzodiazepine. Only one lofexidine recipient was prematurely interrupted, due to transient hallucinations. The study has a large placebo effect, as both groups of patients rated the treatment process very highly. Lofexidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, was superior to placebo in alcohol withdrawal.

We have reviewed the clinical and pathological features of 16 lymphoma-like lesions of the cervix (10 cases), endometrium (five cases), and vulva (one case) and compared these features with those of malignant lymphoma. One patient with a cervical lesion and one with a vulvar lesion had infectious mononucleosis. Microscopic examination of the lesions revealed an infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with prominent mitotic activity, including cleaved and noncleaved follicular center cells and immunoblasts; a starry-sky pattern was present in three cases. Plasma cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and small lymphocytes were present within the infiltrate in many of the cases. Immunohistochemical stains were performed in seven cases. In six they indicated the presence of polyclonal plasma cells; most of the atypical large cells did not stain for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. In the seventh specimen many immunoblasts had cytoplasmic staining of polyclonal type. The microscopic features of the lesions differ from those of lymphomas. Surface ulceration and intralesional acute inflammatory cells and plasma cells are rarely seen in lymphomas, while a large size, deep invasion, cellular monomorphism, and prominent sclerosis were not seen in the reactive lymphoma-like lesions. Follow-up of from 6 months to 12 years was available for 10 of the 16 patients, nine of whom were treated by procedures inadequate for the cure of malignant lymphoma, and has been uneventful in all of them. The clinical and pathologic features of these cases suggest that the atypical appearances in most of them resulted from a focally florid lymphoid proliferation in association with chronic cervicitis or endometritis, or a generalized disorder of lymphoid cells such as infectious mononucleosis.", "PMC2958478": "We report heterotopic chondro-ossification occurring in the hand of a young man in the absence of trauma.

However, this increased receptor abundance appears functionally dissociated from the GH gene since GH messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is decreased in S-phase cells. We have now examined a putative structural correlate of this dissociation by measuring the abundance of T3 and G receptors and the GH gene in the nuclear matrix (NM)/scaffold fraction. NM of control and S-phase cultures both contained 30-50% of G receptors. Thirty to 50% of T3 receptors were also localized to NM of asynchronous cultures, but T3 receptor abundance (femtomoles per 100 micrograms of protein) was significantly decreased in NM of S-phase cultures: Exp 1 (control, 140 +/- 6.2; S-phase, 56.5 +/- 0.8; Exp 2 (control, 170 +/- 12; S-phase, 105 +/- 2.4). Nuclear scaffolds were digested with restriction enzymes to solubilize DNA loop structures and probed with GH complementary DNA (cDNA) to examine the distribution of transcribed regions of the GH gene. EcoR1 digestion resulted in an 11 kilobase fragment including the reported regulatory sequences for T3 receptors. No specific differences in GH gene localization to nuclear scaffold were observed between asynchronous and S-phase cultures or in different hormonal states. Thus, GH gene localization to nuclear scaffolds was not correlated with changes in transcription induced by T3 and G hormones or position in the cell cycle. These studies suggest that decreased concentration of T3 receptors in the NM fraction of S-phase cultures may be a structural correlate for cell cycle regulation of T3 receptor function.", "PMC1488874": "The main objective of the study was to assess effects of long-term lowering of glucosylated hemoglobin (HbA1%) on neurosensory function in insulin-dependent diabetes. Individual (OP-1, OP-2, OP-3) and summed (OP-sum) amplitudes of oscillatory potentials (OPs) of electroretinography were recorded at study start and 7-years later in 45 patients (the Oslo study). As an overall 7-year change, amplitudes of OP-2, OP-3 and OP-sum were reduced (p < 0.0001-0.01), retinopathy worsened (p = 0.005), intraocular pressure decreased (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure increased (p < 0.0002), and glycemic control improved from HbA1 of 11.2 +/- 2.2% at study start to a 7-year cumulative mean of 9.5 +/- 1.5% (p < 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis did not identify any independent relations between change in OP-1, OP-2, OP-3, OP-sum and change in glycemic control or background variables, including change in age and duration of diabetes. However, cross-sectional observations at 7 years showed negative correlations between all OPs and age (p < 0.0001-0.003), and between OP-3 and duration (p = 0.003) and counts of microaneurysms (p = 0.02). The data suggest that various clinical background variables may influence individual and summed amplitudes of OPs differently.

In the present paper a combined anterograde HRP and immunocytochemical procedure has been used to determine the connectivity between these limbic efferents and peptide-containing processes emanating from the above mentioned hypothalamic nuclei. Synaptic associations were found to exist between efferents from (1) the septum and both vasopressin (VP)- and oxytocin (OX)-positive dendrites derived from cells in the PVN and SON, (2) the septum and VP dendrites dorsal to the SCN, (3) the ventral subiculum and both VP and OX dendrites arising from the PVN and SON, and (iv) the amygdala and VP dendrites from the PVN. These observations help clarify an apparent discrepancy between electrophysiological data, in which limbic efferents have been shown to influence the activity of VP and OX neurons in the PVN and SON, and anatomical evidence which indicates only a perinuclear innervation from these sites not encroaching on the hypothalamic nuclei themselves. In each case the synaptic connections are made on dendrites external to the nucleus: those lateral and ventrolateral to the PVN, dorsal to the SON, and dorsal or dorsolateral to the SCN.", "PMC3820164": "Inequality in function of the left and right ovaries and uterine horns of mice was evaluated in three separate experiments. In Exp. 1, the effect of position in the reproductive tract on various reproductive characteristics was evaluated in 158 pregnant hybrid mice. Ovulation rate, number of fetuses, total fetal weight and total placental weight were higher (P less than 0.05) on the right than the left on Day 18 of pregnancy (vaginal plug = Day 1). In Exp. 2, the effect of previous sham or unilateral ovariectomy (right or left) in mated Swiss-Webster mice was compared with unoperated mated controls (N = 17-24/treatment). In control mice, ovulation rate, total fetal weight and ovarian weight were higher (P less than 0.05) on the right than left side. Surgery (sham or unilateral, ovariectomy) decreased (P less than 0.005) ovulation rates, number of fetuses, ovarian weights, total fetal weight and total placental weight on Day 18 of pregnancy. Unilateral ovariectomy decreased (P less than 0.05) ovulation rates and ovarian weights more than did sham operation. Ovulation rates were higher (P less than 0.01) when the left ovary was manipulated or removed rather than the right ovary. For Exp. 3, pairs of 8 hybrid mouse embryos each (morulae and blastocysts) were surgically transferred to the left and right uterine horns of the same (bilateral, N = 15) or different (unilateral, N = 28) Swiss-Webster recipients. In almost all incidences, embryo survival (to Day 18 of pregnancy) was twice as high (P less than 0.05) in right than left uterine horns.

The increase and decrease on the prevalence indicate that the disease transmission has been increasing and decreasing in the respective foci.

Masking functions for all four combinations of chromatic and luminance masks and tests are reported. In the two same-on-same conditions (luminance mask/luminance test and chromatic mask/chromatic test) these functions (increment threshold contrast versus mask contrast) have the typical dipper shape and are almost identical when test and mask contrasts are normalized to the unmasked contrast thresholds. The contrast dependence of the luminance mask/color test and color mask/luminance test functions are quite different. The luminance mask/color test shows facilitation over a broad range of both subthreshold and suprathreshold contrasts of the luminance mask. In the color mask/luminance test condition facilitation is never observed, but at suprathreshold contrasts a 2-cycle/degree (c/deg) chromatic grating masks a 2-c/deg luminance grating as strongly as does a luminance mask. The luminance mask/chromatic test results are invariant over the 0.25-2-c/deg spatial-frequency range, whereas the robust masking of luminance by color at 2 c/deg diminishes at lower spatial frequencies. The spatial-frequency selectivity of the luminance-facilitates-color interaction is much broader than facilitatory interactions in either the color-color or luminance-luminance conditions. Possible mechanisms of color-luminance interactions are considered. The lack of facilitation in the color mask/luminance test condition precludes a simple pedestal interpretation of this masking interaction.

To further explore the mechanisms involved, we have utilized a model of short-term aluminium intoxication in the rat (total: 11 mg elemental aluminium in 3 weeks) to study (a) 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor status in a variety of classical and non-classical target organs for 1,25(OH)2D3; (b) circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 levels; (c) baseline duodenal calcium transport, utilising the Ussing chamber, to investigate the functional significance of receptor status in a classical target organ; and (d) duodenal calcium transport response to exogenously administered 1,25(OH)2D3. Both in the three week model and in the 16 week model (total: 41 mg elemental calcium) increased maximal specific binding capacity for 1,25(OH)2D3 (Nmax), that is, number of unoccupied receptors, was observed in nuclear fractions of all tissues studied. Receptor affinity, the apparent dissociation constant KD, was unchanged. Total binding capacity, measured after displacement of endogenous ligand by Mersalyl, that is, the sum of occupied plus non-occupied receptors, was also increased. Both circulating 1,25(OH)2D3, mucosa-to-serosa calcium flux (Jms) and net calcium flux (Jnet) were reduced under baseline conditions, suggesting the lack of a direct relationship between receptor expression and endorgan response. Following exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 administration, calcium Jms and Jnet were significantly lower in the aluminium intoxicated animals, with the increment induced in Jnet in aluminium intoxicated animals being 63% of that induced in controls.

In order to establish the immunohistologic parameters of this form of rejection, allografts and recipient lymphoid tissue were analyzed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies of known cellular distribution. These data were compared with those obtained following reconstitution of irradiated allograft recipients with unseparated sensitized spleen cells, with unreconstituted irradiated donor recipient pairs, with unmodified first-set rejection, and with induced myocardial infarction of syngeneic heart grafts transplanted to normal and to sublethally irradiated recipients. Rejecting cardiac allografts transplanted to all reconstituted irradiated recipients were characterized by extensive infiltration with MRC OX8+ (T cytotoxic-suppressor, natural killer) cells even when this subset was virtually excluded from the reconstituting inocula. A similar proportional accumulation of MRC OX8+ cells observed at the infarct margins of syngeneic heart grafts transplanted to irradiated unreconstituted recipients greatly exceeded that present in normal nonirradiated controls. These data provide evidence that under conditions of heavy recipient irradiation, MRC OX8+ cells may be sequestered within heart grafts in response to nonspecific injury unrelated to the rejection process. Although there was no significant degree of MRC OX8+ cellular repopulation within organized secondary lymphoid tissues of irradiated animals over the study period, the density of ileal mucosal MRC OX8+ lymphocytes approximated normal at 7 days post-irradiation, raising the possibility that these cells could share a common origin with those sequestered within the heart grafts. Carbon+ MRC OX6+ macrophages were a significant component of the infiltrate in all rejecting cardiac allografts, as well as in all infarcted syngeneic heart grafts--providing further evidence that macrophage \"activation\" with expression of class II determinants may occur in response to nonspecific injury. In unmodified first-set rejection there was an intense B cell reaction in recipient spleens and lymph nodes. In the adoptive transfer model, marked B cell expansion was exclusively confined to the parathymic lymph nodes of irradiated allograft recipients reconstituted with the sensitized W3/25+, MRC OX8-, SIg- T helper/DTH donor cell inocula.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC2836179": "The hormonal regulation of Na+-dependent phosphate transport was studied in opossum kidney (OK) cells. PTH caused time- and concentration-dependent decreases in Na+-dependent phosphate transport, with 10 pM PTH-(1-34) producing a 19% decline in phosphate transport. The EC50 for PTH inhibition of phosphate transport was 50 pM. Kinetic analyses of phosphate transport indicated that PTH decreased the maximum velocity without affecting the Km for phosphate. PTH increased cAMP formation with an EC50 of 10 nM. 8-Bromo-cAMP and (Bu)2cAMP also inhibited phosphate transport. Forskolin increased cAMP formation and decreased phosphate transport, whereas the cyclase-inactive forskolin analog 1,9-dideoxyforskolin also inhibited phosphate transport. The PTH analog [8,18-norleucine,34-tyrosinamide]PTH-(3-34) reduced phosphate transport at concentrations from 10 nM to 30 microM, but did not increase cAMP formation at concentrations up to 10 microM. The adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine produced concentration-dependent decreases in PTH-stimulated cAMP formation, but did not influence PTH inhibition of Na+-dependent phosphate transport. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and prostaglandin E1 increased cAMP formation in OK cells, but were weak inhibitors of phosphate transport. This study suggests that cAMP may not be the only transmembrane signaling mechanism involved in the regulation of Na+-dependent phosphate transport by PTH-(1-34) in OK cells.", "PMC2589308": "As part of a population-based case-control study carried out in four areas of the United States, 427 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed between July 1, 1977, and December 31, 1981, and 1,683 controls were interviewed regarding their history of chemical exposure. Respondents were asked if they had ever been \"highly exposed\" at home, at work, or elsewhere to one or more of a list of chemicals or to any other such substances not on the list. These chemicals were categorized into 20 exposure groups based on chemical composition. Odds ratios were calculated adjusting for age, sex, race, education level, and geographic location by means of unconditional logistic regression. Increased risks were associated with reported past exposure to acid-containing chemicals, \"other caustic substances,\" aliphatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated hydrocarbons.

Pronucleate mouse ova were frozen using an ultrarapid method in either 3.5 M dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), 3.5 M propanediol (PROH) or a 1:1 mixture of both. After a brief exposure to the cryoprotectant, they were plunged into liquid nitrogen. Thawing was done at 37 degrees C and the cryoprotectant was rapidly diluted in a sucrose solution. Pronucleate ova were slowly cooled in a biological freezer using 1.5 M PROH as cryoprotectant. Thawing was done at room temperature and PROH was removed by multi-step dilutions. As control groups, pronucleate ova were either given no treatment, or exposed to PROH or DMSO without freezing and cultured in vitro. Ultrarapid freezing using 3.5 M DMSO as cryoprotectant resulted in rates of survival, cleavage and post-thaw development to blastocysts of 85, 89 and 37%, respectively. PROH as cryoprotectant, however, was inadequate in the ultrarapid freezing protocol and the combination of DMSO and PROH showed no further improvement. Slow, programmed freezing (using PROH) compared to ultrarapid freezing (using DMSO) resulted in similar rates of survival, cleavage and development of 80, 84, 20% and 92, 81 and 23% respectively. In conclusion, DMSO is a better cryoprotectant than PROH for ultrarapid freezing of pronucleate mouse ova, and ultrarapid freezing with 3.5 M DMSO is as effective as slow freezing with 1.5 M PROH, as evaluated by their subsequent development in vitro.", "PMC2248717": "Eye prosthetics and its practitioners have evolved through self-development studies, to become an integral part of the ophthalmic plastic surgery multidisciplinary team.

Protein p4 binds to a region of the A3 promoter, located between nucleotides -50 and -100 relative to the transcription start site, that presents a sequence-directed curvature. This curvature is enhanced when protein p4 binds to the promoter. A number of deletion mutants at the carboxyl end of protein p4 have been constructed and their behavior as transcriptional activators of the late A3 promoter has been investigated. The binding of these deletion mutants to the late A3 promoter has been analyzed by gel retardation, DNase I footprinting, methylation interference and circular permutation assays. The results suggest that the last 12 amino acid residues of protein p4, six of which are positively charged, although not involved in the specific recognition of the promoter are responsible for part of the bend induced by protein p4 in its binding site. Evidence is presented which suggests that full induction of this curvature is needed for the transcription activation process. A model is proposed for protein p4 interaction with the A3 promoter, in which the bend is induced in two steps: first, two monomers of protein p4 bind to the inverted recognition sequences, subsequent interaction between them generating a bend between these sequences; second, the highly basic carboxyl terminus of protein p4 establishes non-specific electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone inducing a bend at both ends of the protein p4 binding region.", "PMC2983935": "The influence of the freeze-thawing rates on ATP synthetase (ATPase) complex of intact liver mitochondria was investigated. It was shown that the increase in latent ATPase activity and decrease in ATP synthetase activity resulted from an influence on the inner mitochondrial membrane. An increase in freeze-thawing rates led to the preservation of ATP synthetase activity and ATP hydrolysis reduction. Kinetic parameter changes of the ATP synthetase reaction resulted from an insignificant nonspecific increase in the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability and changes in its electrochemical potential level.", "PMC2854609": "The pharmacokinetic profiles of oral and sublingual administrations of prazepam 20 mg to 5 normal volunteers were compared in order to explain the clinical observation that sublingual prazepam appears to exhibit sedative properties when compared to the same dose of oral prazepam. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation were collected just before drug intake and 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30, 45, 60, 90 min, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 24 h after drug intake. The study was performed in double-blind and crossover conditions. Serum levels of prazepam and its major metabolite N-desmethyl-diazepam were measured by HPLC. No prazepam was detected at a concentration higher than 20 ng/ml (limit of detection) whereas N-desmethyl-diazepam reached concentrations around 140 ng/ml. To correlate this observation with the clinical data, the affinity of prazepam and N-desmethyl-diazepam was compared measuring their ability to displace 50% of 3H-flunitrazepam bound to benzodiazepine receptors contained in synaptosomal preparation obtained from rat brain. N-desmethyl-diazepam was 17-fold more potent than prazepam. This data suggests that prazepam is a pro-drug which is transformed to the active compound N-desmethyl-diazepam and that the difference in clinical observation with both administrations could be correlated to N-desmethyl-diazepam concentration-time curves. Nevertheless, the comparison of the area under the N-desmethyl-diazepam serum concentration-time curves, the maximum concentrations, the times when the maximum concentrations were observed and the times needed to detect a significant level after oral and sublingual administration did not show statistical difference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2693926": "Principal trends in clinical immunological studies applied to the clinical picture and epidemiology of parasitic diseases are outlined.

It was found that caffeine and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate increased significantly the frequency of slow mepps in Botx-poisoned muscles, but had no effect on slow mepps in control muscles. Vinblastine and cytochalasin B significantly increased the slow mepp frequency in Botx-poisoned as well as in normal control muscles. Inhibitors of oxidative metabolism reduced the frequency of slow mepps by 90%, indicating a high energy requirement for this type of release. No agent was found to augment the slow mepp frequency above 1-2 Hz, suggesting that an upper limit exists for this type of packaging and release of acetylcholine.", "PMC522807": "Diazoxide, clonidine and labetalol, administered intravenously in fixed doses, were used to treat 30 episodes of severe hypertension in 27 patients.

By skin testing, patients allergic to either Triatoma protracta or T. rubida gave positive responses only to the respective salivary antigen. RAST-inhibition experiments demonstrated that binding of IgE antibodies to T. protracta antigen was not inhibited by salivary extracts from T. rubida, T. cavernicola, T. rubrofasciata, or Rhodnius prolixus. The same level of species specificity was found for IgE antibodies to T. rubida. By direct RAST, no T. rubida positive serum bound T. protracta antigen, and 29 of 30 T. protracta positive sera failed to bind T. rubida. One serum from a T. protracta-allergic patient contained IgE antibodies to both T. protracta and T. rubida. RAST-inhibition experiments demonstrated that these antibodies did not cross-react and that this person had separate species-specific antibodies to T. protracta and T. rubida antigens. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of salivary extracts demonstrated that the lower molecular weight bands that contain the antigens responsible for human allergic reactions differed in number and size in all species tested.

In those assigned to thrombolytic therapy, angiographic data were also available after acute reperfusion. Analysis on an \"intention to treat\" basis revealed significant preservation of left ventricular function after thrombolytic therapy (ejection fraction 53%) compared with conventional treatment (ejection fraction 47%). In addition, wall motion analysis showed significant improvement of regional function in the infarct zone in both inferior and anterior infarction. In addition, significant changes occurred in regional function of the remote \"noninfarct zone\" in the acute as well as the chronic stage.

The concentrations of liver glycogen and plasma d-glucose were measured in caesarian-delivered newborn rats at time-intervals up to 3h after delivery after treatment of the neonatal rats with glucagon, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, cortisol or cortisol+dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Glycogenolysis was promoted by glucagon or dibutyryl cyclic AMP in the third hour after birth but not at earlier times. Cortisol and dibutyryl cyclic AMP together (but neither agent alone) promoted glycogenolysis in the second hour after birth, but no hormone combination was effective in the first postnatal hour. 2. The specific radioactivity of plasma d-glucose was measured as a function of time for up to 75 min after the intraperitoneal injection of d-[6-(14)C]glucose and d-[6-(3)H]glucose into newborn rats at delivery and after treatment with glucagon or actinomycin D. Glucagon-mediated hyperglycaemia at this time was due to an increased rate of glucose formation and a decreased rate of glucose utilization. Actinomycin D prevented glucose formation and accelerated the rate of postnatal hypoglycaemia. 3. The specific radioactivity of plasma l-lactate and the incorporation of (14)C into plasma d-glucose was measured as a function of time after the intraperitoneal injection of l-[U-(14)C]lactate into glucagon- or actinomycin D-treated rats immediately after delivery.

Procaterol potently relaxed the isolated guinea pig trachea and lung parenchyma in a concentration-dependent fashion. The drug at a similar range of concentrations antagonized the contraction of the isolated guinea pig trachea and lung parenchyma or human bronchus induced by leukotriene (LT) D4. Salbutamol and isoprenaline also showed similar effects to those of procaterol on the above experiments, but the potencies were consistently weaker than that of procaterol. The release of either histamine or LTs from the passively sensitized human lung fragments was markedly and dose-dependently inhibited by both the 5 min and 15 h treatment with procaterol (10(-10)-10(-7) mol/l) before antigen challenge. Isoprenaline and salbutamol in 5 min treatment experiments showed similar potency as and less potency than procaterol, respectively, on the release of these mediators, but the inhibition potencies of these drugs, particularly isoprenaline, were remarkably reduced by 15 h treatment.

CT demonstrated the lesion in all 84 patients and showed excellent anatomic detail in 64 of the 75 patients with primary neoplasms. CT did not differentiate vessel or nerve entrapment from neurovascular structures that were simply applied to the pseudocapsule of the tumor. Blurring of adjacent fat was an infrequent finding, but when it was present, the tumor was malignant. The CT findings were characteristic enough to suggest the histology of the neoplasm in only 13 lesions (nine lipomas, three hemangiomas, one neurofibroma).

This compares favourably with a mortality of about 34 per cent in a similar group of patients treated in the same hospital during 1965 through 1969. The improvement is partly due to increasing experience of the surgical and anaesthesiological teams and especially to a better appreciation of the importance of ventilatory pulmonary insufficiency and acute respiratory distress syndrome which are frequent in these patients. Early respiratory assistance is indicated in all cases with an instability of the chest wall. The imminence of a respiratory distress syndrome may announce itself by the classical symptoms of an increased breathing rate with hypocarbia before hypoxia becomes manifest. In the majority of patients with a thoracic lesion however the syndrome starts with a combination of increasing dyspnoea and normo- or even hypercarbia.

With concomitant stimulation with LPS, IFN-gamma activated these hybridomas dose dependently to exhibit high tumoricidal activity, whereas single stimulation with either INF-gamma or LPS, even with higher concentrations, did not activate the macrophage hybridomas. This contrasted with the activation of glycogen-PEC for eliciting tumoricidal activity with a single stimulation with LPS (greater than 1 ng/ml) or IFN-gamma (greater than 10 IU/ml).

Heart rate and blood pressure changes were similar during pentobarbital anesthesia except for blood pressure changes during dobutamine infusion.", "PMC3916224": "The review deals with the phenomenology in the studies on characteristics of surface antigenic and immunogenic structures of Rickettsia, their cellular membranes, the processes of metabolic cooperation and interaction with the host cells, and the structure of Rickettsia genome. The data on active antigenic and immunogenic proteins distribution in inner and outer membranes and on osmotically active functioning cellular membrane, including the specific substrate carriers, are discussed. The materials, are presented on the specific ADP-ATP transport system, slightly different from the mitochondrial one, in evidence that Rickettsia utilize ATP in two pathways: endogenous and exogenous. The metabolic regulatory processes, controlled by adenine nucleotides are discussed that could be used as a means of fitting to constantly changing conditions of Rickettsia ecological niche. The Rickettsia deficiency in AMP catabolism enzyme could be used for allosteric-regulation of citrate synthase, the key enzyme in the Krebs cycle. The data on the mol mass of Rickettsia DNA (1 x 10(9)) and the characteristics of plasmids are presented. In conclusion new data on molecular cloning of Rickettsia genes in vector plasmids and the restriction analysis of specific DNA sequences are discussed.", "PMC2377318": "Enhancement of GABAergic transmission in the substantia nigra has been shown to attenuate motor manifestations of diverse seizure models, including kindling. Similar anticonvulsant effects were reported after bilateral lesions of the substantia nigra, supporting the view that the nigra efferents constitute a critical gating mechanism in the propagation of seizure activity. However, in the lesion studies reported so far the nigra was not destroyed selectively so that regions destroyed in addition to the nigra could have been involved in the anticonvulsant effects observed. We destroyed the nigra selectively in fully kindled rats by bilateral microinjection of small amounts of the neurotoxin ibotenic acid. Two groups of rats were studied; one was kindled from stimulation of the basolateral amygdala, the other from stimulation of the piriform cortex. In both groups, there was no indication of a reduction in seizure susceptibility, seizure severity or seizure duration after bilateral destruction of the nigra. The data thus indicate that, at least in kindled rats, the substantia nigra might be less important for seizure generation and/or propagation than previously thought.", "PMC3101990": "Beta electrocorticographic rhythms (30-45 Hz) develop during focused immobile attention within two distinct foci in cats. A multiple electrode exploration was performed, followed by post-mortem histological analysis, to determine the precise localization of these foci. Electrode tips recording beta rhythms in the waking attentive cat were located: in motor areas (Brodmann's areas 4 and 6), in a band extending from the postcruciate cortex to the walls of the presylvian sulcus, crossing the frontal pole (anterior beta focus); in the posterior parietal associative area 5a, along the divisions of the ansate sulcus (posterior beta focus). The two foci are separated by somatic areas 3, 2 and 1, where beta rhythms were never recorded. The location of the posterior focus may suggest that area 5 is, in the cat as it is in the monkey, involved in motor control.", "PMC3390597": "The present study was designed to examine both acute and chronic effects of cryothermia on the coronary arteries in the experimental model. Microscopic examination has revealed coronary intimal hyperplasia in the majority of coronary arteries at the site of cryogenic lesion.

In the acquisition phase, a group (N = 6) given H before testing (HB) showed severely retarded acquisition and performance of the escape response, as compared with a group (N = 6) given H after testing (HA). When the HB and HA treatments were reversed for the groups behavioral performance was initially unaffected. At first, the HA group switched to the HB condition continued to exhibit rapid escape behavior and the HB group switched to the HA treatment continued to have slow escape behavior. Over the course of 8 days of testing, however, the performances of the two groups gradually reversed. After completion of this testing the HB and HA treatments again were switched and the animals were tested for both avoidance and escape behavior. Again, the performance of the animals initially did not change after the treatment switch, but with repeated testing and treatments, the avoidance and escape behavior of the HB group slowed substantially and that of the HA group accelerated markedly. These findings support previous observations that over learned behaviors are much less sensitive to disruption by haloperidol treatment than behaviors which are undergoing learning. The important contribution of the present study was in demonstrating that this insensitivity is a transitional, transient phenomenon and that with chronic treatment and testing, over learned behaviors can be strongly affected by haloperidol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2106494": "Rabbit antisera evoked by type 5 streptococcal M protein (M5) were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunological cross-reactivity with purified rabbit muscle phosphorylases a and b. Of 10 pep M5 antisera tested, 3 showed significant cross-reactivity with both forms of the enzyme. ELISA inhibition studies using one of the pep M5 antisera showed that all of the phosphorylase b antibodies were inhibited by pep M5, the immunogen, and phosphorylase b, the ELISA antigen. All of the antibodies were also inhibited by pep M6 and pep M19, but not by pep M24, indicating that the cross-reactive epitopes were shared by multiple serotypes of M protein. Western blot (immunoblot) analyses showed that pep M5 antisera reacted strongly with the subunit of phosphorylase b. In addition, purified phosphorylase partially inhibited the binding of pep M5 antibodies to a 95-kilodalton protein of human myocardium. One of the three cross-reactive pep M5 antisera inhibited the enzymatic activity of phosphorylase a in a dose-related fashion, reaching a maximum inhibition of 75%.

The revised classification provides additional steps in the grading scale for some characteristics, separates other characteristics previously combined, expands the section on macular edema, and adds several characteristics not previously graded. The classification is described and illustrated and its reproducibility between graders is assessed by calculating percentages of agreement and kappa statistics for duplicate gradings of baseline color nonsimultaneous stereoscopic fundus photographs. For retinal hemorrhages and/or microaneurysms, hard exudates, new vessels, fibrous proliferations, and macular edema, agreement was substantial (weighted kappa, 0.61 to 0.80). For soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, and venous beading, agreement was moderate (weighted kappa, 0.41 to 0.60). A double grading system, with adjudication of disagreements of two or more steps between duplicate gradings, led to some improvement in reproducibility for most characteristics.", "PMC4333397": "A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.", "PMC3503459": "Benign neoplasms of the stomach lead to atypical symptoms.

This was mainly due to the localisation or the extent of the lesions. One surgical complication occurred and one patient died. Relapse was never observed in the long-term (i.e. 6 years) follow-up of 29 patients.

The hyperthermia was non-invasively induced using an annular phased array radiative electromagnetic system. Treatment was well tolerated, and none of the patients experienced severe rectal or bladder complications. Three patients are free from disease; one patient experience local-regional recurrence based on biopsy; one recurred in the bladder, was treated with cystoprostatectomy and subsequently succumbed to metastatic disease; and one patient died of presumed metastatic disease.

Cells stimulated immediately after isolation from murine spleen (\"fresh\" T cells) and cells restimulated after 4 days of in vitro culture (\"primed\" T cells) were compared. Northern blot analysis and bioassays were used to analyze and quantitate production of eight lymphokines and the IL-2R. Fresh T cells produced high levels of IL-2 and low to moderate levels of IL-3, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, and IFN-gamma. In vitro primed T cells produced IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, IFN-gamma, and high levels of IL-2R RNA. Comparison of RNA levels and bioassays of supernatants from these populations indicated that primed T cells produced at least 10-fold more of six of the lymphokines than fresh T cells. Only IL-2 was produced in near equal amounts by fresh and primed T cells. There were also marked differences in the kinetics of lymphokine production by fresh and primed CD4+ T cells. After restimulation with Con A and PMA, primed cells produced a short burst of lymphokine RNA that peaked between 7.5 and 13 h and declined after 18 h. Fresh T cells lagged in the initial production of lymphokine RNA, with levels peaking 18 to 44 h after mitogenic stimulation. Depletion of CD4+ cells indicated that cells of helper phenotype were responsible for the majority of lymphokine production from the primed cells. Thus different subpopulations of Th cells defined by their respective ability to respond either directly (fresh T cells) or only after culture and restimulation (primed T cells) show different patterns of lymphokine gene regulation. Other studies suggest that the activity of \"fresh\" Th cells is due to a population with a \"memory\" phenotype, while the cells which require culture have a \"precursor\" phenotype. These distinct patterns of lymphokine gene regulation in the two populations of Th cells may account in part for differences seen in the kinetics and magnitude of the naive and memory immune responses which are regulated by Th cells.", "PMC3412798": "This paper presents the highlights of a month invested as a volunteer at St. Jude Hospital in St. Lucia, West Indies, representing Orthopaedics Overseas.", "PMC2679680": "In an open, randomized clinical study, the safety and efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin was compared to that of cefotetan in 95 hospital patients with gynecologic or obstetric infections.

In addition to identifying aberrant brain function in the traditional language-associated left posterior region, we also observed medial frontal lobe differences from normals, a finding confirmed by others in recent research. Our subsequent study sought to refine further current definitional subgroupings within the broad entity known as dyslexia-pure. Indeed language-based subgroups appear to have identifiable and differing topographic signatures. Furthermore, based on correlations between neuropsychological test scores and neurophysiological measurements, we suggest that subgroup electrophysiological differences may reflect compensatory as well as pathological brain activity. We believe that the currently expanding understanding of the neurophysiology of dyslexia will lead eventually to improved diagnosis and remediation of this learning disability. The detailed mapping of brain electrical activity shows promise of providing the neuropsychologist and learning disability specialist with another \"perspective\" on reading disability.

These experiments showed that viral polypeptides formed three sequentially synthesized, coordinately regulated groups designated alpha, beta, and gamma. Specifically: (i) The alpha group, containing one minor structural and several nonstructural polypeptides, was synthesized at highest rates from 3 to 4 h postinfection in untreated cells and at diminishing rates thereafter. The beta group, also containing minor structural and nonstructural polypeptides, was synthesized at highest rates from 5 to 7 h and at decreasing rates thereafter. The gamma group containing major structural polypeptides was synthesized at increasing rates until at least 12 h postinfection. (ii) The synthesis of alpha polypeptides did not require prior infected cell protein synthesis. In contrast, the synthesis of beta polypeptides required both prior alpha polypeptide synthesis as well as new RNA synthesis, since the addition of actinomycin D immediately after removal of cycloheximide precluded beta polypeptide synthesis. The function supplied by the alpha polypeptides was stable since interruption of protein synthesis after alpha polypeptide synthesis began and before beta polypeptides were made did not prevent the immediate synthesis of beta polypeptides once the drug was withdrawn. The requirement of gamma polypeptide synthesis for prior synthesis of beta polypeptides seemed to be similar to that of beta polypeptides for prior synthesis of the alpha group. (iii) The rates of synthesis of alpha polypeptides were highest immediately after removal of cycloheximide and declined thereafter concomitant with the initiation of beta polypeptide synthesis; this decline in alpha polypeptide synthesis was less rapid in the presence of actinomycin D which prevented the appearance of beta and gamma polypeptides. The decrease in rates of synthesis of beta polypeptides normally occurring after 7 h postinfection was also less rapid in the presence of actinomycin D than in its absence, whereas ongoing synthesis of gamma polypeptides at this time was rapidly reduced by actinomycin D. (iv) Inhibitors of DNA synthesis (cytosine arabinoside or hydroxyurea) did not prevent the synthesis of alpha, beta, or gamma polypeptides, but did reduce the amounts of gamma polypeptides made.", "PMC2109977": "Examination of paired umbilical arterial and umbilical venous blood gases for 147 term, healthy newborns revealed a strong correlation of pH, bicarbonate, and base excess with the 1-minute Apgar score.

While untreated Wistar-Furth (WFu, RT1u) rats reject Buffalo (BUF, RT1b) heart allografts within a mean survival time of 6.6 +/- 0.5 days, recipients treated with 3 cycles of CsA alone (-1,0,1; 7,8,9; 15,16,17) maintained BUF heart allografts up to an MST of 22.5 +/- 8.9 days. When CsA was combined with BUF HAg (-1), BUF heart survival was further prolonged up to an MST of 34.2 +/- 6.6 days, while third-party BN HAg was ineffective (MST of 21.5 +/- 2.1 days). On day 10 postgrafting, the frequency of T cytotoxic cells (fTc) within the splenic pan-T-cell population was 1:1437 +/- 301 in CsA and 1:1087 +/- 438 in CsA/HAg treated recipients. In contrast, on day 30 postgrafting, both CsA and CsA/HAg treated WFu rats bearing functional BUF hearts showed within their splenic pan-T-cell populations a profound decrease in fTc to 1:2966 +/- 824 with CsA alone and to 1:4946 +/- 938 with CsA/HAg treatment. In contrast, both untreated WFu rats who rejected BUF heart allografts and CsA-treated WFu recipients who had rejected their BUF heart allografts on day 20 displayed an increased fTc to 696 +/- 243 and to 1:1169, respectively, when examined at day 30 postgrafting. Additionally, both the W3/25+ and OX8+ T cell subsets specifically suppressed the proliferative response of normal WFu T cells against BUF and, to a lesser degree, third-party BN irradiated stimulators. Thus, CsA-treated animals develop a potent specific-suppressor mechanism that is augmented by pretreatment with donor soluble antigen.

This expectation was realized: 1 and 2 were cytotoxic in isolated rat hepatocytes. The cytotoxicity of 1 was greater in hepatocytes from phenobarbital-treated rats compared with control rats and in male than in female rats and was inhibited by carbon monoxide and 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl 2,2-diphenylvalerate HCl (SKF 525-A). Benzyl sulfides 1 and 2 were metabolized to benzaldehyde by rat hepatic microsomal fractions and by a purified, reconstituted cytochrome P-450PB-B system. Benzaldehyde was not cytotoxic. These results provide support for the hypothesis that benzyl sulfides 1 and 2 and the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates yield unstable thiols, which may give rise to acylating agents or to stable, but toxic, terminal products that are responsible for the cytotoxic effects of the benzyl sulfides and cysteine S-conjugates.", "PMC3985706": "The prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus in dogs in the Turkana District of Kenya was 39.4% of 695 examined.

The possible sources of these infections are discussed. The prevalence rate differed in various parts of the district, ranging from 63.5% in the northwest, where the highest incidence of human hydatidosis also occurs, to nil along the shores of Lake Turkana. Infection rates of 32.0% and 16.7% were recorded at Lokitaung (north-east) and Lodwar (central), while in the south 48.9% of dogs harboured Echinococcus. This latter figure is surprising as the area has a low incidence of human hydatidosis. The Turkana keep a large number of dogs, and the reasons for this and the social role of the dog in the district is discussed. No difference in susceptibility was found between Turkana-type dogs and those of mixed breeds from Nairobi when they were experimentally infected with hydatid protoscolices from man, camels, cattle, sheep and goats. However, it proved difficult to infect the Turkana-type of dogs with viable protoscolices of cattle origin. The reasons for this and its epidemiological implications remain unclear.

In the first experiment, smokers rated puffs of their own brands of cigarette, a commercial low tar and nicotine cigarette, and refined smoke. The refined smoke was rated significantly stronger and more desirable than the low tar and nicotine cigarette despite a comparably low nicotine delivery; subjects' own brands were rated best, but in standardized smoking tests delivered over ten times more tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide. In the second experiment, subjects smoked five times on each of two mornings; one day they received refined smoke and the other day smoked a low tar and nicotine cigarette. The refined smoke produced significantly more satisfaction, yet delivered far less carbon monoxide and tar (assessed by mouth intake). Nicotine intake was comparable to that of the low tar and nicotine cigarette. Because refined smoke substantially reduced subjects' craving for cigarettes while reducing nicotine intake, it may prove to be a useful short-term adjunct to a smoking cessation program. Additionally, the method may be useful in research analyzing the relative contributions of pharmacologic actions of inhaled smoke and the sensory cues associated with nicotine intake as reinforcers maintaining smoking behavior.", "PMC1933214": "In the Nottingham Breast Clinic 5000 new cases are seen annually; 3000 are sent because the general practitioner believes that he/she has found a lump.

Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the frequency of AVAs and their structural characteristics by using the vascular corrosive resin casts and further examination under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). This method permitted not only the visualization of a three-dimensional view of AVAs, but also depicted a clear differentiation between AVAs and arterioles or venules. Within the vascular architecture of rabbit ear, three distinctive vascular layers could be identified. The frontal and dorsal epithelial vascular layers are distributed underneath the epithelium and formed with nearly all capillaries, and the intermediate vascular layer which is established with main arteries, veins and their branches. The AVAs were observed in all three vascular layers, although various venous valves were concentrated primarily in the intermediate vascular layer. In tabulating the frequency of appearance of AVAs, the mean number was 81.5 per centimeter square. The mean number of AVAs in each of the three vascular layers was 31.1 in the frontal layer, 17.1 in the intermediate layer and 33.1 in dorsal layer, respectively. The vasculature of rabbit ear was further anatomically divided into tip, middle and root portions. The mean number of AVAs in each portion, from the tip to the root was 112.9, 49.4 and 84.4, respectively. Several essential types of AVAs were observed, such as the S-shaped and similar forms which were the predominate type. Others observed were U-shaped, straight, Y-shaped and tri-branching types. Most AVAs within the intermediate vascular layer, consisting of a few small vessels which were mainly capillaries and venules, connected to the anastomosing portion of AVA. The high occurrence and strategic location of AVAs in the rabbit ear strongly suggest that AVAs in the rabbit ear partake in thermal regulation.", "PMC2225802": "Twenty-seven patients meeting DSM-III diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) completed the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire (PDQ; a self-rating scale designed to assess the axis II personality disorders [PDs] from the DSM-III) before and after 12 weeks of treatment with clomipramine. Treatment was accompanied with reduction on several personality variables, including the number of personality diagnoses assigned, the distribution of traits in the sample, and the number of items endorsed in each personality category. The data also showed that improvement in personality functioning was significantly greater in responders compared with nonresponders or partial responders.

The appearance of these characteristics in other disorders suggests some relation between them and, consequently, the treatment of these disorders may be enhanced by conceptualizing them as OCD \"variants\".", "PMC4214783": "Presistent infections with rubella virus were established in baby hamster kidney, BSC-1, HeLa, RK-13, rabbit embryo chondrocyte, and Vero cell lines. All of the cultures except Vero continually produced rubella virus and interferon to which the virus was sensitive. Concurrently, only the Vero cells did not display interference against superinfection with Newcastle disease and vesicular stomatitis viruses. The addition of 1,000 U of exogenous interferon to the cultures cured only the rabbit embryo and Vero cells of the persistent infection. That the interferon is not required for the initiation and maintenance of rubella viral persistence in vitro is implied by the following. (1) Vero cells were persistently infected in the absence of interferon; (2) actinomycin D or cortisone inhibited interferon synthesis but not the rubella viral infection; and (3) cells continuously cultured in the presence of cortisone maintained a viral persistence without interferon synthesis. On the other hand, interferon seems to be responsible for the viral interference; Vero cells infected with rubella virus and cultures inoculated with rubella virus in the presence of actinomycin D or cortisone did not display interference against Newcastle disease or vesicular stomatitis viruses.", "PMC4214781": "Purification of progenitor toxin of Clostridium botulinum type B strain Okra was undertaken by sequential steps of acid precipitation, extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, ribonuclease digestion, acid precipitation, protamine treatment, sulphopropyl-Sephadex chromatography, and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Two different molecular-sized toxins, named large (L) and medium (M) toxins, were obtained. L toxin was centrifugally homogeneous but electrophoretically heterogeneous. It contained 2.5 x 10(8) to 3.0 x 10(8) mean lethal doses per mg of nitrogen, and its sedimentation constant was 16S. M toxin was centrifugally and electrophoretically homogeneous. It contained 5.5 x 10(8) to 6.0 x 10(8) mean lethal doses per mg of nitrogen, and its sedimentation constant was 12S. The presence of both L and M toxins in spent culture was demonstrated. It seems justified, therefore, to call both progenitor toxins. Both consisted of toxic and nontoxic components. The toxic components of L and M toxins appeared to be identical with each other. The nontoxic component of L toxin was 12S and possessed a hemagglutinin activity of about 0.5% that of type A crystalline toxin; that of M toxin was 7S and possessed no hemagglutinin activity. They were antigenically related but not identical.", "PMC3427047": "Two new reactive adenine nucleotide analogues have been synthesized and characterized: 2-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate (2-BDB-TA-2',5'-DP) and 2-[(3-bromo-2-oxopropyl)thio]adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate (2-BOP-TA-2',5'-DP). Starting with NADP+, 2'-phospho-adenosine 5'-(diphosphoribose) (PADPR) was generated enzymatically and was converted to PADPR 1-oxide by reaction with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Treatment with NaOH followed by reaction with carbon disulfide yielded 2-thioadenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate (TA-2',5'-DP). Condensation of TA-2',5'-DP with 1,4-dibromobutanedione or 1,3-dibromo-2-propanone gave the final products 2-BDB-TA-2',5'-DP and 2-BOP-TA-2',5'-DP, respectively. The structure of these new reagents was determined by UV, 1H NMR, 31P NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as by bromide and phosphorus analysis. Both of these reagents exhibit properties expected for an affinity label of the coenzyme site of NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. With both reagents, biphasic kinetics of inactivation are observed that can be described in terms of a fast initial phase of inactivation resulting in partially active enzyme of 6-7% residual activity, followed by a slower phase leading to total inactivation. The inactivation rate constants for both reagents exhibit a nonlinear dependence on reagent concentration, consistent with the formation of a reversible complex with the enzyme prior to irreversible modification. The enzyme incorporates both reagents to a limited extent and is protected against inactivation by NADP+ and NADPH. The reaction of these new nucleotide analogues with isocitrate dehydrogenase is compared to the much slower inactivation caused by bromoacetone, indicating the importance of the nucleotide moiety in the functioning of the affinity labels. It is likely that 2-BDB-TA-2',5'-DP and 2-BOP-TA-2',5'-DP will have general applicability as affinity labels for other NADP+ binding enzymes.", "PMC2364707": "Infarction of the pons and rostral medulla secondary to arteriolar thrombosis was documented histologically in a 17-year-old mixed-Arabian female horse.

The majority of these patients were male, 76% were between 21 and 50 years of age, 33% were indigent, and 38% were either black or of mixed race. Rigid exclusion criteria were established in the selection of kidney donors. All donor operations were at least 2-antigen-compatible. Surgical technique and posttransplant management were standard, except that in 1980 the immunosuppressive policy was changed as follows: posttransplant prednisone was very rapidly tapered to 20 mg/day at two weeks after transplantation and antilymphocyte globulin was used to treat all rejections. The overall 3-year patient survival for the 7 1/2 years is 91.6%, but after 1980 it increased to 98% perhaps a reflection of the changes in immunosuppressive policy. Eight of ten deaths were due to sepsis, most of them related to rejection treatment. The 3-year kidney survival was 77%. All kidney losses were due to rejection. A low incidence of urological complications is reported. There were no technical losses. A relatively low incidence of cancer is reported. Cutaneous mycosis is highly prevalent in our patients, but systemic fungi are virtually absent.", "PMC3887386": "Pre-transplant blood transfusions (BT) improve the survival of kidney grafts. Apart from specific immunoregulation by T suppressor cells or anti-idiotypic antibodies, the role of non-specific immunoregulatory factors, such as prostaglandins is being discussed as a possible mechanism for this effect. We studied the in vitro prostanoid release from peripheral mononuclear cells following three deliberate blood transfusions. Twenty-five previously non-transfused dialysis patients were studied. Spontaneous and LPS-induced prostaglandin E (PGE) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) were determined in cell-free culture supernatants by fluid phase RIA. Transfused patients exhibited a more rapid onset and steeper increase of prostanoid production. After 24 hours incubation, the spontaneous and LPS-induced PGE release of pre- and post-BT cells was significantly different (pre-BT: 2.1 and 5.1 ng/ml; post-3-BT: 5.0 and 7.9 ng/ml; p less than 0.01). Pre-BT cells released considerably lower amounts of TXB2 than post-BT cells (spontaneous release: 39 vs 88 ng/ml; LPS-induced release: 62 ng/ml vs 129 ng/ml; p less than 0.05). After correction for monocytes as defined by monoclonal antibodies, post-BT cells again showed increased prostanoid release as compared to pre-BT cells. Therefore, the enhanced PGE and TXB2 release of post-BT cells is not caused by an increase merely in the number of monocytes. Rather, BT appear to induce an enhanced release of prostanoids by activation of monocytes. We also found a correlation between the number of BT and the amount of prostanoid release.", "PMC3095310": "Aflatoxin M1 can be confirmed directly on a thin layer plate by reacting the toxin with a mixture of reagents containing p-anisaldehyde. This confirmatory procedure requires only 2 elutions in the same direction using 2 different solvents. The mixture containing p-anisaldehyde is overspotted on M1 after the plate has been developed in toluene-ethyl acetate-ethyl ether-formic acid (25 + 35 + 40 + 5). The plate is heated at 110 degrees C for 10 min and then developed in hexane-acetone-chloroform (15 + 50 + 35). The Rf value of the green fluorescent derivative is less than that of the M1 standard. This confirmatory procedure requires only one-dimensional TLC, so several sample extracts and the standard can be run simultaneously. The minimum detectable quantity of aflatoxin M1 on the TLC plate with this test is 0.3 ng. p-Anisaldehyde reagent solution may also be used as a spray reagent for the confirmation of aflatoxin M1. The procedures described were satisfactory for confirming the mycotoxin in spiked samples of powdered and liquid milk.", "PMC3567009": "The disposition of free and of total tryptophan following an intravenous load of 1.5 g of L-tryptophan was evaluated in eight patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease, 40 patients with cirrhosis of the liver (21 Child's A, 15 Child's B, 4 Child's C) and in 14 healthy subjects. Cirrhosis affected disposition of tryptophan by (a) decreasing the clearance of both free and total tryptophan by 64% (P less than 0.001) and 34% (P less than 0.01), respectively, (b) by increasing the apparent volume of distribution of total tryptophan by 42% (P less than 0.01) by expansion of the peripheral compartment, resulting in (c) a threefold increase in the half-life of tryptophan. Apart from a reduction in free tryptophan clearance, these changes in tryptophan disposition were not apparent in patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease. Elevated fasting free tryptophan plasma concentrations are an indicator of impaired tryptophan metabolism in cirrhosis. They result from a decreased hepatic clearance of tryptophan rather than from a reduction in tryptophan protein binding. This study emphasises the markedly differing pharmacokinetic behaviour of tryptophan in cirrhotic patients compared with normal subjects and with patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease.", "PMC1697748": "The liver contains two types of galactose receptors, specific for Kupffer and parenchymal cells respectively. These receptors are only expressed in the liver, and therefore are attractive targets for the specific delivery of drugs. We provided low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a particle with a diameter of 23 nm in which a variety of drugs can be incorporated, with terminal galactose residues by lactosylation. Radioiodinated LDL, lactosylated to various extents (60-400 mol of lactose/ mol of LDL), was injected into rats. The plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of radioactivity were correlated with the extent of lactosylation. Highly lactosylated LDL (greater than 300 lactose/LDL) is completely cleared from the blood by liver within 10 min. Pre-injection with N-acetylgalactosamine blocks liver uptake, which indicates that the hepatic recognition sites are galactose-specific. The hepatic uptake occurs mainly by parenchymal and Kupffer cells. At a low degree of lactosylation, approx. 60 lactose/LDL, the specific uptake (ng/mg of cell protein) is 28 times higher in Kupffer cells than in parenchymal cells. However, because of their much larger mass, parenchymal cells are the main site of uptake. At high degrees of lactosylation (greater than 300 lactose/LDL), the specific uptake in Kupffer cells is 70-95 times that in parenchymal cells. Under these conditions, Kupffer cells are, despite their much smaller mass, the main site of uptake. Thus not only the size but also the surface density of galactose on lactosylated LDL is important for the balance of uptake between Kupffer and parenchymal cells. This knowledge should allow us to design particulate galactose-bearing carriers for the rapid transport of various drugs to either parenchymal cells or Kupffer cells.", "PMC3813379": "Some diseases of the larynx that now are rare were common in 1950, when the author began the practice of pediatric otolaryngology.

ALS case with severe bulbar disorder showed atrophic, irregularly margin tongue with increased signal intensity in T1-weighted MRI. ALS with less severe bulbar disorder demonstrated mixed hyperintensity and normointensity areas in the tongue. ALS without lingual symptoms showed increased intensity of tongue which suggested subclinical involvement of lingual muscle. BSMA case also showed atrophic tongue with diffusely increased signal intensity. SDS case with sleep apnea was revealed to have round shaped tongue without increased signal intensity, but his tongue fell into the posterior oral cavity, indicating hypotonus of genioglossus muscle. We concluded that MRI of the tongue is useful to determine the bulbar symptoms due to lower neuron disorder or not.", "PMC4215534": "Measurements of total body potassium (T.B.K.) were made by whole-body counting in four groups of patients receiving oral frusemide for one year. Patients in group 1 had essential hypertension and normal renal function and received 40 mg frusemide daily without potassium supplements. Patients in group 2 were similar but received oral potassium supplements for the first four months of treatment. Patients in group 3 had hypertension associated with renal disease and received 120 mg frusemide daily without potassium supplements. Patients in group 4 also had hypertension and renal impairment and in addition to 120 mg frusemide daily they received oral potassium supplements for four months. No evidence of depletion of T.B.K. was found in any of the groups after continuous treatment with frusemide for one year. It is questioned whether potassium supplementation in long term diuretic therapy with frusemide is necessary unless there is evidence of pre-existing potassium depletion or of some other factor such as cardiac failure, cirrhosis of the liver, or the nephrotic syndrome.", "PMC2891702": "The GH4C1 pituitary cell line contains specific plasma membrane receptors for the inhibitory neuropeptide somatostatin (SRIF). Unlike other peptides which bind to cell surface receptors on these cells, SRIF is not rapidly internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here we examined the effects of chronic SRIF pretreatment on the subsequent ability of GH4C1 cells to bind and respond to this hormone. Treatment of cells with 100 nM SRIF increased [125I-Tyr1]SRIF binding to a maximum value of 220% of control after 20 h. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the number, but not the affinity, of the receptors was altered. The effect of SRIF was dose-dependent (ED50 = 2.3 +/- 0.4 nM), was not mimicked by an inactive analog, and was specific for the SRIF receptor. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with other agents, which mimic SRIF's action to decrease intracellular cAMP and free Ca2+ concentrations, did not mimic the SRIF-induced increase in receptor number. Thus, occupancy of the SRIF receptor was required for SRIF receptor up-regulation. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not prevent the SRIF-induced increase in receptors, consistent with an effect of SRIF to either reduce receptor degradation or cause slow redistribution of preexisting receptors to the plasma membrane. In contrast to the effects on receptor binding, pretreating cells with SRIF did not alter either basal cAMP levels or the potency of SRIF to inhibit cAMP accumulation (ED50 = 0.5 +/- 0.2 nM). However, the maximum cAMP produced by stimulators of adenylyl cyclase was increased. The observation that chronic SRIF exposure did not cause homologous desensitization in GH4C1 cells and increased rather than decreased SRIF receptor number is consistent with the fact that this neuropeptide is not rapidly internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis.", "PMC3770887": "A case of gastric rupture is described in a patient who was wearing a lap and diagonal inertia reel seat belt at the time of a head-on collision.

The time and motion study examined waiting times associated with all phases of emergency care delivery and various levels of patient acuity. The time it took for other departments to provide services and procedures was seen as a significant contributing factor to ED waiting time. Data from this study have already been used to help the medical center identify and correct ED inefficiencies.", "PMC2808146": "Electroneural response patterns of single auditory-nerve neurons were studied in aminoglycoside-deafened squirrel monkeys. The electrical stimuli were delivered through bipolar electrodes implanted in the scala tympani. The effects of pulse width, shape, frequency, and intensity on neural adaptation, phase locking, and spectral content were evaluated. Our results did not demonstrate the characteristic adaptation seen in auditory-nerve neurons in response to acoustic stimulation. Phase locking to a broad stimulus pulse (3200 microseconds/phase) was found to a very restricted phase angle of the electrical stimulus which was broader for square wave than for sine wave stimulation. The latency of the phase locked response varied inversely with stimulus intensity with greater variation for square wave stimulation than for sine wave stimulation. Auditory neurons were capable of a very high degree of phase locking to a 200-microseconds/phase pulse presented at 156 pulses per second (PPS) and to the first pulse of a 2500-Hz pulse burst. Phase locking was much poorer for the subsequent 200-microseconds/phase pulses comprising the 2500-Hz pulse burst where the neuron's response was determined by its relative recovery status. These findings can be explained by an interaction between the neuron's relative refractory status and its integration of charge over the stimulatory half cycle of the electrical stimulus. These two factors also appear to determine the interspike interval of the neural response. This interval decreased monotonically with increasing stimulus intensity. The neural spike rate (150-500 Hz) producing this interval increased with intensity and may be a source of periodicity information which the central auditory nervous system could interpret as pitch. This may account for the proportional relationship between pitch and stimulus intensity seen in some cochlear implant patients. Our study demonstrates that auditory-nerve neurons comply with basic neurophysiological principles in their responses to electrical stimulation. These principles should be incorporated into the cochlear prosthesis stimulator if more normal neural response patterns are desired in the cochlear prosthesis patient.", "PMC3182197": "Albino rats were maintained in 60% oxygen from birth through 14 days of age. Control rats were simultaneously maintained in room air. At the end of the exposure period some animals from both groups were prepared for electroretinography and, following this analysis, were sacrificed for histological scrutiny of retinal vasculature. The rest of the rats were removed to room air and allowed to remain for various periods of time before electroretinography and sacrifice. Some of the retinas from the latter group were analyzed for the presence of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by immunocytochemistry. Oxygen exposed rats had a permanent reduction of the b-wave of the electroretinogram (ERG). The a-waves of the two groups were indistinguishable. Control rats showed GFAP reactivity in the retinal astrocytes at all times. The oxygen-treated rats showed positive GFAP-staining in astrocytes at all times and in Muller cells from 2 weeks post-treatment through 8 weeks post-treatment, the last time point. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the anti-GFAP reacted with a protein having a molecular weight and solubility characteristics like those of GFAP. These results indicate that Muller cells produce GFAP in response to oxygen-rearing in newborn rats and that this production occurs in the absence of any detectable neuronal cell death.", "PMC2886342": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed, and in 1979 almost 10% of the adult population was taking them. Prior studies of outpatient usage of benzodiazepines have relied on survey or prescription data, which may be confounded by noncompliance. To determine the actual use of benzodiazepines, plasma benzodiazepine concentrations were measured in 225 consecutive outpatients from a university cardiology outpatient service. Self reports indicated that the great majority of the patients (191) were taking at least one medicine, and 70 reported being on a psychotropic drug. Seventy-seven patients reported taking benzodiazepines, the majority being on bromazepam (20), diazepam (26) or oxazepam (19). In 25 of those 77 patients, the reported drug could not be detected in plasma. Conversely, in 10 of the 225 patients, benzodiazepines which were not reported were detected (diazepam or flurazepam). Of those taking benzodiazepines, many had a low concentration, suggesting intermittent rather than regular use. Thus, many patients for whom benzodiazepines are prescribed take them irregularly, and a small group uses them without reporting their prescription. These findings have implications for the clinical presentation of illness and for the possibility of drug interactions.", "PMC3866251": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors from the avian central nervous system were examined for developmental changes that correlated with the differentiation of cholinergic synapses. In contrast to previous studies that showed a single molecular weight form of muscarinic receptors in the mature central nervous system, the current study of receptors from embryonic and newly hatched chick retina showed the presence of two electrophoretic forms having apparent molecular weights of 86,200 +/- 400 and 72,200 +/- 300. Two receptor forms also were observed in embryonic cerebrum, optic tectum, and cerebellum. Each form was present, although decreased in molecular weight by 6000, after treatment with deglycosylating enzymes, consistent with molecular differences occurring in the protein portions, rather than the carbohydrate portions, of the molecules. The relative proportions of the high and low molecular weight receptors in retina showed a striking inversion during development. Before synaptogenesis, receptors were mainly of Mr 86,000, whereas after synaptogenesis, receptors were mainly of Mr 72,000. Development of a predominantly low molecular weight receptor population also occurred in aggregate, but not monolayer, cell culture, suggesting a possible role for cell-cell interactions in triggering the change. Pulse-chase labeling of receptors on cultured cells indicated that both forms were present on the cell surface; the labeled Mr 86,000 population had a half-life of 5 hr, whereas the labeled Mr 72,000 population had a half-life of 19 hr. The change in size of muscarinic receptors during development may reflect the action of regulatory mechanisms critical to the proper assembly and function of synapses in the central nervous system.", "PMC5139988": "Victims of severe injuries frequently pass haemoglobin, myoglobin, or both proteins in their urine. If the kidneys of such persons are to be considered as donor material for transplantation, a pathology department may be requested to identify which of these pigments is present. If freshly passed urine is available, haemoglobinuria in the absence of myoglobinuria may be rapidly identified by spectroscopy. However, the rapid degradation of myoglobin to the met-myoglobin form will make spectroscopic recognition of this pigment in the urine unreliable. In the absence of variant haemoglobins, myoglobin may be easily distinguished from normal haemoglobin by routine electrophoresis on paper, starch gel, or cellulose acetate at alkaline pH. The electrophoretic method of choice in the presence of variant haemoglobins utilizes polyacrylamide gel at 12 g/100 ml as a supporting medium. At this concentration, the migration both of haemoglobin and its variants is sufficiently retarded to allow the easy recognition of myoglobin.", "PMC3034893": "Flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase (ATP:FMN adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.2) was purified about 10,000-fold from the high-speed supernatant of rat liver by a sequence of ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatographies on DEAE-Sephadex (A-50), chromatofocusing, FMN-agarose affinity, and Sephadex G-200. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 133 units (nanomoles of FAD formed per min at 37 degrees C)/mg of protein. This preparation was free from contaminating FAD pyrophosphatase. The apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 97,000 by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an apparent subunit molecular weight of 53,000. Hence, the enzyme is a dimer of approximately 100,000. The enzyme was found most active at pH 7.1, requires Mg2+, and is essentially irreversible in the direction of FAD formation. Kinetic analysis gave Km values of 9.6 microM for FMN and 53 microM for ATP.", "PMC3068283": "Vitreous examination is an important component of diagnosing and managing vitreoretinal disease, but the relative transparency of vitreous makes its examination difficult. Study of the vitreous is facilitated by the use of a biomicroscope to create an optical section and appropriate lenses to neutralize or modify the dioptric power of the eye. This article describes the vitreous examination using the preset El Bayadi-Kajiura lens, stretching the advantages and accuracy of this method. This lens is a +58,6 diopter preset lens producing an inverted real image between the slit lamp and the preset lens. This precorneal positive-diopter lens increase the refractive power of the eye, thus permitting biomicroscopic viewing of an ariel image, similar to the principle of indirect ophthalmoscopy. The major advantage compared to the Goldmann lens is the better visualisation of complex posterior vitreoretinal relationships, allowed by larger image, large illumination-observation angle and lower level of distortion and glare. The Goldmann lens permits a comprehensive intraocular examination, whereas with the EBK lens, observation and documentation of vitroretinal structures are limited to within 50 degrees of the fovea. Thus, the Goldmann lens is essential to evaluate more peripheral vitreous pathology. The Goldmann lens is more accurate in evaluating the presence of cells in the vitreous, which could be due to greater magnification. In a comprehensive examination of the vitreous, the Goldmann and EBK lenses are complementary. The latter is optimal for viewing complex posterior vitreous pathology; the former is necessary for viewing the peripheral vitreous. Photographic documentation of vitreoretinal relationship is better with the EBK than with the Goldmann lens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2171714": "We used standard techniques of receptor autoradiography to study the distribution of inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter receptors in human normal cerebellar cortex. Benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor density was relatively high in both granule cell and molecular layers. GABAA receptor density was highest in granule cell layer with lower receptor density in molecular layer. There was a lower density of GABAB receptors than GABAA receptors in both molecular and granule cell layers with a relatively higher density of GABAB receptors in molecular layer than in granule cell layer. In granule cell layer, the density of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of excitatory amino acid receptors was greatest whereas in molecular layer the quisqualate (QA) receptor subtype density was greatest. With [3H]N-(1-[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl)3-4-piperidine as a ligand, there was no specific binding to the phencyclidine receptor. Molecular layer was also characterized by relatively high density of a non-NMDA/non-QA displaceable glutamate binding site. We studied also the cerebellar cortex of 4 cases of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), a syndrome in which Purkinje and granule cells degenerate. In these specimens, there was significant decrement of BDZ and GABAA receptors in both molecular and granule cell layers, with loss of GABAB receptors in molecular layer. NMDA receptors were depleted in granule cell layer while QA receptors and the non-NMDA/non-QA glutamate binding site were significantly depleted in molecular layer.

Low noise images with virtually no artefacts were obtained using a maximum likelihood reconstruction technique. Tracer concentration was expressed as a fraction of the injected dose ml-1 of tumour tissue. In a first group (eight observations) maximum activity [0.9 to 5.2 (mean: 3.3) X 10(-5) of administered dose ml-1 of tumour tissue] was attained approximately 1 to 3 min post injection. This peak was followed by a clearance phase with a half-time varying between 28.3 and 112 (mean: 73.1) min. In a second group (of six cases) after an initial rapid rise of the activity, no clearance was detectable during the time of observation, tracer concentration remaining in plateau or even continuing to rise slightly. Maximum activity in this group ranged from 1.1 to 5.3 (mean: 2.6) X 10(-5) of the administered dose ml-1 of tissue.

Both glucose- and xylose-grown cells had a glucose uptake activity. On the other hand, growth on xylose was associated with the induction of a xylose permease activity, which was repressed by glucose in xylose-induced cells. The rate of sugar uptake with increasing sugar concentrations showed saturation kinetics with an apparent Km of 1.25 X 10(-5) M for glucose and 5 X 10(-3) M for xylose. Concomitant with the production of solvents, the activities of the glucose and xylose transport systems decreased. Among the main products of fermentation, butanol was shown to be a potent inhibitor of the growth of the organism and of the rate of sugar uptake as well as of sugar incorporation into cell materials. These inhibitory effects of butanol were more pronounced in xylose-grown cells than in glucose-grown cells. Butanol completely inhibited growth at a concentration of 14 g/liter for cultures growing on glucose and 8 g/liter for cultures growing on xylose. Concentrations of 7 and 10.5 g/liter of butanol caused a 50% inhibition of the xylose and glucose incorporations into cell materials. These inhibitory levels of butanol were found in typical glucose or xylose fermentation.", "PMC1469405": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected post mortem from the lateral ventricles, cisterna magna, and lumbar regions of the spinal cord of patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease were compared with those of normal, age matched control patients, patients with dementia of non-Alzheimer aetiology, and patients with non-dementing neurological disorders. The AChE activity of the ventricular CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease was 48% lower (p < 0.005) than that of age matched controls or patients with other types of dementia, and the AChE activity of CSF sampled from the basal cistern was 40% lower (p < 0.005) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. There were no significant differences between the AChE activity in Alzheimer's disease and control patients in CSF collected from the lumbar cistern. AChE activity was lower in CSF sampled from the basal and lumbar cistern of patients with dementia of non-Alzheimer aetiology, while ventricular activity was in the normal range. BuChE activity in ventricular CSF of Alzheimer's disease patients was 41% lower than normal (p < 0.05) and in the normal range in all other samples. The secretion of AChE from forebrain and hindbrain regions is reduced in Alzheimer's disease patients, leading to decreased ventricular and cisternal levels of the enzyme. Secretion from more caudal regions of the central nervous system seems to be unaffected by the disease, resulting in AChE in the lumbar CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease being in the control range. Such altered secretion of AChE in the brain could have profound implications not only for cholinergic transmission in these patients but also for the proposed noncholinergic modulatory actions of AChE.", "PMC3982104": "Determinants of physician utilization were examined using a three-generational sample of Mexican-Americans in San Antonio. A typical version of Andersen's causal behavioral model was moderately successful in predicting physician utilization in the middle and older generations and less successful in the younger generation. Consistent with the literature, need factors (health indicators) tended to affect utilization most directly. The authors also examined whether acculturation into the larger society positively influenced utilization regardless of need, as the literature suggested. While three separate measures of acculturation had no independent effects on physician utilization, acculturation did affect utilization indirectly via the need variables in the middle generation, although these effects were not consistently in the direction of greater utilization. Generational differences in determinants of physician utilization are discussed particularly in relation to the model's greater relevance for the middle and older generations.", "PMC2139229": "The primary structure of rat hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was elucidated by determining the base sequence of the complementary DNA (cDNA) of HGF. The cDNA for rat HGF was isolated by screening a liver cDNA library with oligonucleotides based on the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of the beta subunit of purified rat HGF. HGF is encoded in an mRNA of about 6 kilobases. Both alpha and beta subunits of HGF are specified in a single open reading frame for a 728-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 82,904. The N-terminal part of HGF has a signal sequence and a prosequence with 30 and 25 amino acid residues, respectively. The mature heterodimer structure is derived proteolytically from this single pre-pro precursor polypeptide. The calculated molecular weights of the alpha and beta subunits are 50,664 and 25,883, respectively, and each subunit has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The amino acid sequence of HGF is 38% identical with that of plasminogen. The alpha subunit of HGF contains four \"kringle\" structures, and the beta subunit has 37% amino acid identity with the serine protease domain of plasmin. Northern blot analysis revealed that HGF mRNA was expressed in rat various tissues, including the liver, kidney, lung, and brain.", "PMC2222665": "In this issue are analyzed the factors that support the selection of the partial edentulous patients, for the construction of partial fixed prosthesis implantosupported, and the biomechanical considerations that we have to consider in relation to: relation implant-bone, the use of natural teeth, part of the jaw, length of the space, opponent jaw and materials.", "PMC3531177": "We found that Salmonella typhimurium strain LT2 (Z) possessed two immunologically distinct, membrane-bound hydrogenase isoenzymes, which were similar in electrophoretic mobilities and apoprotein contents to hydrogenase isoenzymes 1 and 2 of Escherichia coli. The S. typhimurium enzymes cross-reacted with antibodies raised to the respective hydrogenase isoenzymes of E. coli. As for E. coli, an additional membrane-bound hydrogenase activity (termed hydrogenase 3), which did not cross-react with antibodies raised against either hydrogenase 1 or 2, was also present in detergent-dispersed membrane preparations. The physiological role of each of the three isoenzymes in E. coli has remained unclear owing to the lack of mutants specifically defective for individual isoenzymes. However, analysis of two additional wild-type isolates of S. typhimurium revealed specific defects in their hydrogenase isoenzyme contents. S. typhimurium LT2 (A) lacked isoenzyme 2 but possessed normal levels of hydrogenases 1 and 3. S. typhimurium LT7 lacked both isoenzymes 1 and 2 but retained normal hydrogenase 3 activity. Characterization of hydrogen metabolism by these hydrogenase-defective isolates allowed us to identify the physiological role of each of the three isoenzymes. Hydrogenase 3 activity correlated closely with formate hydrogenlyase-dependent hydrogen evolution, whereas isoenzyme 2 catalyzed hydrogen uptake (oxidation) during anaerobic, respiration-dependent growth. Isoenzyme 1 also functioned as an uptake hydrogenase but only during fermentative growth. We postulate that this enzyme functions in a hydrogen-recycling reaction which operates during fermentative growth.", "PMC2107488": "In a study of the quality of care in a medical case management program, five physician experts, applying criteria to medical records, found the care provided appropriate in a majority of 40 cases (10 each of head injury, spinal cord injury, high-risk infants, and AIDS).

His first contributions were in social epidemiology in the 1920s-30s, and his studies on sexually transmitted diseases, nutrition and health, and occupation and health, were seminal. He was instrumental in framing the constitutions of two key U.N. agencies, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization, and he helped shape the WHO definition of health. Following the war, as Norway's Director General of Health, he helped create one of the preeminent humanitarian democracies and its welfare state. He and his generation of public health workers were so effective because of ties to the dominant labor parties, the need for government intervention as a result of the Great Depression and the Second World War, and the humanistic reaction to the Nazi horrors. At the same time, their excessive emphasis on medical care, and the role of the physician in health policy, resulted in the great medical costs of today. Those who believe in activist government and the goal of equality in health status owe an enormous debt to Evang and his generation.", "PMC3265371": "The effect of methotrexate (MTX) on cultured T-lymphoma cells in a growing suspension was measured by microcalorimetry. The effect of the drug could be observed within 2 h after its injection into the calorimetric vessel. A dose-response curve was constructed from the calorimetric results obtained with final concentrations of MTX in the range of 0.02-2.00 microM. In another series of experiments calorimetric values were determined after 8 h of MTX-cell interaction. These data were correlated with values for cell counts during an 18 h period following the removal of the drug. A clear correlation was found between the calorimetric and cytotoxicity data. Calorimetric results obtained within 8 h of MTX-cell interaction appear to be of value in predicting the antineoplastic effect of the drug.", "PMC2646582": "A group of 10 pediatric patients had renal hyperechogenicity and reduced renal mass. The authors wish to suggest a relationship between renal hyperechogenicity and glomerular hyperfiltration according to Brenner's theory on the progressive nature of kidney disease. Reduced renal mass was related to multicystic dysplastic kidney (3 cases) nephrectomy (3 cases) and to reflux nephropathy (4 cases). The hyperechogenicity was diffuse in 6 cases with the preservation of cortico-medullary differentiation and was localized in all four cases of reflux nephropathy producing a \"pseudotumoral\" appearance. Hyperfiltration was confirmed by isotope studies in all 3 cases where it was performed. This condition together with secondary glomerulosclerosis could explain hyperechogenicity. The predictive value of such patterns are still unclear; yet such findings should lead to appropriate radiolocal, functional, clinical and dietary measures.", "PMC2233762": "Acute wheezing in infancy is a very common problem in pediatric practice. One diagnosis is RSV-bronchiolitis in the very young infant, but more often acute wheezy bronchitis will be diagnosed, which is also induced by viral infection and may be the first exacerbation of asthma. Both require the same basic therapy, but there ist no agreement about the therapy with bronchodilators. Similarly their is controversy about the use of antiviral agents for RSV-bronchiolitis.

The study reported here proves that tear production is also decreased if one drop of \"Mydriaticum Roche\" eye drops is applied. This effect was observed especially in patients who had \"normal basic tear production\" prior to treatment; however, \"Mydriaticum Roche\" did not cause a further decrease in tear production during Schirmer's test when the basic tear secretion level was already very low. Therefore, in order to avoid \"false positive\" results Schirmer's test should always be performed before instillation of atropine-active eye drops such as \"Mydriaticum Roche\".", "PMC3229093": "The in vitro activity of 10 antibiotics was determined for 231 strains of methicillin resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus. Oxacillin was a very good antibiotic to determine methicillin-resistance. Its agreement with methicillin-resistance was in all the strains tested. On the contrary, the correlation with nafcillin was established only in 95% of the strains tested. Cloxacillin and flucloxacillin are not good methicillin-resistance indicators. The strains tested against macrolides, such as erythromycin, and lincosamides, such as lincomycin and clindamycin presented a susceptibility of 68, 78, and 80%, respectively.

Concentrations of the chloroquine metabolites in the liver, heart, lungs, kidney and spleen were 34 to 250 times higher than their plasma concentrations 24 h after the drugs had been injected. Urinary excretion of the drugs was studied in rats after single intravenous administration of 2.5, 5 or 10 mg kg-1 doses. The total estimated urinary excretion of desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine was 25 and 64% respectively of the administered dose, with the maximum urinary excretion occurring on the first day.

(Their blood lead concentrations--ie, 16-64 micrograms/dl with a mean of 42--and plasma zinc and copper concentrations were significantly higher than those of control subjects). In these workers, the score of picture completion (psychological performance) was significantly low; indicators of lead absorption, but no indicators of zinc and copper absorption, were significantly correlated with this score. The score of picture completion was significantly correlated with the N11-N13 latency of SSEP (conduction time in the spinobulbar region) in the workers; their N11-N13 latency, together with the N9 and N9-N11 latencies, was significantly prolonged and was significantly correlated with indicators of lead absorption. Furthermore, their maximal motor and sensory conduction velocities of the median nerve were significantly slowed. It is concluded that both psychological performance and central and peripheral nerve conduction may be impaired in lead-exposed workers with BPb's below approximately 60 micrograms/dl.", "PMC2217149": "Sixty-one autopsy cases of splenic amyloidosis were reviewed to assess the relationship between the morphological patterns and chemical types of amyloid protein. On the basis of immunohistochemical reactions of amyloid protein, the cases were classified into 34 cases of AA and 27 of AL amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition in the spleen was divided into three major sites: the red pulp, the white pulp, and blood vessels. Red pulp involvement by amyloid was noted in 52% of the AL cases but in none of the AA cases. White pulp amyloid deposition was found in 70% of the AL and 35% of the AA cases. This difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). On the other hand, vascular deposition of amyloid was invariably noted in all cases with AA or AL amyloidosis, affecting the AA cases rather severely. These results strongly suggest that the widely held concept of deposition of amyloid as predominantly vascular in AL amyloidosis and parenchymal in AA amyloidosis requires revision. Our findings indicate that parenchymal, especially the red pulp, involvement is a consistent feature of AL amyloidosis, whereas vascular involvement is a finding common to both types of systemic amyloidosis.", "PMC3017101": "A case-control study was undertaken to assess the association between lung cancer and silicosis or silica dust exposure in white South African gold miners. Cases and controls were identified from deaths reported to the Gold Miners Provident Fund for the period January, 1979-October, 1983. Two controls were matched to each case by year of birth (+/- 2 years) and by smoking (+/- 5 cigarettes or equivalents per day) assessed 10 years (+/- 2 years) prior to death. One hundred thirty-three matched triplets were identified. The results showed no overall association between lung cancer and radiological silicosis (OR = 1.08, p = 0.92). Autopsy data indicated no overall associations between lung cancer and silicosis of the lung parenchyma (OR = 1.49, p = 0.11), the pleura (OR = 0.72, p = 0.30), or the hilar glands (OR = 0.85, p = 0.72). A trend toward increased severity of silicosis of the parenchyma was evident; however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Odds ratios for lung cancer and silicosis were higher at lower levels of cumulative silica dust exposure (ORs = 2.43, 1.72, 1.35 and 0.62 for lung cancer and autopsy silicosis of the parenchyma for the lowest, second, third, and highest quartiles of dust exposure, respectively; all p greater than 0.05). Cases did not differ from controls for total silica dust exposure, length of exposure, weighted average intensity of exposure, or number of shifts at high dust (all p greater than 0.20).

The templates were replicated by Taq DNA polymerase, recombinant rat DNA polymerase beta and mouse DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex.

The haploid genome of X. laevis contains two src genes, which can be distinguished from one another by virtue of sequence divergence in the 3' untranslated regions. Both of the genes are functional as indicated by the fact that oocytes contain RNAs transcribed from each of the genes. The two genes each encode an RNA which is 3.3 kb in length, or twice the length required to encode the 60,000 dalton src protein (pp60). Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones revealed that nearly all of the non-coding sequence is located at the 3' end. The availability of sequence data from cDNA clones has also made it possible for the first time to identify with certainty the carboxyl terminal sequence of a cellular pp60 molecule.", "PMC3581690": "Animal studies have shown that arterial baroreflexes are modulated by reflexes originating from the cardiopulmonary volume receptors, and that this modulation consists of a reduction of the inhibitory influence exerted by arterial baroreceptors on the heart and peripheral circulation. This has not been confirmed in man, however, in whom no reduction in the bradycardic response to carotid baroreceptor stimulation has been observed after the mild increase in central venous pressure (right atrial catheter) and cardiopulmonary receptor activity provided by passive leg raising. In seven normotensive subjects carotid baroreceptors were gradedly stimulated by progressively increasing carotid transmural pressure through a neck chamber device, the resulting reflex lengthening in R-R interval being measured in the two-three cardiac cycles immediately after the baroreceptor stimulus. This manoeuvre was performed in control conditions and repeated during a head-out water immersion which increased central venous pressure (right atrial catheter) from 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 12.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg (mean +/- SE), thereby providing a marked increase in the cardiopulmonary receptor stimulus. In the control condition graded stimulation of the baroreceptors caused a progressive lengthening in R-R interval, the maximal effect being + 477.4 +/- 57.2 ms. Immersion increased the R-R interval from 774.2 +/- 3.2 to 961.6 +/- 5.8 ms (P less than 0.01) and reduced mean arterial pressure (cuff measurement) from 96.0 +/- 1.0 to 82.3 +/- 0.9 mmHg. The changes in R-R interval induced by carotid baroreceptor stimulation were virtually identical with those observed in the absence of immersion.", "PMC3183086": "Mucosal lymphoid nodules were identified within the equine respiratory tract by an acetic acid fixation technique. Nodules were identified in foetuses from nine months gestational age, and estimates of total and regional nodule populations were made in foetal, neonatal and adult horses. Nodules occurred at specific sites within the tract, which probably relate to areas where inhaled antigens accumulate. The largest populations of nodules occurred in the nasopharynx and larynx, with smaller numbers in the nasal cavity, trachea and bronchi. There was an age-related change in the size of these nodule populations, with an increase in number from late gestation to the neonatal period to early adulthood (up to 5 years of age), followed by a decrease in older adults.", "PMC2678268": "Obesity is a widespread condition, with different etiologies, that is usually treated only symptomatically i.e. through lowered energy intake. The existence of a latent situation of pre-obesity is postulated. The preobese is defined as a lean individual susceptible to easily develop obesity with unlimited food availability. The physiologic and metabolic pathways responsible of the appearance of obesity are revisited, as well as the current theories on body weight regulatory mechanisms. From this information, a classification of obesities is proposed: 1) Hypothalamic, 2) Bulimic, 3) Digestive, 4) Hyperinsulinemic, 5) Hypothermogenic, 6) Hypothyroid, and 7) Set point. These conditions should not be treated therapeutically in the same way, as the causes of development of the illness are not equal.

Gel-filtered human platelets were incubated with sub-lytic amounts of the purified C5b-9 proteins and the distribution of surface antigens was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. C5b-9 assembly caused secretory fusion of the alpha-granule membrane with the plasma membrane and the release of membrane vesicles (approximately 0.1-micron diameter) that contained the plasma membrane glycoproteins (GP) GP Ib and GP IIb-IIIa as well as the alpha-granule membrane protein GMP-140. These microparticles were highly enriched in the C9 neoantigen of the C5b-9 complex. The apparent surface density of C5b-9 on the microparticles was approximately 10(3)-fold higher than on the platelet itself, suggesting that the vesicles were selectively shed from the plasma membrane at the site of C5b-9 insertion. C5b-9 induced the expression of an activation-dependent epitope (recognized by monoclonal antibody, PAC1) in GP IIb-IIIa on the platelet surface but not in GP IIb-IIIa on the microparticles. The surface of the microparticles was also highly enriched in alpha-granule-derived coagulation factor V (or Va), accounting for nearly half of all the membrane-bound factor V detected. The number of potential membrane binding sites for factor Va was probed by adding saturating concentrations of factor Va light chain. Under these conditions, the density of factor Va binding sites on the microparticle surface exceeded that on the C5b-9-treated platelet by three to four orders of magnitude. Moreover, the microparticles provided most of the membrane surface for conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by VaXa. These studies demonstrate that the microparticles shed by C5b-9-treated platelets (and not the platelets themselves) provide the principal binding sites for coagulation factor Va and the principal catalytic surface for the prothrombinase complex. Platelet-derived microparticles formed during complement activation in vivo could provide a membrane surface that facilitates the assembly and dissemination of procoagulant enzyme complexes.", "PMC2832869": "The behavioral response to amphetamine was monitored in rats that received simultaneous intraventricular infusions of saline or ascorbate. Both groups of animals displayed comparable responses, although ascorbate significantly delayed the onset of amphetamine-induced locomotion and rearing. In rats pretreated with a threshold dose of haloperidol (0.025 mg/kg), virtually all aspects of the amphetamine response were attenuated, and this effect was enhanced by ascorbate. In haloperidol-pretreated rats, ascorbate significantly lowered sniffing and forepaw shuffling throughout the amphetamine response. These results suggest that ascorbate antagonizes dopaminergic transmission by a central mechanism.", "PMC2226163": "The clinical presentation of 60 consecutive Pneumocystis carinii pneumonias in 58 HIV-infected patients (48 men, 10 women, mean age 34 [22-53] years) was prospectively evaluated from April to August 1989 and compared with 60 consecutive P. carinii pneumonias in 59 HIV-infected patients (55 men, 4 women, mean age 37.5 [22-60] years) between 1981-88. Mortality rates within 14 days after diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia were 50% (8 of 16 patients) until 1985, 20.5% (9 of 44) between 1986 and August 1988, and 1.7% (one of 60) in 1989. The degree of severity of the pneumonias at time of diagnosis was markedly lower in 1989, as shown by following parameters (averages of 1989, compared with averages of 1981-88): lactate dehydrogenase 540 (250-1419) U/l versus 680 (235-1920) U/l (not significant); alveolo-arterial difference of partial oxygen tension (pA-aO2) 22.9 (0.5-73.5) mmHg versus 39.7 (19-70) mmHg (P less than 0.001); score of radiological findings 1.4 (0-3) versus 2.7 (0-4) (P less than 0.001). In 1989, mainly clinical symptoms (dry cough: 57 of 60 cases, dyspnea: 44 of 60 cases, fever: 43 of 60 cases) initiated the diagnostic procedure: chest radiographs, lactate dehydrogenase and pA-aO2 were normal in 13, 25 and 33 episodes, respectively. The lower mortality rate of P. carinii pneumonia could not primarily be explained by therapeutical progress since the treatment of choice did not change fundamentally since 1981. Above all, early diagnosis fundamentally determined the probability of survival.", "PMC2151301": "Spatial assay of the vectorcardiograms (VCG) was performed in 85 elderly and senile patients with chronic cor-pulmonale (CCP) and in 64 patients aged 30-49 years.

Spatial vectorcardiography makes it possible not only to diagnose right ventricular hypertrophy in CCP patients but also to examine its formation over time, commencing from the early disease stages.

No significant differences in the relative amounts of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated (n-6 and n-3 series) fatty acids and in the mean polyunsaturated/saturated and linoleic/oleic ratios were observed in the different quartiles of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between individual erythrocyte fatty acids and their ratios and either blood pressure or other risk factors for atherosclerosis (age, body mass index, total serum cholesterol and triglycerides). In the multivariate analysis no independent correlations between systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the individual erythrocyte fatty acids were observed; age and body mass index were strongly related to blood pressure.

Four operations were repetitively applied to this positive pattern so that it moved fractionally to the right, grew dimmer, moved back to the left, and grew brighter again. This sequence produced a strong illusion of continuous apparent motion to the right for as long as the cycle was repeated. The small relative motion between the two patterns generated two new illusory effects: enhanced real movement (ERM) and reversed real movement (RRM). The dimming and brightening phases gave rise to reversed apparent movement (RAM). All three effects are attributed to spatial filtering by neural mechanisms, which shifts the effective position of the positive-negative contours.", "PMC2965682": "Mice inoculated with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed to Leishmania mexicana antigens were not protected from growth of a subsequent challenge infection; this was the case even when those antibodies were capable of inhibiting parasite growth in vitro. However F(ab')2 fragments of one antibody (1E1) were protective in vivo. When neonatal mice were injected with MAb and subsequently infected as adults, the animals were more susceptible to parasite growth than uninjected controls. This increased susceptibility could be adoptively transferred with Lyt-1+ cells. Separate groups of animals were immunized with different MAb to L. mexicana, and parasite growth in these animals was studied. In no case was parasite growth altered, though these mice did produce specific antibodies directed against the immunizing MAb (anti-idiotypic antibodies). When neonatal mice were injected with these latter reagents, they were found to be more resistant to challenge infection than control animals. This resistance was associated with an enhanced ability of spleen cells from these mice to produce, on stimulation with parasite antigens in vitro, a factor rendering normal macrophages cytocidal for L. mexicana.", "PMC3790422": "Patients with foreign bodies in the bronchopulmonary tree seldom remain asymptomatic for long (Abdul Majid et al. 1976).

When the two sera with heat stable opsonic activity were fractionated by gel filtration and by ion exchange chromatography, the activity copurified with IgA, not with IgG. The purified IgA, radiolabelled with 125I was shown to bind in a saturable manner to the yeast. Both sera had high levels of anti-yeast mannan IgA detected by an ELISA. In one case most of the anti-mannan activity was due to monomeric IgA, in the other it was dimeric.

MS2 RNA exerted minor inhibition on the bacterial proteolysis of regulatory subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (A-PK). The cleavage of DNA binding protein by both proteases was inhibited, in the presence of MS2 RNA and lambda DNA. In comparison, phosphatidyl serine slightly stimulated the fungal protease on the cleavage of ribonuclease T1.

In many individual patients, however, allocation into one of these groups is difficult or even impossible. The following clinical and epidemiologic observations may help in some cases to arrive at a classification; pedigree, pregnancy history (infections, teratogens, bleeding, foetal movements etc.), clinical picture and various complementary investigations. Pathogenetically, we may classify congenital structural defects into primary defects (malformations) and secondary ones, if a primarily correctly formed structure has secondarily been deformed (deformation) or destroyed (disruption). In many cases, these clinical observations will then allow a classification into one of the groups.

The remaining 15 monoclonal antibodies recognized cell surface antigens that were shared by vegetative and developing cells. Based on their relative concentrations during development, these shared antigens can be grouped into three classes. In the first class antigen concentration remained constant, in the second it decreased, and in the third it increased. Western blots of cell surface antigens were probed with monoclonal antibodies.

Ca had the highest concentration, and the second and third highest concentrations were Zn and Mg, respectively. The concentrations of Ca, Cr, Mg, Pb, Sr, and Zn were almost the same between fertile and infertile men. Ni had a lower concentration in infertile than in fertile men. Many trace elements, such as Al, Cd, Cu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Sn, and Zn, had significantly higher concentrations in infertile men with normozoospermia than in fertile men. There was a significantly positive correlation between Zn and Mg levels in fertile and infertile men.", "PMC2900305": "Noradrenaline (NA) and its major metabolite, 3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG) were measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection in five mouse brain regions after L-dopa treatment. Noradrenaline concentration increased significantly, by 30-40%, in the three terminal regions of the locus coeruleus; cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, but did not change in hypothalamus and brainstem. In mice whose central NA levels had been depleted by prior treatment with the neurotoxin, DSP-4, remaining NA neurons in these terminal regions were still able to respond with an increase in NA after L-dopa loading. The NA metabolite, MHPG, increased several-fold in all five regions in both saline and DSP-4-pretreated mice. Thus, L-dopa may be a useful precursor of NA in specific brain regions, particularly when NA is depleted.", "PMC3610324": "The enzymatic inactivation of aztreonam by the faecal flora was investigated in 25 healthy human volunteers. Ten volunteers received aztreonam orally and 15 volunteers did not receive antibiotic treatment. Residual aztreonam and its inactivated open ring form were simultaneously detected by an HPLC-assay. Independent of aztreonam treatment, beta-lactamase activity was detected in the faecal flora of 20 volunteers. The inactivation of aztreonam by the faecal supernatants was inhibited by clavulanic acid.", "PMC4741057": "Of two patients who had acute neurologic damage from cisternal punctures, one died 17 hours following a tap which produced major subarachnoid hemorrhage, the other patient recovered from probable brain stem infarction associated with cisterna magna amphotericin injection. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is the commonest major complication of cisternal puncture, with at least 30 reported fatalities. Other serious complications result from direct puncture of brain substance.Cisternal puncture is not an appropriate alternative to a difficult lumbar puncture, and indications for its use are limited. The occasional required cisternal tap should be performed only by persons carefully trained in the technique, preferably utilizing fluoroscopic guidance, and only where neurosurgical assistance is readily available.Post-puncture subarachnoid hemorrhage accompanied by progressive obtundation requires emergency evaluation and consideration of posterior fossa decompression.", "PMC2174356": "The actin severing and capping protein gelsolin contains three distinct actin binding sites. The smallest actin binding domain of approximately 15,000 Mr was originally obtained by limited proteolysis and it corresponds to the first of six repeating segments contained in the gelsolin sequence. We have expressed this domain (here termed segment 1 or N150 to define its amino acid length) in Escherichia coli, together with a series of smaller mutants truncated at either N- or C-terminal ends, in an attempt to localize residues critical of actin binding. Limited truncation of segment 1 by 11 residues at its N-terminal end has no observable effect on actin binding, but on removal of a further eight residues, actin binding is totally eliminated. Although this loss of actin binding may reflect ablation of critical residues, we cannot rule out the possibility that removal of these residues adversely affects the folding of the polypeptide chain during renaturation. Truncation at the C-terminus of segment 1 has a progressive effect on actin binding. Unlike intact segment 1, which shows no calcium sensitivity of actin binding within the resolution of our assays, a mutant with 19 residues deleted from its C-terminus shows unchanged affinity for actin in the presence of calcium, but approximately 100-fold weaker binding in its absence. Removal of an additional five residues from the C-terminus produces a mutant that binds actin only in calcium. Further limited truncation results in progressively weaker calcium dependent binding and all binding is eliminated when a total of 29 residues has been removed. Although none of the expressed proteins on their own binds calcium, 45Ca is trapped in the complexes, including the complex between actin and segment 1 itself. These results highlight a region close to the C-terminus of segment 1 that is essential for actin binding and demonstrate that calcium plays an important role in the high affinity actin binding by this domain of gelsolin.", "PMC2109119": "Several rat bioassays were conducted to evaluate protein quality and lysine (LYS) bioavailability (BIO) of Osmolite HN, a commercial enteral product, as affected by the severity of heat processing during sterilization and by storage of the products for 1 year. Without amino acid supplementation, the protein quality of Osmolite HN, as determined by protein efficiency ratio (PER), was lower than that of casein, regardless of heat treatment. With addition of the limiting amino acid, cystine, the PER of Osmolite HN was equivalent to that of cystine-fortified casein. Storage of the product for 1 year had no effect (p greater than 0.05) on PER, even though the products had darkened in color. Slope-ratio regression analysis (weight gain regressed on supplemental LYS intake) yielded a LYS BIO estimate of 94.4% for the Osmolite HN control relative to crystalline LYS. Partitioning weight gain into that resulting from LYS consumed in the basal diet and that resulting from the LYS supplement per se provided more accurate estimates of LYS BIO. This method estimated LYS BIO at 100% for the Osmolite HN products, regardless of heat treatment. With storage, LYS BIO decreased 11-12% in all of the Osmolite HN products. The decreased LYS BIO is of minimal nutritional significance in that overall protein quality of the products was not affected by storage. This is likely due to the fact that there is a plethora of lysine in Osmolite HN such that LYS is not a protein-quality limiting factor.", "PMC3169629": "Skeletal ages of patients with streak gonad syndrome were determined by the Schinz and TW2 methods as well as by bone scans. Seventy-three subjects were examined. They were classified according to their chromosomal complement, body height, chronological age and previous hormonal treatment. Retarded bone age was a common finding on the hand, wrist, hip, knees and spine with significant coexistence; however, the extent of delay in skeletal maturation on various bones differed considerably. There was no significant correlation between bone age and chronological age, karyotype, body height and previous hormonal replacements, respectively. This finding suggests that retarded skeletal maturity in streak gonad syndrome is neither the consequence of estrogen deficiency nor due to sex chromosome abnormalities and probably is not dependent on growth hormone secretion. Its pathogenesis appears to be multifactorial and remains to be determined.", "PMC3265570": "The indication of tonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis was discussed from the standpoint of clinical immunology. Elevated serum IgG was observed in 29.8% of the patients under 8 years of age preoperatively. In contrast, in 25% of patients between 9-15 years of age, serum IgG was low preoperatively. In the patients over 16 years of age no abnormal serum IgG was found, and the elevated serum IgG returned to normal after tonsillectomy. The patients with normal serum IgG preoperatively retained normal values postoperatively. The low preoperative IgG level group still remained low postoperatively. As to postoperative improving symptoms, high and low grade fever improved most (100%), followed by cervical lymphadenopathy (93%), frequent absence from school (93%), sore throat (88%) and recurrence of bronchitis (85%). The patients with recurrent tonsillitis for 8 years showing high serum IgG had indications for tonsillectomy.", "PMC3433786": "The diagnostic score of Kruis to diagnose the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has recently gained widespread application. We therefore evaluated the case histories of 373 patients attending the gastroenterological outpatient department retrospectively using the questionnaire of these authors. In contrast to Kruis et al's findings, by applying their discriminating score the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome was made in only 51% of the patients who underwent complete gastrointestinal survey without pathological findings. However, the group of IBS was significantly separable from malignant or inflammatory disease. We therefore conclude that the diagnosis of IBS should only be made by ruling out organic disease (except in the case of young people with normal physical and laboratory check up findings and a good response to treatment). For these patients we simplified the questionnaire, omitting calculations.", "PMC3572960": "Three dogs with fractures of the body of the axis showing moderate to severe displacement were presented for treatment.

Eight of 10 lesions were characterized by a markedly decreased signal of both T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences. This pattern of decreased signal intensities, when present, proved distinctive and has not been observed in other nonossified primary bone lesions. Possible etiologies for this observation are discussed.", "PMC3913757": "The putative role of the central nervous system in the maintenance of elevated blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension (EH) and renal hypertension [unilateral renal parenchymal disease (RPD) and unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS)] was studied by investigating the cardiovascular and hormonal effects of the predominantly centrally acting sympatholytic agent, clonidine. Oral clonidine lowered blood pressure substantially in all three groups. Levels of plasma renin activity were unchanged in EH and RAS but progressively fell in RPD. Plasma noradrenaline levels fell in all three groups. Clonidine therefore reduced blood pressure to the same extent in three distinct groups of hypertensives, in two of which the initiating cause was undoubtedly renal. This indicates that, although the primary cause differed, a prominent factor sustaining hypertension may have been an increase or an inappropriate maintenance of central pressor mechanisms.", "PMC3283125": "Escherichia coli dnaZX, the gene which when mutant blocks DNA chain elongation, was cloned into a lambda PL promoter-mediated expression vector. In cells carrying this plasmid, the activity that complements a mutant dnaZ extract in replicating a primed single-stranded DNA circle was increased about 20-fold. Two polypeptides of 71 and 52 kDa were overproduced. Upon fractionation, two complementing activities were purified to homogeneity and proved to be the 71- and 52-kDa polypeptides. Immunoassays revealed their respective identities with the tau and gamma subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the first 12 residues were identical in both subunits, as were their molar specific activities in dnaZ complementation. Thus, the tau subunit complements the defect in the mutant holoenzyme from the dnaZts strain as efficiently as does the gamma subunit. Inasmuch as the 71-kDa subunit (tau) can also overcome the enzymatic defect in a dnaX mutant strain, this polypeptide has dual replication functions, only one of which can be performed by the gamma subunit. Availability of pure tau and gamma subunits for study has provided the basis for proposing an asymmetry in the structure and function of a dimeric DNA polymerase III holoenzyme.", "PMC3830129": "Previous work has demonstrated the presence of a self-splicing intron in the large subunit ribosomal RNA coding region in some strains of the ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena. Sequence comparisons of the intron regions from six Tetrahymena species showed these to fall into three homology groups. In an attempt to evaluate the evolutionary origins of the intervening sequences, we have now determined complete small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences from 13 species of Tetrahymena and the absolute number of nucleotide differences between the sequences was used to construct a phylogenetic tree. This phylogeny was consistent with the groupings suggested by comparisons of other biochemical characters including cytoskeletal proteins, isozyme analyses, and restriction maps of complete rRNA transcription units. The homology groupings that were based upon the intron sequence data do not agree with the relationships inferred from the small subunit rRNA sequence data. These observations are taken to indicate that the intron character has been acquired independently in different species at a stage later than the branching out of the species.", "PMC2500149": "Recombinant fused protein containing human erythrocyte NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (cytochrome b5 reductase, EC 1.6.2.2.) was produced in Escherichia coli, which was linked to the NH2 terminus of beta-galactosidase of the vector pUC13 via a recognition sequence of alpha-thrombin. Cleavage of purified fused protein with alpha-thrombin yielded the enzyme whose apparent molecular weight (32,000) was the same as the native enzyme. The amino-acid sequence from Phe-1 to Leu-10 was determined to be identical to that of the authentic enzyme. The purified enzyme showed an identical absorption spectrum and similar catalytic properties to the native enzyme. Establishment of the expression system would make it possible to determine the reaction mechanism of the enzyme.", "PMC1599766": "The failure of fusion of splenic tissue results in the formation of accessory spleens. This entity normally appears in post-mortem examinations. The purpose of this work was to determine the incidence of the accessory spleen and to compare the ultrasonographic and tomographic features of the accessory spleen and the main spleen in a group of one thousand patients affected with several abdominal pathologies. Five hundred of these patients were studied by ultrasonography and five hundred patients by computed tomography. The ultrasonographic and tomographic features of the accessory and main spleen were similar. Its diagnosis is specially important in certain groups of patients with hematologic disease or abdominal trauma with splenic tear. This is due to the fact that the hypertrophy of the accessory spleen can produce a relapse of the disease.", "PMC3936503": "A novel amidophosphonate analog of Platelet Activating Factor (PAF), trimethyl (3-phosphonopropyl) ammonium hydroxide (R)-mono[2-acetamido-3-(hexadecyloxy)propyl] ester (PAF-AP), was synthesized.

There are many common activities within this group, especially regarding uniform documentation, which began with the elbow. Furthermore, there are standardized procedures in operative synovectomy, including new trends, e.g., arthroscopic synovectomy. Another special interest is focused on alternatives to endoprosthetic replacement, in particular on resection interposition arthroplasty. With regard to endoprosthetic replacement, the question of cementing or not is controversial; however, there are strong arguments for cementless fixation, especially for hip endoprostheses.

Most images are produced from signals of mobile hydrogen atoms in the tissues. Since bone contains few such atoms the images do not show bone material but allow marrow to be observed. Recently the technique has been extended to include spectroscopy of atoms of 31P, 13C and several others important in cell and tissue metabolism. The technique which uses a radiofrequency surface coil placed over the tissue of interest, is called topical magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy which measures phosphorus nuclei can be used to study phosphorus in muscle. The same instrument can be used to study hydrogen density distribution. It can monitor muscle metabolism during exercise and muscle energetics can thus be evaluated. MRS gives a more accurate picture of the in vivo proportions of high energy phosphates than conventional biochemical analysis, which requires muscle biopsy, it can be used to monitor living tissue in a non-destructive way.", "PMC3512304": "The hot tritium bombardment technique [(1976) Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 228, 1237-1238] was used for studying the surface localization of ribosomal proteins on Escherichia coli ribosomes. The degree of tritium labeling of proteins was considered as a measure of their exposure (surface localization). Proteins S1, S4, S7, S9 and/or S11, S12 and/or L20, S13, S18, S20, S21, L5, L6, L7/L12, L10, L11, L16, L17, L24, L26 and L27 were shown to be the most exposed on the ribosome surface. The sets of exposed ribosomal proteins on the surface of 70 S ribosomes, on the one hand, and the surfaces of 50 S and 30 S ribosomal subunits in the dissociated state, on the other, were compared. It was found that the dissociation of ribosomes into subunits did not result in exposure of additional ribosomal proteins. The conclusion was drawn that proteins are absent from the contacting surfaces of the ribosomal subunits.", "PMC3040654": "The pulsatile properties of gonadotropin and testosterone release were examined before and after chronic mu opiate receptor blockade with naltrexone, 50 mg every other day, in four normal boys in late puberty (ages 14 8/12 to 15 1/12 years). The nature of spontaneous secretory events was appraised for immunoactive LH and testosterone in blood withdrawn every 20 minutes for 24 hours, using a novel, discrete deconvolution algorithm to estimate apparent instantaneous secretory rates. The application of this methodology revealed that the frequency of discrete LH instantaneous secretory rates increased after mu opiate receptor blockade (P = 0.011). More strikingly, all parameters of testosterone secretory events responded significantly to mu opiate receptor blockade, including increases in mean estimated secretory rate (+47%, P = 0.02), testosterone pulse frequency (+ 64%, P less than 0.001) and amplitude (+ 20%, P = 0.027). Correspondingly, decreases in testosterone interpulse secretory intervals (-35%, P = 0.001), secretory pulse duration (-19%, P = 0.042) and interpulse valley duration (-35%, P = 0.006) also were noted. There was a prominent diurnal rhythm in testosterone secretion with maximal values in the morning and late evening, and marked reductions in the afternoon, sometimes to prepubertal levels. This variation in the testosterone secretory profile paralleled that of LH. In response to naltrexone, the FSH concentration series showed a significant increase in the mean FSH concentration (+ 18%) P = 0.003) and mean peak amplitude (+ 15%, P = 0.002).

Polyclonal anti-desmin antibody reacted with the cells in 7 extra-abdominal desmoid tumours, 1 palmar fibromatosis, 1 plantar fibromatosis and 3 nodular fasciitis. Monoclonal antidesmin antibody reacted with cells in only 2 desmoid tumours. Desmin-positive spindle cells were scattered throughout these lesions. There were no marked ultrastructural differences between desmin-positive and desmin-negative desmoids. All specimens except one specimen of nodular fasciitis showed immunoreactivity for alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Muscle actin-positive cells were observed in all specimens. Cultured cells gave positive reactions with polyclonal desmin antibody as well as to vimentin antibodies and two preparations of actin antibodies, whereas the original tumour did not react with desmin antibody. The present studies suggested that the cytoskeleton of some myofibroblasts in both neoplastic and reactive lesions resembles that of smooth muscle cells.", "PMC2108890": "The time- and dose-dependent effects of bovine activin A and bovine follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) suppressing protein (FSP) or follistatin on basal and FSH-induced steroidogenesis and inhibin production were studied in granulosa cells from immature, diethylstilbestrol (DES)-treated rats. In the presence of rat FSH (20 ng/ml) which stimulates aromatase activity and the production of progesterone and inhibin, activin (0.3-100 ng/ml) augmented all three parameters, whereas FSP (0.3-100 ng/ml) enhanced progesterone production and attenuated the other two parameters. In the absence of FSH, the basal parameters were unaffected by treatment with either activin or FSP alone, except for a statistically significant increase in basal inhibin in the presence of activin alone (P less than 0.05, at doses of 30 and 100 ng/ml). Neither activin nor FSP influenced the timing of the maxima of FSH-induced activities over 5 days. These findings suggest that activin and FSP, both present in follicular fluid, may play an important role in the local regulation of granulosa cell differentiation.", "PMC3413103": "A sensitive assay for the induction of carotenoid and rhodopsin synthesis, based on the phototactic response, has been developed in a mutant of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In the dark, the mutant fails to synthesize carotene and retinal, but it contains the apoprotein opsin. When retinal synthesis is induced by light treatment, the retinal combines with opsin to form rhodopsin, and the cells swim away from a source of light. Since the amount of light required to trigger a phototactic response is inversely proportional to the concentration of rhodopsin, the decrease in amount of light necessary to generate that response can serve as a measure of the amount of retinal synthesized in cells after induction. Using this assay, we found that (i) light induction of retinal depends linearly on light exposure and rhodopsin concentration during the exposure; (ii) the action spectrum of light induction is identical with that for phototaxis for which the receptor pigment is rhodopsin; and (iii) incubation with all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinal before light exposure shifts the action-spectrum peak for light induction 0.41 eV (-71 nm). We conclude that the photopigment for induction of retinal synthesis is a rhodopsin. The time lag required for induction of retinal synthesis and preliminary experiments with transcription or translation inhibitors suggest that alterations in gene expression could be involved in the induction process. Its control could be similar to other processes in which membrane receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, or growth factors regulate gene expression.", "PMC3561149": "The synthetic peptide containing residues 43-49 of alpha-gliadin, the major protein component of gluten, has previously been shown to inhibit the production of lymphokine activities by mononuclear leukocytes. We now demonstrate using radiolabeled alpha-gliadin(43-49) that human peripheral blood lymphocytes express approximately 20,000-25,000 surface receptors for this peptide, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 20 nM. In addition, binding is inhibited by naloxone and an enkephalin analog, thus confirming the functional correlate which demonstrates inhibition by these agents of alpha-gliadin(43-49) functional effects. Furthermore, B-lymphocytes bind specifically a greater amount of [125I]alpha-gliadin(43-49) than T-lymphocytes. The lymphocyte alpha-gliadin(43-49) receptor may play an important role in mediating the immunological response to alpha-gliadin.", "PMC2860225": "Microturbidimetry has been used to measure the growth of cells in suspension. Disaggregated mouse NC carcinoma cells in culture medium were added to the wells of a microtitre test plate and incubated.

Methotrexate 2-40 ng ml-1 reduced cell growth; this effect was increased by indomethacin 1 microgram ml-1, possibly by displacing methotrexate from its binding by serum protein or by enhancing cell uptake of methotrexate.

In animal systems, cyclophosphamide can reverse the tolerance and thereby facilitate immunologically mediated tumor destruction. We have applied these concepts to the immunotherapy of human malignant melanoma. Forty-three patients with metastatic disease were treated with a whole cell vaccine 3 days after intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2. The vaccine consisted of cryopreserved, irradiated autologous melanoma cells, obtained from metastatic masses by dissociation with collagenase and DNAse, mixed with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and injected intradermally. The cyclophosphamide (CY) + vaccine combination was repeated every 28 days. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) was tested by injecting 1 x 10(6) melanoma cells intradermally and measuring the diameter of induration at 48 h. Most patients had minimal pretreatment DTH responses to melanoma cells (mean +/- SE, mm = 2.4 +/- 0.5). After two vaccine treatments, the responses increased significantly (mean increase +/- SE = 12.1 +/- 1.6 p less than .001) and that level of response was maintained after 4, 6, and 8 treatments. The patients were also skin-tested with a mixture of the enzymes used to dissociate the tumors. No patients exhibited DTH to collagenase + DNAse prior to vaccine injection, but every patient developed DTH to the mixture following two treatments (mean, mm = 26.4 +/- 3.9). Although extracting viable cells from tumor tissue without the use of enzymes proved difficult, we were able to test DTH to mechanically dissociated tumor cells in 23 patients. After two vaccine treatments, there was a significant increase in DTH to enzyme-free autologous melanoma cells (mean DTH +/- SE, mm: 5.4 +/- 1.0, p less than .01). Whereas 5 of 23 patients had positive DTH responses (5 mm induration or greater) before treatment, 11 of 23 were positive after two treatments. Further significant increases in DTH enzyme-free cells were observed after 6 and 8 treatments. Thus, it appears that patients receiving CY + vaccine developed DTH to tumor-associated antigens as well as to residual collagenase and DNAse on the cell surface. Thirty-three patients could be evaluated for antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide + vaccine. There were 3 complete remissions, 1 partial remission, and 2 minor responses. Two complete responders remain alive and free of disease after 57 and 12 months, respectively, and the third died after 39 months.

The low erythrocytic levels of the metabolite, observed at day +7, might account for the failure in the prophylaxis of P. falciparum malaria with amodiaquine in a few cases.

Type 1 or alpha error has occurred if the investigator rejects the null hypothesis when it is true. For example, an experimental treatment is declared an advance over standard treatment when it is not. Type 2 or beta error has occurred if the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is false. In this case, the investigator concludes that the experimental treatment is no different than the standard when it actually is. The two types of error can be conceptualized, respectively, as the consumer's risk and the producer's risk. In many reports of clinical trial methodology, it is the producer's risk that is emphasized. It is understandable why producer's risk would be of concern to authors of clinical studies. There are, however, numerous potential sources of consumer's risk.

Mitogenic activity was isolated by a combination of cation-exchange, heparin-Sepharose affinity, and reverse-phase HPLC. Two major mitogenic fractions eluted from heparin-Sepharose at 0.8-1.3 M and 1.5-2 M. Biologically active proteins eluting at 0.8-1.3 M NaCl, after purification to homogeneity from embryonic and adult brain, were found to possess the same amino-terminal sequence as human acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). The notion that the isolated mitogens represent chick aFGF is further supported by the findings that their affinity for heparin and their retention behavior in highly resolutive HPLC are indistinguishable from those of genuine aFGF. Mitogenic activities eluting at 1.5-2 M NaCl were also present in embryonic and adult brain, but in quantities insufficient for preliminary characterization. The high specific mitogenic activity for endothelial cells, high affinity for heparin and cross-reactivity with antibodies against bovine basic FGF (bFGF) suggest a relationship of those materials with basic FGF. Our data also suggest that the sequence of aFGF is highly conserved among vertebrates. While angiogenesis occurs predominantly in the embryonic brain, the absence of notable differences in the contents of the potent angiogenic factors aFGF and bFGF in embryonic versus adult chick brain is interesting.", "PMC2955050": "Helper/inducer T cell clones specific for protein antigens and class II MHC determinants consist of two nonoverlapping subsets. One (called Th1) secretes IL 2 and IFN-gamma and the other (Th2) produces BSF1 upon stimulation with antigen or polyclonal activators. By using hapten-binding normal B cells and the B lymphoma line WEHI-279 as assays for B cell helper (maturation) factors, we have shown that Th2 clone supernatants (SN) induce differentiation to antibody secretion, whereas Th1 SN do not. The failure of Th1 SN to activate B cells is due to inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma, because it can be reversed by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody specific for IFN-gamma. Thus, in the presence of this antibody, even Th1 SN stimulate B cell maturation maximally. Conversely, recombinant IFN-gamma inhibits proliferation and differentiation of B cells induced by active Th2 SN. These results demonstrate that IFN-gamma is a potent inhibitor of B lymphocyte activation and can be distinguished from growth and maturation-inducing helper factors that are produced by both subsets of helper T cells.", "PMC2033522": "In the present study, we have examined the effects of decreasing pH from 7.0 to 6.6 on the tension developed by direct activation of the myofilaments in chemically skinned fibers from guinea pig papillary muscles. We then compared the effects of the novel inotropic agents MCI-154, pimobendan and sulmazole, which have direct action on cardiac myofilaments, on the acidic pH-induced changes in responses of the contractile system to Ca++. The reduction of pH from 7.0 to 6.8 shifted the pCa (-log[Ca++] M)-tension relation curve to the right with no change in maximum tension. However, the reduction of pH from 7.0 to 6.6 shifted the pCa tension relation curve to the right and also depressed maximum force development. These effects were reversible by returning to neutral pH (pH 7.0), but were not overcome by increasing the free [Ca++] (decreasing pCa from 4.4 to 4.0). The amplitude of pMg-ATP (-log[MgATP]M)-tension curve in the absence of free Ca++ (Ca++ less than 1 nM, bell-shaped curve) was shifted downward by reducing pH from 7.0 to 6.6. MCI-154 (1-100 microM) reversed the acidic pH-induced decrease of tension development which was activated by pCa 5.8 in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the acidosis induced reductions of maximum tension (pCa, 4.4) and pMgATP 6.0-activated tension (Ca++ less than 1 nM) were also reversed by MCI-154 (1-100 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC4629652": "Protoplasts prepared from Bacillus subtilis by lysozyme digestion lysed in the presence of pure pancreatic phospholipase A(2). The phospholipids cardiolipin, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and lysylphosphatidylglycerol, which are present in the membrane, are degraded by phospholipase A(2) only after removal of the cell wall, giving free fatty acids and lyso derivatives. The four phospholipids are hydrolyzed equally well at a given enzyme concentration. Differences in the phospholipid composition of the protoplasts were obtained by variations in the growth medium, time of harvesting, and preincubation time with lysozyme. The extent of hydrolysis appeared to depend on the initial phospholipid composition. A relative increase in acidic phospholipids in the membrane facilitated the action of phospholipase A(2), whereas the rate of hydrolysis was diminished when protoplasts were tested which contained a relatively high amount of positively charged phospholipid. Pure phospholipase C from B. cereus preferentially hydrolyzed phosphatidyl-ethanolamine in the B. subtilis membrane. More than 80% of this phospholipid was converted into diglyceride, whereas only 30% of the cardiolipin was hydrolyzed. Such a loss of phospholipids, however, was not followed by lysis of the protoplasts. Liposomes were prepared from the lipid extracts of B. subtilis and incubated with both phospholipases. The hydrolysis pattern of the phospholipids in these model membrane systems was identical to the hydrolysis pattern of the phospholipids in the protoplast membrane. Phospholipase A(2) hydrolyzed all the phospholipids in the liposomes equally well, whereas phospholipase C preferentially degraded phosphatidylethanolamine.", "PMC2247238": "We describe 2 new patients from a family in which 10 persons in 3 successive generations had a dominant neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by apathy, central hypoventilation, and parkinsonism. Neuropathologically, both patients showed severe neuronal loss and reactive gliosis in the substantia nigra. Neurochemical studies showed a marked depletion of dopamine in substantia nigra, putamen, and caudate nucleus, as well as reduction in serotonin content in the substantia nigra. Glutamate contents were low in frontal cortex and thalamus, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents were low in thalamus and substantia nigra of both patients. In addition, phosphoethanolamine contents were reduced in all brain regions of both patients, especially in the substantia nigra. One patient with severe symptoms had low levels of homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and GABA in his CSF repeatedly for 3 years before death (aged 58), while the 2nd patient died (aged 51) of an unrelated cause before developing any symptoms of the familial disorder. Because brain deficiencies of multiple neurotransmitters appear to be involved, this disorder is unlikely to respond to treatment; however, neurochemical studies of CSF may make presymptomatic diagnosis feasible.", "PMC3156697": "A non-Jewish child with late onset GM2 gangliosidosis is described. Tissues from the patient had near normal hexosaminidase A (hex A) activity using 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside (MU-glcNAc) as substrate, and deficient activity when assayed with the 6-sulphate derivative of MU-glcNAc (MU-glcNAcS) or GM2 in the presence of activator. We present evidence that this patient is a genetic compound for different alpha-subunit mutations. The father's tissues have hex A activity in the heterozygote range when assayed with MU-glcNAcS, but normal activity using MU-glcNAc; the mother's tissues have activities toward both substrates in the heterozygote range.

No evidence of CMV was found in 21 BALs. Viral inclusions, positive immunologic assays, and positive cultures were found in 14, 15, and 18 BALs, respectively. Cytological and immunologic results were closely related except in one BAL. In five BALs, a positive culture for virus was the sole criterion noted for diagnosis of CMV. The patients with both cytologically and immunologically positive results were more likely to die with or from respiratory failure (P less than .05), diffuse interstitial patterns (P less than .01), and severe acute graft-vs.-host disease (P less than .02) than were the patients without any criterion for diagnosis of CMV.

Thirty-seven unusual-appearing parathyroid tumors were found among 235 parathyroid glands identified as abnormal. There was pathologic correlation in 36. The typical appearance of parathyroid adenoma was that of an oval hypoechoic or anechoic lesion in the neck, aligned in a craniocaudal direction and often posterior to the thyroid. Morphologic variations from the norm included giant size (n = 11) (4.6%), cystic changes in a solid tumor (n = 9) (3.8%), calcified glands (n = 6[in three patients]) (2.5%), a multilobulated configuration (n = 5) (2.1%), an inhomogeneous pattern (n = 5) (2.1%), and a parathyroid cyst (n = 1) (0.4%).

External genitalia varied from Prader types II to IV. The ovotestis (11/22) was the most common gonad, and a marked variation in macroscopic and microscopic appearances with five patterns of distribution of gonadal tissue was noted. Ovulation was observed in ovarian tissue, and spermatogonia, but no spermatozoa, in testicular tubules. A hypothesis is developed suggesting abnormal testicular differentiation, and a model is presented to explain observed patterns of gonadal tissue distribution. A uterus was present in all cases, but a hemiuterus or lateralized uterus was noted in the 5 cases in which only testicular or predominantly testicular tissue was observed on the contralateral side. Karyotype analysis showed 46 XX in 5 cases (1 with an H-Y antigen) and a mosaic involving 46 XY in the remaining 5.

A new SP6 transcription subcloning vector, pCKSP6, has been constructed, in which a gene can be inserted precisely at the transcription initiation site. This was achieved by bringing the BamHI cleavage site into the initiation site. When DNA ends of both insert gene and BamHI cleaved pCKSP6 are made blunt-ended using a single strand specific nuclease, the in vitro transcripts of the recombinant DNA by SP6 RNA polymerase will contain only the gene sequence immediately after the initiation base G. Mung bean nuclease was used to generate a series of mutants resulting from step-wise deletion of single base pairs around the initiation site. Transcription assays with these SP6 promoter mutants revealed that not only the sequence immediately upstream of the initiation site but also the six base pairs from position +1 to +6 are important elements for promoter binding and/or transcription initiation activity. Furthermore, there appears to be a hierarchy of importance of each base pair in the order of position +1 greater than +2 greater than +3 greater than +4, +5, +6, -1, -2.", "PMC2139889": "Non-lymphoid cells play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of cellular immune responses. Using in-situ immunohistochemical techniques and a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mcabs) reactive with B5-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver biopsies, we analysed the non-lymphoid cell component in inflammatory infiltrates in 20 cases of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In addition, lymphocyte subsets and HLA-DR antigens were studied. Mcab KP1 labelled scattered Kupffer cells, which variably expressed HLA-DR antigens. Their random distribution and lack of significant topographical association with lymphocytes suggest that classical Kupffer cells do not play a major role in cell-mediated immune reactions. On the other hand, mcab Mac387 was unreactive with normal liver tissue but labelled HLA-DR+ dendritic cells in areas of intralobular inflammation. On (immuno)electron microscopy, these Mac387+ dendritic cells were situated in the Disse space, where they formed close contacts with lymphocytes. Similar dendritic cells were situated at the edge of portal tracts in cases of chronic active, but not chronic persistent hepatitis. Immunostaining on serial frozen sections revealed their close topographical association with cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells, suggesting that Mac387+ HLA-DR+ dendritic cells play an immunomodulatory role in the effector arm of the cellular immune response that takes place in the periphery of portal tracts and the lobular parenchyma, and that involves activation and proliferation of cytotoxic T cells.

We report a prospective study of 43 documented cases of acute maternal Toxoplasma infections acquired during gestation in which the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was evaluated for diagnosis of fetal infection and compared with the current standard methods. On the basis of direct lysis of pelleted amniotic fluid cells followed by amplification of a gene sequence specific for T. gondii, PCR correctly identified the presence of T. gondii in five of five samples of amniotic fluid from four proven cases of congenital infection. PCR also detected three of five positive cases from a nonprospective group. The two diagnostic methods of comparable speed, detection of specific immunoglobulin M from fetal blood and and inoculation of amniotic fluid into tissue culture, correctly identified only 3 and 4 of the 10 positive samples, respectively. The considerably more time-consuming methods of mouse inoculation of amniotic fluid and fetal blood both detected 7 of 10 positive samples. There were no false-positive diagnoses by any of the methods. Therefore, detection of T. gondii by PCR appears to be the most promising method for prenatal diagnosis of congenital Toxoplasma infection, since it is both extremely rapid and highly sensitive.", "PMC2362213": "A nurse administrator and a nurse educator, already linked in collaborative efforts, developed a creative response to their concerns of recruitment and retention of nursing staff and nursing students.

Expression of the soluble H-2Kk antigen in the transgenic mice was demonstrated in cell supernatants of biosynthetically labeled splenic and thymic Con A blasts as well as bone marrow-derived macrophages. Soluble H-2Kk molecules were also present in the sera of the transgenic animals. No cell-surface expression of the H-2Kk antigen could be observed. In spite of the presence of the soluble H-2Kk molecules in the transgenic mice, the animals were able to generate H-2Kk-specific cytolytic T cells as well as antibody responses when stimulated with cell-surface-bound H-2Kk antigens.

Tertatolol 5 mg, aspirin 1 g, tertatolol 5 mg together with aspirin 1 g and placebo were administered at 1-week intervals in a random order and in a double-blind fashion. Cardiac output was measured by Doppler echography and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by constant infusion techniques using (123I) iodohippurate and (51Cr) EDTA, respectively. Measurements were performed before and then successively 2 and 4 hours after oral intake of drugs or placebo. Tertatolol decreased cardiac output by 22% (P less than .05) and heart rate by 17% (P less than .05) without change in blood pressure, renal blood flow, and GFR. The same effects occurred when tertatolol was given together with aspirin. Either placebo or aspirin alone had no effect on systemic and renal hemodynamics. These results suggest that cardiac output is redistributed to the kidneys after tertatolol intake in normal humans. This favorable effect on renal hemodynamics is probably not mediated by a local release of vasodilating prostaglandins.", "PMC3676397": "Binding of monoclonal antibody MHS-5 to western blots of human seminal plasma was employed to follow the fate of a seminal vesicle-specific antigen (SVSA) during semen liquefaction. Ejaculates from four vasectomized donors were collected in a manner to inhibit liquefaction or to allow liquefaction to proceed at room temperature. Aliquots of the liquefying seminal fluid were removed at specific time points and further liquefaction inhibited with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody MHS-5 demonstrated that the SVSA epitope in all donors was located on multiple bands ranging in mass from 15-92 kDa in unliquefied ejaculates; immunoreactive peptides below 15 kDa were not detected. As early as 5 min post ejaculation, immunoreactive bands below 15 kDa were identified in liquefying samples. During the same time period (5 min), immunoreactive bands of 69-71 and 58 kDa could not be immunologically detected in liquefying samples. A decrease in immunoreactive staining of components higher molecular mass was accompanied by a concomitant increase in immunoreactive staining of intermediate and small molecular mass molecules during the first 2 h of liquefaction. After 8-24 h of liquefaction, two immunoreactive bands of 10.9 and 12.5 kDa predominated. Between 24 and 48 h, each donor's ejaculate demonstrated a common single immunoreactive band of 10.9 kDa.

Eleven gilts were ovariectomized and allotted by weight to dietary doses of 50, 150 or 350 micrograms Z/kg BW daily for 3 d. All doses of Z increased height of the vaginal epithelium. Height of the vaginal epithelium in gilts fed 150 or 350 micrograms Z/kg BW increased more than that in gilts fed 50 micrograms Z/kg BW. Twenty-four gilts then were ovariectomized and allotted to be immunized or not immunized. A Z-bovine serum albumin conjugate was injected into gilts to achieve immunization. Ten weeks after initial immunization, antibodies to Z were detected after a 1:10(7) dilution at greater than .1 absorbance units using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and gilts were allotted by weight to diets with no Z or 150 micrograms Z/kg BW daily for 3 d. Immunization alone had no effect on height of vaginal epithelium, but after 3 and 10 d, immunized gilts fed Z had higher vaginal epithelium than did nonimmunized gilts fed Z. Immunized gilts excreted a larger percentage of ingested Z than nonimmunized gilts did.

Using the clinical information available, a 'healthy' sub-group was extracted. The individual distributions of birthweight (BW), birth length (BL) and birth headcircumference (BHc) at each week of gestational age (GA) were modelled following some truncation of their ranges. Application of the Box-Cox power family of transformations was generally found to improve the normality of the data. Certain percentages (such as 2.28, 50 and 97.72) were linked through a smoothing device. Features of the results include a positively skewed BW distribution in most GA weeks, a normal positively skewed BW distribution in most GA weeks, a normal distribution of BL and BHc at term, a larger relative variation in BW at lower GA than at term, and a distinct sigmoid shape of the median and other BW curves. Compared with five commonly quoted standards, the present data show the least deceleration in the fullterm region. Disregarding the clinical information, 'primary' sub-groups were also extracted using decomposing techniques. These gave rise to similar BW/GA relationships.

The amplitude envelope is one parameter encoded by the Tickle Talker, an electrotactile speech processor for the hearing impaired which stimulates the digital nerve bundles with a pulsatile electric current. Psychophysical experiments measuring the duration discrimination and identification, gap detection, and integration times for pulsatile electrical stimulation are described and compared with similar auditory measures for normal and impaired hearing and electrical stimulation via a cochlear implant. The tactile duration limen of 15% for a 300-ms standard was similar to auditory measures. Tactile gap detection thresholds of 9 to 20 ms were larger than for normal-hearing but shorter than for some hearing-impaired listeners and cochlear implant users. The electrotactile integration time of about 250 ms was shorter than previously measured tactile values but longer than auditory integration times. The results indicate that the gross amplitude envelope variations should be conveyed well by the Tickle Talker.

At basal states there are two forms: A-receptors of approximately 94 kDa and B-receptors which are triplets of approximately 114, 117, and 120 kDa. All the proteins bind hormone and are phosphorylated. By using PR-rich T47Dco human breast cancer cells, pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine, and receptor immunopurification with anti-PR monoclonal antibodies, we show that PR are synthesized as single B-proteins of 114 kDa and single A-proteins of 94 kDa. The mature B-triplets form 6-10 h later by post-translational phosphorylation at sites restricted to the B-proteins. This slow maturation is not required for PR activation to hormone binding states, however, since A- and B-receptors that are less than 15 min old respond to progestins by undergoing transformation and nuclear binding accompanied by a rapid secondary phosphorylation common to both proteins. These studies explain the complex structure of the mature human B-receptors and the transformed A- and B-receptors, and address issues dealing with A- and B-proreceptor synthesis and receptor activation rates.", "PMC4833827": "Acoustic transients can be thermally generated in water by pulsed microwave energy.

There were no significant alterations in aspartate, taurine, or alanine levels in any of the regions examined. Widespread significant reductions in cortical GABA concentrations were observed in the Alzheimer's brains, with the largest decreases in the temporal lobe. Overall values for glutamate concentrations in temporal and frontal cortices showed a significant 12% reduction in Alzheimer's brains, but the only individual cortical region showing a significant reduction in glutamate was the inferior temporal gyrus.

However, a more transient contraction can be obtained by release of Ca2+ from a cellular store, possibly the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In spike generating smooth muscle (e.g., guinea-pig taenia caeci), spike discharges may trigger the release of cellular Ca2+ by activating a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism. Caffeine directly activates this mechanism in the absence of a triggered Ca2+ influx. In contrast to this, maintained depolarization may not only release but also refill the Ca2+ store. Drug-receptor interactions also release Ca2+ from a cellular store. This release may be elicited with inositol trisphosphate produced by receptor-linked phosphoinositide turnover. In non-spike generating smooth muscle (e.g., rabbit thoracic aorta), maintained membrane depolarization does not release but, instead, fills the Ca2+ store. However, caffeine and receptor-agonists release the Ca2+ store - possibly by activating the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism and phosphoinositide turnover, respectively. The Ca2+ store in smooth muscle is filled by Ca2+ entry through voltage dependent Ca2+ channels and also by resting Ca2+ influx in the absence of receptor-agonists. The Ca2+ entering the cells through these pathways may be accumulated by the Ca2+ store and may activate the contractile filaments.", "PMC2816670": "A sample of deafened adults in Ontario, Canada provided information about the general course of their adjustment to acquired hearing loss.

Results indicate that while depressed patients differed from controls only on the emotion-labeling task, those with schizophrenia showed deficits on all four tasks when compared with controls and did worse than patients with depression on the emotion tasks.

The purified protein was used to raise antisera in two rabbits. Treatment of the antisera with ammonium sulphate followed by gel chromatography led to an immunoglobulin fraction which was used to coat latex particles by physical adsorption. The latex suspension was used in an automated system including an optical particle counter to analyse the protein in serum, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. Serum contains 5.8 mg of beta 2-microglobulin/l, of which 33% is found as a 55000 dalton complex while 66% is present as the 'free' protein. The daily urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin in females is about 2 micrograms of which 7% is found to be a 65000-dalton complex while 92% is the free protein. From this, it can be calculated that the fractional urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin is about 0.03%. The cerebrospinal fluid contains about 1 mg of beta 2-microglobulin/l. Preliminary tests also suggest that the method can be adapted for non-automated turbidimetric detection. In the automated assay, the within- and between-assay coefficients of variation are less than 10% for the three biological fluids tested. The analytical recovery in the urine is 93%. In urine, beta 2-microglobulin undergoes proteolytic degradation at pH below 6.

In addition, the predictive validity of the brief version was compared with that of the standard CST. Both versions of the test exhibited significant relationships with staff decisions. However, the reliability of the brief version was lower than that of the standard CST because of the smaller number of items involved.

In nonlogarithmic cultures of NC64A most cells had accumulated in G1 phase, while in logarithmic cultures a peak containing cells in S phase and mitosis could be distinguished from the larger G1 peak. However, symbiotic algae showed a single broad peak in which there was no clear distinction between G1 and S phase/mitosis. When hydra were starved for a prolonged period, inhibiting host cell and algal division, the DNA content of the symbiotic algae slowly increased, and the number of daughter cells produced after a single feeding increased with the length of the preceding period of starvation. This suggests that symbiotic algae are able to cycle slowly through S phase, but unless the host is fed they cannot traverse into mitosis and complete the cell division cycle. No significant difference in cell size was found between algae producing either four or eight daughter cells after 1-day- or 22-day-starved hydra were fed, suggesting that algal cell size did not determine the number of daughter cells produced. Instead, this may be dependent upon the length of time the cell had spent in S phase prior to receiving the, as yet unknown, stimulus to enter into mitosis.", "PMC2535898": "SV40 mutants bearing either amino acid substitution or in-frame deletion/insertion mutations in a region of the gene for large T antigen encoding a stretch of hydrophobic residues were analyzed for their behavior in permissive and nonpermissive cells. One of the mutants, with an Ile(573)-Phe substitution had a phenotype indistinguishable from that of wild-type SV40. The remaining three mutants were not viable and were defective for DNA replication. In addition, they displayed a cell-type specificity with respect to transformation; namely, they transformed the mouse C3H10T1/2 cell line, although with a reduced efficiency relative to wild-type, but were unable to transform the rat REF52 cell line. None of the T antigens from the defective mutants formed a complex with the cellular protein p53, indicating that the T-antigen-p53 complex is not required for the transformation of C3H10T1/2 cells.", "PMC3181827": "Any analysis of the stability of the distal radio-ulnar joint should consider the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon.

Based on a retrospective study of 80 patients with malignant melanomas of the choroid or ciliary body, in which pre-enucleation irradiation with 8.5 Gray or 20 Gray was performed, no beneficial effect could be found in terms of better survival. The need for a prospective, randomized and possibly multicentered study is emphasized.", "PMC2138528": "We have investigated the development of substrate-based inhibitors of complement enzymes. Sequences around the scissile Arg77-Ser78 bond of C3 have been synthesized and tested as inhibitors of C3 convertase. The best inhibition was found with the tetrapeptide Ac-Arg-Ser-Asn-Leu-OH (H-576); extending this sequence in either direction reduced inhibitory activity. Preliminary experiments with peptides in which the scissile bond--CO--NH--was replaced with non-hydrolysable moieties such as--CO--CH2--(H-497) and--CH2--NH--(H-336) failed to show enhanced inhibition. One of the longer chain inhibitors H-416 containing DArg77-Ser78 was unexpectedly found to potentiate iC3 cleavage by factors I and H but did not inhibit the intact alternative pathway. The same peptide also bound to factor H. It is concluded that the binding requirements of the C3 convertase are more sophisticated than can be satisfactorily imitated simply by linear sequences around the scissile bond of C3.", "PMC3877656": "Examinations of the rat kidney metabolism were carried out by histological (staining with haematoxylin and eosin), histochemical (response to lactate and succinic dehydrogenases activities), and electrophoretic methods (separation of isoenzymes of lactate dehydrogenase) after treating animals with the sulphonamide Biseptol 480, for 7 (consecutive) d by stomach tube.

The adhesins involved in the attachment of the bacteria to each of these cells were proteinaceous but showed marked differences after various chemical or physical treatments, indicating that separate adhesins were present. Haemagglutinating strains were more hydrophobic than tissue-culture-adherent strains. Haemagglutination of human red blood cells by strains of G. vaginalis was inhibited by galactose, lactose, N-acetylneuraminic acid and phosphatidylserine.

Abdominopelvic irradiation was not effective in patients with limited residual disease at second-look laparotomy (3 year survival--34.3% and median PFI from second-look laparotomy--4.8 months). Even in patients with a negative second-look laparotomy the median PFI was only 13 months from this operation and the 3-year survival was 87.5%.

Fifty-eight percent of the patients who had made threats before admission required seclusion for dangerous behavior in the hospital, and 32 percent of the patients who had made threats physically assaulted someone in the hospital. The association between preadmission threats and subsequent violence was especially strong among schizophrenic patients. Compared with schizophrenic patients who did not threaten others, those who had made preadmission threats were more likely to be physically and verbally assaultive and were more likely to require seclusion.

Bile composition in patients after liver transplantation also showed that bile was supersaturated with cholesterol in the early postoperative period while the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids was interrupted by a draining T tube. However, further study of patients showed a poor correlation between bile composition and the development of biliary complications. An analysis of bile 'sludge' showed that after transplantation two types were encountered. The first, containing large quantities of unconjugated bilirubin, was present when intrabiliary obstruction was associated with long-standing mechanical obstruction. The second type, present in patients developing masses of intrabiliary 'sludging' shortly after transplantation, consisted mainly of necrotic donor biliary tract due to damage during preservation. An intrabiliary perfusion technique was developed which in animal models reduced the extent of donor biliary damage.", "PMC2532732": "A clinical outcome follow-up comparison of treatment and nontreatment groups was conducted to investigate both the clinical and cost effectiveness of a hospital-based industrial medicine division offering inpatient pain treatment clinical services.

The results indicate that the rate of duplication of the maroon-like locus is on the order of 2.7 X 10(-6); that the rate of duplication of the rosy locus is approximately 1.7 X 10(-4); and that duplication occurs in males, suggesting that there may actually be two modes of gene duplication in Drosophila melanogaster.", "PMC2229381": "A tandemly repeated 1,046-base-pair (bp) ClaI DNA fragment from Bordetella pertussis was cloned into Escherichia coli by using the vector pUC19. This fragment, when isolated, hybridized strongly to DNA from all 100 clinical isolates of B. pertussis tested. It was shown to have homology to single-copy sequences in Bordetella bronchiseptica but not Bordetella parapertussis and did not hybridize to lysate blots of a wide range of other bacteria, including members of the closely related genera Pasteurella, Alcaligenes, and Haemophilus. The 1,046-bp fragment was sequenced, and complementary synthetic oligonucleotides flanking a 153-bp region within the repeated element were used as primers for specific amplification of this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This procedure was then applied to the rapid (5-h) detection of B. pertussis in nasopharyngeal secretions collected from 332 children with suspected pertussis. The test yielded positive results in a total of 98 samples, compared with 66 for culture and 33 for direct immunofluorescence (IF). All of the IF-positive samples were PCR positive, as were 63 of the samples from which B. pertussis was eventually cultured. Two hundred thirty-one specimens which were negative by IF and culture were also negative in the PCR assay. However, 33 culture- and IF-negative specimens were positive by PCR assay.

In 78% of the cases, there were findings consistent with esophageal injury, but there was a delay in diagnosis in two thirds of these. The diagnostic difficulty was due to lack of a specific symptom complex for esophageal perforation. Often esophageal perforation was not suspected and the symptoms were attributed to the more common injuries, or the diagnostic workup was incomplete.

The current methods for prenatal diagnosis are as follows: Amniocentesis, fetoscopy, fetal blood sampling, biopsy of fetal skin, and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). The method for growing fetal cells obtained by amniocentesis in short term culture and karyotyping has opened a new area to chromosomal anomalies. By using cultured amniotic fluid cells in larger numbers, it is also possible to diagnose many metabolic disorders. Fetoscopy has been developed which permits the perinatologist to enter the uterus and obtain tissue sample or to actually view the fetus. However, it is very difficult to visualize the fetus directly through fetoscope. Only specific parts of the fetus can be readily identified, but a total examination of surface anatomy is rarely possible. Now ultrasonography with improved resolution can clearly define many major anatomical abnormalities without apparent risk. And also, fetal blood sampling and skin biopsy have been successfully performed under ultrasound guidance rather than under direct fetoscopic visualization. Recently, the advent of fetal blood sampling has made it possible to diagnose genetic disorders which have hitherto been impossible to recognize in the fetus. The main applications are for the prenatal diagnosis of the fetal infection, coagulopathies, hemoglobinopathies, and muscular dystrophies. Several severe genodermatoses result in early death or are associated with significant morbidity. Some of these disorders can be diagnosed in utero with skin biopsies.

The separation of murein building blocks with high performance liquid chromatography reveals about 80 different types of muropeptides. Their behavior in high performance liquid chromatography and their chemical structure are described. The complexity of E. coli murein is due to the free combination of seven different types of side chains (L-Ala-D-Glu-R with R = -OH, -m-A2pm, -m-A2pm-D-Ala, -m-A2 pm-Gly, -m-A2pm-D-Ala-D-Ala, -m-A2pm-D-Ala-Gly, -m-A2pm-Lys-Arg) with two types of cross-bridges (D-Ala-m-A2pm, -m-A2pm-m-A2pm). The novel type of cross-bridge, A2pm-A2pm, contains an L,D-peptide bond, as shown by Edman degradation and chemical analysis of the reaction products. The A2pm-A2pm cross-bridge is assumed to play a role in the adaptation of the cross-linkage of murein to different growth conditions of the cell.

In addition, we tested retrospectively the ability of PBL of recipients engrafted for more than 1 yr to produce IL-2. IL-2 levels were assessed on the IL-2-dependent CTL-L2 murine cell line. Our data show: 1) before grafting, hemodialysed patients (N = 14) produced normal IL-2 yield compared with healthy donors (N = 21); 2) the IL-2 secretion of PBL of recipients with good graft function (N = 18) is decreased markedly during roughly the first 12 months following transplantation (P less than 0.01); 3) when acute rejection crisis occurred during this time period (N = 24), a sharp and highly significant increment (P less than 0.01) in lectin-induced IL-2 production of recipient's PBL was seen. After 1 yr, the capacity to secrete IL-2 upon lectin stimulation tends to be restored.

Animals were sacrificed sequentially at 8-week intervals from week 8 to week 104, and the carcinogenic effects of BHA on the forestomach were examined histopathologically. Papillomas and carcinomas were found in rats, hamsters and mice. In rats, papillomas first appeared in week 8 in the group given the higher level of BHA and in week 56 in that given the lower level. The first carcinoma was observed in week 48 in rats given the high level, while no carcinoma was observed in rats given the lower level. In hamsters, papillomas appeared in week 8 in both BHA-treated groups, and in both groups, the incidence of papillomas was much higher than in BHA-treated rats. Squamous cell carcinomas were observed in 4 hamsters (10.0%) among those that survived more than 64 weeks on treatment with the higher level of BHA and in 4 (7.3%) among those treated with the lower level. In mice, papillomas were induced by BHA in both BHA-treated groups after more than 88 weeks.

The detergent solution used for extraction consisted of 10 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 0.25% (wt/vol) polyoxyethylene 20 cetyl ether (Brij 58), and 0.025% (wt/vol) polyoxyethylene 17 cetyl stearyl ether (Lubrol WX) in the presence of 30% (wt/vol) glycerol as a stabilizer. The molecular weight of the receptor was estimated to be 1,800K by Sephacryl S-500 gel filtration and 800K by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. The equilibrium dissociation constant of [3H]nitrendipine to the solubilized receptors was 5.6 nM, which is approximately 10 times that of the membrane-bound receptor. The binding of nitrendipine to the receptor was inhibited noncompetitively by the structurally unrelated calcium channel inhibitors verapamil and prenylamine; their concentrations for 50% inhibition were both 1.0 X 10(-7) M, and they caused maximal inhibitions of 70 and 100%, respectively.", "PMC3799481": "The effectiveness of indoor climate as a mitigation measure for indoor formaldehyde contamination was studied in a mobile home. The effects of nine indoor climate regimes on formaldehyde levels were evaluated for the temperature and humidity ranges of 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C and 30% RH to 70% RH. Formaldehyde levels at the lowest combination of temperature and relative humidity (20 degrees C, 30% RH) were only 20% of those measured at the highest combination of temperature and relative humidity (30 degrees C, 70% RH) evaluated. Reducing temperature alone (from 30 degrees C to 20 degrees C) was shown to result in an approximate 70% reduction in formaldehyde levels. Reducing relative humidity alone (from 70% to 30%) resulted in an approximate 40% reduction in formaldehyde levels. A high linear correlation was observed between formaldehyde levels and temperature and between formaldehyde levels and relative humidity. Analysis of energy consumption and associated costs indicated that temperature reduction from 25 degrees C to 20 degrees C during the cooling season would increase energy usage costs by about 20%; temperature reduction in the heating season would result in both reduced formaldehyde levels and reduced energy costs. Although effective, humidity control--particularly to 30% under summertime conditions--appears to be prohibitively costly. The relationship between temperature and formaldehyde levels suggests that climate control also may be appropriate for reducing indoor levels of other continuously generated contaminants.", "PMC2174157": "After 15 years of unsuccessful attempts, the most frequent of non-A non-B (NANB) hepatitis viruses has recently been identified and designated HCV. It is by an original and direct molecular biology approach, leading to the cloning of nucleic acids presumed to be present in an infectious plasma, that this virus could be partially characterized. The viral genome was sequenced before the agent could be detected by serology or electron microscopy. HCV is a small RNA virus with a lipid capsid, and it might be indirectly related to the flaviviruses. A non-structural, 363 aminoacid protein, corresponding to a virus replication enzyme, is the specific component originally used for the Elisa tests, now available for the serological diagnosis of HCV infection. Serological tests have shown that HCV is the most frequent of NANB viruses, being responsible for 60 to 80 percent of post-transfusion hepatitis. Anti-HCV antibodies develop slowly: in 40 percent of the cases they appear 2 to 12 months after the transaminase peak associated with primary infection, i.e. during convalescence. Among patients with chronic hepatitis, 60 to 80 percent of presumably NANB cases are positive for anti-HCV antibodies. The same applies to cirrhotic patients with or without cancer, 40 percent of whom are HCV positive. In France, the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies among blood donors is 0.68 percent, and from March 1, 1990 testing for HCV has become compulsory. Among the groups at risk, prevalences are 70 percent in haemophiliacs, 50 to 75 percent in drug addicts and more than 30 percent in patients under haemodialysis. Sexual transmission seems to be rare but possible; 5 percent of homosexuals are HCV antibody carrier, and this proportion is higher in those who are HIV positive. We already know that some HCV positive subjects are not infectious and that some asymptomatic blood donors carry a serologically undetected HCV; the liver of at least 10 percent of patients with chronic NANB hepatitis without anti-HCV antibodies contains the RNA of HCV detectable by molecular amplification. All this leads to the concept of HCV negative viral hepatitis. The fact that the hepatitis C virus was discovered at about the same time than interferon clearance for marketing, is an exceptional public health opportunity which should generate specific programs.

The modulus of elasticity for the complex averaged across all locations was 6.0 +/- 2.8 x 10(5) N m-2 and the average stress at failure was 3.3 +/- 1.3 x 10(5) N m-2. The modulus of elasticity for scleral strips also varied with location and averaged 2.9 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) N m-2 for anterior sclera and 1.8 +/- 1.1 x 10(6) N m-2 for posterior sclera at stress levels ranging from 20- to 260 x 10(4) N m-2. There was a significant correlation of scleral stiffness with age (P less than 0.05, r = 0.80). The elastic properties of the choroidal complex may be relevant to the pathogenesis of a variety of ocular diseases, including macular degeneration, angioid streaks, choroidal folds, and choroidal ruptures.", "PMC3051818": "The authors analyse the records of 60 children who had a failed Kasai procedure and were referred for liver transplantation between 1984 and 1986. By the end of 1987, 45 had been transplanted, eight had died before transplantation, four had been excluded while three were still waiting for a potential donor. Actuarial survival at 2 and 3 years of the 30 children with a follow-up greater than one year is 79 +/- 8%. Nowadays, the surgical therapy of biliary atresia should include liver replacement. The original porto-enterostomy (one Roux-en-Y loop, no stoma) according to Kasai should remain the first surgical procedure performed under 8 weeks by a trained surgeon. Good long-term results can be expected in 30 to 40%. In case of straight failure, liver replacement should be recommended in early age and, in case of delayed failure, before the age of 6 to avoid chronic disabling.", "PMC4944181": "A total of 1537 strains of Salmonella typhimurium belonging to seven prevalent phage types were examined on solid media for their ability to ferment rhamnose, xylose and inositol, for colicine production and for nutritional requirements. Most of the strains in each phage type were almost completely homogeneous, especially in their sugar fermentation reactions. However, strains of phage type 1 a/2 were not homogeneous, but could be assigned to one of four subgroups on the basis of ability to ferment inositol, inhibition of growth by meso-tartrate and auxotrophy for nicotinic acid. The subdivision proved to have epidemiological value. The inhibition of growth by meso-tartrate was observed on a defined medium containing citrate as the energy source. Inhibition did not occur if glucose, casein hydrolysate or aspartic acid were added to the medium.", "PMC3058889": "In this review, we demonstrate how differentiated membrane domains can be detected in epithelial cells using conventional light and electron microscopy, freeze-fracture electron microscopy and the immuno- and cytochemical detection of membrane components. Using specific examples from the kidney, we show how the polarized insertion of these components into either apical or basolateral plasma membrane regions on either side of the tight junction barrier is related to specific functions of principal and intercalated cells in the collecting duct. In addition, distinct basal and lateral membrane domains have been revealed in some cells that are maintained in the absence of a tight junctional barrier in the plane of the membrane. This suggests that other factors, possibly related to cytoskeletal elements, may be involved in the functional segregation of these membrane areas. We propose that epithelial cell plasma membranes should be subdivided into apical, lateral and basal regions, and that the term \"basolateral\" may be an oversimplification.", "PMC3707056": "Chromosome analysis was performed on Friend leukemia cells sensitive and resistant to doxorubicin. With increasing levels of resistance, increased numbers, of metacentric chromosomes and several chromosomal markers were observed. When sensitive cells were exposed to a toxic dose of doxorubicin, multiple chromosomal breaks were observed in 62% of cells. In contrast, when doxorubicin resistant cells were exposed to cytotoxic concentrations, the pulverization phenomenon was not observed. This striking difference suggests a different mechanism for cytotoxicity in sensitive and resistant cells. Moreover, when logarithmically growing cells were grafted subcutaneously in DBA2 mice, the tumorigenic property was related to the level of doxorubicin resistance.", "PMC3598806": "Chickens were dosed orally with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, or E. praecox and the subsequent presence, in various tissues, of parasites capable of inducing patent infections was detected by transferring the tissues to coccidia-free recipients. Similar results were obtained with each of the 4 species studied, irrespective of whether initial development occurs in the superficial (E. praecox, E. brunetti) or crypt (E. acervulina, E. maxima) epithelium. Infection was transferable by gut scrapings and liver homogenates at all time intervals (3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postinoculation) studied. Infection was also transferable with blood and with splenic homogenates but not consistently. Transfers made within a short time of the inoculation of donors were more successful in producing patent infections in the recipients. In all transfers the prepatent period was normal for the species. These findings suggest that sporozoites enter the mucosa very shortly after inoculation, and some of them pass to the liver and spleen and then leave these tissues at a somewhat slower rate, possibly to reenter the mucosa. Sporozoites in the lamina propria of the gut were found within host mononuclear cells in all 4 species studied. Most of the cells harbouring E. maxima and some of those with E. praecox were identified as intraepithelial lymphocytes while all others could only be identified as agranular mononuclear cells that were not characteristically macrophages.", "PMC4038341": "The influence of the anionic drugs indomethacin, barbitone, salicylate and the cationic drugs chlorpromazine and tetracaine on the morphology of human erythrocytes suspended in solutions of different chloride concentration (thus altering cell membrane potential) and constant osmolality, has been examined. As expected, the anionic and cationic drugs produced echinocytes and stomatocytes respectively in 145 mM NaCl. The cationic drugs induced fewer stomatocytes in 60 mM chloride than in 145 mM chloride at 37 degrees. Tetracaine induced echinocytes in 60 mM chloride at 20 degrees. Indomethacin and barbitone produced echinocytes in 145 mM chloride and stomatocytes in 60 mM chloride. Salicylate no longer produced echinocytes when the chloride concentration was reduced. Cells exposed to salicylate in 60 mM chloride were less cupped than the control cells. We suggest that the distribution of the charged form of the drug across the membrane is in equilibrium with the distribution of chloride ions. Changes in the intracellular drug concentration when the extracellular chloride is varied could then account for the observed shape changes in a manner which is consistent with the bilayer couple hypothesis for drug-membrane interactions. Cell glycocalyx charge depletion did not affect the shape induced by either the cationic or anionic drugs. The result suggests that any sialic acid dependent electric potential at the bilayer surface is small compared to the cell's zeta potential.", "PMC2872012": "Rat serum and liver ICDH, OCT, GOT and GPT activities are significantly elevated 2-6 hr after i.p. injections of single doses (2.5 mg/kg body wt) of dichlorvos. ICDH, OCT, GOT and GPT activities are significantly increased in serum and liver of rats receiving daily injections (0.25 mg/kg body wt) for 7 days. Although liver SD is significantly elevated in the single and repeated dosage study, serum SD appears unaffected at these levels of dichlorvos toxicity. Changes in serum OCT activity estimations maybe a useful single parameter for screening pesticides for potential hepatotoxic effects in humans and farm animals.", "PMC3338507": "The prevalence of resistance to six commonly-used antimicrobial agents in faecal coliforms from children in Khartoum, Sudan was studied. A relatively high prevalence of resistance was found, ranging from 96% of children with isolates resistant to ampicillin to 70% of children with isolates resistant to chloramphenicol. Seventy-seven percent of children had isolates with high-level resistance to trimethoprim (MIC greater than 1000 micrograms/ml). Twenty-nine different resistance patterns were found. Thirty-nine percent of the children had isolates resistant to all six antibiotics studied, and 80% of children had isolates resistant to at least four. Transfer of resistance to each of the antimicrobials, in varying combinations, was demonstrated, but did not occur for all resistance patterns. Plasmid analysis showed plasmids ranging from 160 MDa to 2.8 MDa and isolates contained from one to five plasmids of different sizes. There were no consistent relationships between resistance pattern and plasmid profile, but multiple resistance transfer was mediated commonly by plasmids with a molecular weight of 62 MDa. The high prevalence of potentially transferable antibiotic resistance in gut commensals of children in the Sudan may be of importance in the management of enteric and other infections requiring antimicrobial treatment.", "PMC2211956": "Human anti-HIV antibody-coated magnetic beads and magnetic particle concentrators were used to eliminate HIV antigens and the infected cells in vitro. Fifty micrograms/ml of the antibody coated on 30 mg/ml of tosyl-activated beads, and 10 min of reaction time between the antigens and the immunobeads were sufficient to eliminate the virus antigens from phosphate buffered saline, serum and peripheral blood. HIV-infected cells were eliminated in vitro, but not completely. This method will be useful in eliminating viral antigens and infected cells from clinical material such as blood and blood products.", "PMC3391688": "Reduced lymphocyte histamine-binding after in vitro exposure of whole blood samples to bee venom appears related to allergen reactivity. The reactivity demonstrated using this method matched the clinical findings and was used to monitor declining responses to allergen during desensitization therapy for hypersensitivity to bee venom. After successful desensitization to bee venom, patients' lymphocytes did not show decreased histamine binding following in vitro exposure to venom. We conclude that lymphocyte histamine-binding sites are down-regulated by allergen-mediated histamine release in hypersensitive subjects, and that this response diminishes with immunotherapy. This report describes a novel method for the in vitro assessment of reactivity to bee venom.", "PMC3843715": "The shortening reflex was elicited in food-sated Hirudo medicinalis by light flashes delivered at 20-s intervals over a 40-trial session. The reflex was enhanced if animals were stored at 5-7 degrees C rather than 20 degrees C. Short-term, that is, within-sessions, habituation was readily observed. Dishabituation could be produced by a single electric shock at Trial 30. However, the shock also enhanced responding when delivered before Trial 1 (sensitization). No long-term, that is, between-sessions, habituation occurred over 6 consecutive days of testing; on the contrary, responding gradually increased.", "PMC3971957": "Extracts of amniocentesis samples from 144 women were tested for the presence of mutagenic substances using tester strain TA1538 in the Ames Salmonella/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test. Because the volume of amniotic fluid in these samples was limited (generally less than 10 ml), we investigated modifications of this mutagenesis assay that could increase its ability to detect effects from small quantities of test material. Using mutagenicity in samples of urine from smokers as a model, it appeared that improved ability to detect small amounts of mutagen could be obtained by reducing volumes of media and reagents while keeping the amount of test sample constant. This modification resulted in a test procedure capable of readily detecting mutagenicity in volumes of urine from smokers that were smaller than the volumes of amniotic fluid available. Tests of amniotic fluid extracts by this modified procedure showed small increases in revertants, about 50% above dimethylsulfoxide solvent control values. Results of procedures to control for technical factors possibly contributing to these increases suggested that the increased values could not be readily explained by contamination of test samples with mutagens during the extraction procedure. They also were not explained by alterations in spontaneous numbers of revertants associated with changes in the density of bacterial lawn growth. The increases suggest the presence of small amounts of mutagenic material in many of the amniotic fluid samples. At the doses employed, mutagenic activity in these samples was not associated with maternal smoking.", "PMC387265": "A description is presented of improved methods of examining the conductive system of the heart designed for special routine investigations.

The cardiac arrhythmias were produced by intravenous (i.v.) infusion of ouabain (1 microgram/kg/min). The PGs E2, F2 alpha and I2 on i.c.v. administration in the dose range of 1 ng to 10 micrograms failed to inhibit ouabain-induced cardiac arrhythmias. However, when infused i.v., PGE2 (1 microgram/kg/min), PGF2 alpha (5 micrograms/kg/min), and PGI2 (2 micrograms/kg/min) effectively suppressed these arrhythmias. The standard antiarrhythmic drug propranolol (0.5-8.0 mg) on i.c.v. administration also significantly reduced the ouabain-induced cardiac arrhythmias. It is suggested that the CNS is not the site of action of PGs E2, F2 alpha, and I2 in antagonising the ouabain-induced cardiotoxicity in cats.", "PMC2831300": "The effects of short- and long-chain fatty acids on the cerebromicrovascular (Na+ + K+)-ATPase were investigated using specific [3H]ouabain binding to the enzyme. Specific binding increased linearly with total microvessel protein (37-110 micrograms) and was time-dependent with maximum binding obtained by 10 min. Arachidonic acid, but not palmitic acid, stimulated [3H]ouabain binding in a dose-dependent manner, with a 105% increase over basal levels at 100 microM arachidonic acid. Preincubation of the microvessels with arachidonic acid did not alter the stimulation observed. 4-Pentenoic acid stimulated [3H]ouabain binding only at high concentrations (10 mM). Scatchard analysis of [3H]ouabain binding to untreated microvessels yielded a single class of \"high-affinity\" binding sites with an apparent binding affinity (KD) of 64.7 +/- 2.0 nM and a binding capacity (Bmax) of 10.1 +/- 1.5 pmol/mg protein. In the presence of 100 microM arachidonic acid, a monophasic Scatchard plot also was obtained, but the KD significantly decreased to 51.9 +/- 2.7 nM (p less than 0.01), whereas the Bmax remained virtually unchanged (12.5 +/- 1.2 pmol/mg protein). The stimulation of [3H]ouabain binding in the presence of arachidonic acid was potentiated by 4-pentenoic acid, but not by indomethacin or eicosatetraynoic acid. These data suggest that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may be involved in the regulation of blood-brain barrier (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and may play a role in the cerebral dysfunction associated with diseases in which plasma levels of nonesterified fatty acids are elevated.", "PMC2224530": "The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) was stimulated electrically while single-cell activity was recorded in the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) of rats under pentobarbital anesthesia.

Off-cells (92%) were found to be inhibited by IPN stimulation, whereas on-cells (50%) were excited.

Based on our previous work, where we demonstrated in rats pretreated with pertussis toxin the blockade of negative chronotropic and reduction of negative inotropic effects of carbamoylcholine, we examined the effects of cholinergic agents on the rat heart adenylate cyclase activity. Pertussis toxin pretreatment reduced the inhibitory effects of cholinergic agents on adenylate cyclase activity only very slightly. This contrasts to the strong antagonistic effect on the phenylisopropyladenosine-induced inhibition of adrenergic lipolysis, including that increased lipolysis after 48 hours starvation. These data suggest that the strong inhibition of negative chronotropic effect of muscarinic drugs by pertussis toxin may be related to the recently described No protein rather then Ni protein from the adenylate cyclase complex.", "PMC4038811": "The transmission of a malignant catarrhal fever-like syndrome to sheep is reported. Fetal sheep between 40 and 66 days gestation were inoculated intravenously with viable cells either from a red deer with clinical malignant catarrhal fever or from rabbits with the disease. Of the 21 fetuses in the experiment only five were born live and of these four developed clinical signs similar to malignant catarrhal fever in other species and died or were killed 10, 16, 47 and 175 days after birth. The fifth lamb remained unaffected. Histology of the four affected lambs revealed a generalised lymphoproliferation, with T-dependent areas of lymphoid tissues being affected, and an overall paucity of immunoglobulin containing cells. In addition arteritis and interstitial infiltration of many organs by lymphoid cells was present. The infectious agent was not reisolated in rabbits from lambs or passed to red deer housed in the same pen and it is thus considered possible that gene expression of the putative virus was incomplete.", "PMC2151488": "Pharmacokinetic profiles in small animals substantially differ from those observed in man. We hence devised a man adapted animal model to critically assess the impact of such differences on antimicrobial efficacy. We approximated in mice the human pharmacokinetic profiles of netilmicin, ticarcillin and ceftazidime. The CD50 (curative dose for 50% of lethally intra-peritoneally infected animals) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparatively determined for murine versus man-adapted pharmacokinetic profiles. With netilmicin the man-adapted profile was significantly less efficacious than the murine profile. In contrast, a significant superiority of the man-adapted profile was found with the beta-lactam drugs. We conclude that determinations of antimicrobial activity in small animals may yield misleading results in respect to man. Depending on the drug in question, murine pharmacokinetics may lead to overestimation or underestimation of antimicrobial activity. Our findings are of particular importance for the interpretation of studies in small animals comparing different antimicrobial compounds or different dosage regimens.", "PMC2033894": "The relationship between smoking and ischemic heart disease was discussed, in terms of the smoking habit and the mechanisms of acute and chronic effects of smoking on the cardiovascular system as one of the coronary risk factors, with reference to exercise capacity and coronary flow reserve. The smoking habits of 1000 consecutive patients with ischemic heart disease, who were evaluated with coronary angiography, were analyzed. High percentages of smokers were observed in the younger generation. It was up to 86% in the 4th decade, though it was only 48% in the 8th decade. There was no large difference in other risk factors between smokers and non-smokers. The exercise capacity with and without smoking was evaluated with treadmill exercise test in 6 healthy volunteers. The exercise time was decreased with smoking, compared to without smoking, indicating a decrease in exercise capacity due to smoking. The elevated concentration of carbon monoxide in blood decreased the ability of oxygen transport. The increased lactic acid level in blood with smoking suggested anaerobic energy production acting as a part of the energy source. The smoking increased the myocardial oxygen consumption in relation to increase in heart rate and blood pressure. It decreased coronary flow reserve, shown by a peak to resting flow velocity ratio measured with the Doppler flow velocimeter. In coronary heart disease, therefore, the threshold of myocardial ischemia was decreased by smoking. The decrease in coronary flow reserve recovered with cessation of smoking for more than 2 days.", "PMC3055213": "Secretory IgA (SIgA), which is one of the humoral factors responsible for the immune protection of large areas of mucosal surfaces, is produced by plasma cells resident in the submucosae and glandular stroma. However, specific induction of SIgA antibodies occurs largely through the common mucosal immune system, whereby antigens presented to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as intestinal Peyer's patches, stimulate B lymphocytes committed to IgA synthesis. These cells enter the circulation via lymphatics and finally home to several remote secretory tissues. The regulatory cells and factors that govern the mucosal immune response are beginning to be elucidated. Several bacterial and viral antigens have been used to evoke SIgA antibodies experimentally in humans, but only a few oral vaccines have been developed for clinical application. Considerable scope exists for the identification of appropriate immunogens and their formulation in delivery vehicles with suitable adjuvants to induce protective antibodies against a variety of pathogens that invade through mucosal surfaces. Several mucosal pathogens, however, secrete proteases that specifically cleave human IgA1. The full significance of this evasion mechanism and the ways of circumventing it must be addressed to maximize the effectiveness of mucosal immunity.", "PMC2448600": "Ca-dependent, K-stimulated 86Rb efflux, a measure of Ca-activated K conductance in rat brain synaptosomes, was blocked by phenothiazines and haloperidol. Micromolar concentrations of the phenothiazines, fluphenazine and trifluoperazine, and haloperidol, a non-phenothiazine antipsychotic and calmodulin antagonist, selectively inhibited the Ca-activated K channels. The IC50 values of all three agents for inhibition of the Ca-activated K channels was on the order of 0.5-1 microM. Measurements of K-stimulated 45Ca uptake indicated that the effects of these agents on Ca-activated K channels was not due to inhibition of Ca influx through voltage-gated Ca channels. Sulpiride, a potent antipsychotic with weak anti-calmodulin activity, was a relatively weak inhibitor of Ca-activated K channels. Calmidazolium (compound R-24571) and W7, two non-phenothiazine calmodulin antagonists, did not selectively inhibit Ca-activated K channels. Biphasic dose response curves for inhibition of the Ca-dependent, K-stimulated 86Rb efflux by the phenothiazines raise the possibility that there may be two kinds of Ca-activated K channels in rat brain presynaptic terminals, with different sensitivities to the phenothiazines. These results demonstrate that two phenothiazines and haloperidol are potent and relatively selective inhibitors of Ca-activated K channels in nerve endings. This inhibition does not appear to be mediated by calmodulin or by dopamine receptors.", "PMC2795155": "Aplysia can readily exhibit operant conditioning of their head-waving response when bright light is used as aversive reinforcement (Cook and Carew, 1986). In the first paper of this series (Cook and Carew, 1989a), we showed that the electromyographic (EMG) activity of a discrete band of neck muscles, the lateral columellar muscles (LCMs) of Aplysia is significantly correlated with the component of head-waving (the horizontal component) that is modified during operant conditioning. In the present paper, we asked whether the EMG activity of the LCMs themselves could also be contingently modified, using the same procedures that produce operant conditioning of the behavioral response. Differential EMG from the LCMs was recorded in freely behaving animals with chronically implanted muscle cuff electrodes. Animals receiving aversive reinforcement (bright light) that was contingent upon specific patterns of LCM activity readily learned to alter their differential EMG output. Like operant conditioning of the head-waving response, this operant modification of LCM activity was rapidly acquired and was specific to the contingencies of reinforcement. These results show that a restricted group of muscles, the LCMs, exhibit the essential features of the head-waving system observed at the behavioral level: (1) their activity is significantly correlated with head-waving behavior, and (2) the LCMs are capable of operant modification of their output. Thus, this restricted response system provides a useful preparation for examining the neural mechanisms of operant conditioning of head-waving in Aplysia.", "PMC3055214": "The complement system mediates numerous host defense reactions. These include the production of an acute inflammatory response, which aids in the localization and destruction of an infectious agent; the elimination of pathogens by opsonization and phagocytosis or by extracellular killing; and immunoregulation, which enhances the generation of specific immune responses. These actions and their mechanisms are considered here.", "PMC2136981": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether normal, nonhypertensive subjects who have unusually large increases of systolic blood pressure with exercise have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). DESIGN: Case-comparison using echocardiography as a criterion standard for measurement of left ventricular mass and the diagnosis of LVH. SETTING: Population-based health fitness screening program and referral Veterans Affairs Hospital. SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine men (average age, 44.6 +/- 8.5 years; range, 34 to 71 years) were studied, including 25 participants in a health fitness screening program and an additional 14 normal men with atypical chest pain. Twenty-two subjects with a systolic blood pressure during peak exercise of 210 mm Hg or greater were compared with 17 others with systolic pressure less than 210 mm Hg during exercise. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index greater than 134 g/m2) was found in 14 of 22 men with a systolic blood pressure of 210 mm Hg or greater (present in 6.3% of normotensive healthy male volunteers in a health screening program) but in only 1 person with a lower exercise blood pressure. Left ventricular mass index was linearly correlated (r = 0.65, n = 39, P less than 0.001) with maximum exercise blood pressure. Whereas LVH was mild in about 50%, substantial LVH was present in the others. The presence of LVH was not related to superior physical conditioning and was accompanied by increased left atrial size suggesting impaired left ventricular filling. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of hypertension, exaggerated blood pressure responses during exercise testing suggest a probability of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.83) of LVH, a finding associated with the cardiac \"end-organ\" manifestations of hypertension.", "PMC1971487": "The benzodiazepines were first introduced in 1960. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) was the first of the class of drugs called benzodiazepines, in a deliberate attempt to synthesize a tranquilizer without the sedative properties and abuse, addiction, tolerance, and dependence potential of the barbiturates, and other sedative/hypnotic drugs. The popularity of the benzodiazepines rose steadily to a peak period in the mid 1970s when diazepam (Valium) was the most commonly prescribed drug of any kind, including antihypertensive, analgesic and other psychotropic medications. The current evaluations of benzodiazepines use and abuse demonstrate clearly that they produce tolerance and dependence in short and long-term administration. The development of abuse and addiction is also strongly substantiated although they are not as easily appreciated and identified because of confusion in diagnosis and treatment of abuse and addiction. Significant problems in definitions, diagnosis, interpretations and conclusions exist in general practice regarding abuse and addiction, and their relationship to use of and symptoms produced by benzodiazepines. The lack of clarity in defining abuse and addiction and tolerance and dependence in clinical practice leads to institution and perpetuation of the toxicity and untoward effects of the benzodiazepines.", "PMC2912912": "Cumulative light-mediated damage to the retina over a long time period may be involved in the development of age-related retinopathies. Light is thought to produce retinal damage by initiating autoxidative reactions among the molecular components of the retina. Experiments were therefore conducted (1) to confirm that long-term differences in cyclic light intensity affect the rate of age-related photoreceptor cell loss from the retina; and (2) to determine whether the antioxidant, vitamin E, is an effective inhibitor of damage to the retina by bright cyclic light. Albino rats were fed a basal diet either supplemented with or deficient in vitamin E. Each dietary group was divided into two light-treatment groups which were exposed to 12 hr cyclic light of either 15 lux or 750 lux. After 10 and 17 weeks of treatment, retinal photoreceptor cell densities were determined for animals in each group. Vitamin E deficiency resulted in moderate decreases in photoreceptor cell densities in the dim-light groups after both 10 and 17 weeks. Rats exposed to the bright-light condition suffered a pronounced loss of photoreceptor cells by 10 weeks, and an even greater cell loss by 17 weeks. Vitamin E deficiency did not enhance the effect of bright cyclic light in reducing photoreceptor cell densities. Thus, it appears unlikely that retinal damage by cyclic light occurs via an autoxidative mechanism.", "PMC4055261": "The authors review the extensive literature on the asthmatic effects of Paf-acether (PAF), suggesting that anti-asthmatic drugs may owe their therapeutic efficacy to their inhibition of PAF-induced pathology.", "PMC4065165": "After lumbar puncture (LP) an epidural CSF leakage caused by delayed closure of a dural defect leads to a decrease in CSF pressure. The resultant venous dilatation as well as downward shift of the brain with traction on pain-sensitive blood vessels and nerves frequently evokes post-lumbar puncture headache (PLPH), when the patient assumes the upright position. In previous studies differing opinions have been expressed about the prophylactic value of the posture taken by the patient after LP. The present study was designed to evaluate the benefit of the decrease of hydrostatic CSF pressure on the dural rent, when the patient lies down in a prone position with the head tilted down at an angle of 10 degrees for 30 min immediately after LP: is it possible to accelerate the closure of the dural defect in this way and prevent PLPH? One group of patients (n = 78) lay in a prone position with the head tilted down at an angle of 10 degrees for 30 min, the other group (n = 82) rose immediately after LP. PLPH was found to be independent of the posture in both groups and affected 44% and 41% of the patients, respectively, so that there is no longer any justification for requiring patients to remain in bed after LP.", "PMC3631771": "The thalidomide catastrophy in the early 1960th clearly demonstrated the need of accurate epidemiological data of birth defects. Since 1963 there is in Sweden like in many other countries a continuous registration of congenital malformations in order to provide data for the early detection of changes in frequencies or patterns of defects and thus also to facilitate early identification of new environmental teratogens. During the more than 20 years period the Swedish register has been in operation an increase in the incidence of certain malformations such as omphalocele, hypospadia and Down's syndrome in the offspring of young mothers has been observed. Despite rather extensive studies no explanation for these changes has so far been found. Due to the great concern in the public about the relation between environmental factors and the occurrence of congenital malformations it is of great importance that the register can be used to elucidate the situation when there has been a suspicion of increased teratogenic risks in certain areas of Sweden or when pregnant women have special working conditions. The rate of malformations has been found to be higher among infants born to women coded as laboratory technicians than in the rest of the Swedish population. So far, no specific teratogenic factor has been identified. In Sweden no relation has been found between the incidence of congenital malformations and socioeconomic conditions.

Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by using the macrodilution test and activity was compared with nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime and gentamicin for gram-negative rods, norfloxacin and gentamicin for Staphylococcus strains, and norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin and gentamicin for enterococci.

Human cells infected with viruses were able to induce high levels of interferon upon contact with human lymphocytes. Interferon, whether produced by lymphocytes after direct infection with virus or induced upon exposure of lymphocytes to virus-infected fibroblasts, appeared to be responsible for enhancing the cytotoxic efficiency of the natural killer cell against the infected target. Activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes occurred as early as 6 hr after addition of interferon and increased up to 24 hr. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Ab-CMC) could be easily induced by sensitization of infected target cells with antiviral antibodies and could be detected at 4 hr from the beginning of the cytotoxic test, before the effect of interferon on the natural killer cell was evident. However, the antibody-dependent effector cell was inactive after 4 hr of incubation. F(ab')2 fragments of rabbit anti-human IgG completely inhibited Ab-CMC but did not at all affect the spontaneous cytotoxic activity of the effector cells against virus-infected target.", "PMC1626103": "Both male and female workers may be exposed to occupational agents which affect their reproductive processes. Reproductive outcomes are important in their own right, for example teratogenic effects and impaired neurological development. In addition, reproductive impairment may indicate germ cell mutation, which has far-reaching implications. Research into reproductive effects is beset with pitfalls. Applying the results of toxicological research may be suggestive, but such extrapolation is very unreliable owing to profound differences in reproductive and/or toxicological mechanisms. Epidemiological data are therefore indispensable. Optimal methods of data collection and study design, comparable with similar studies of other populations, are essential. Otherwise reliable conclusions cannot be drawn, and this is a waste of resources and of the work and cooperation of everyone who participates in the research. In considering study design, the key question is the measurement (or minimally, the accurate description) of exposures, which is more problematic than the ascertainment of reproductive outcome variables. From the viewpoint of exposures, case control studies have the same disadvantage as studies of the general population, that exposures are heterogeneous, and most specific exposures are therefore rare, even in a large study; in addition, measurement is particularly difficult in this situation. Occupationally defined populations have the corresponding advantages of relative homogeneity and availability of data, although even here numerous problems exist, which are well known. Outcomes can be assessed by means of biological or questionnaire-based methods.

Ninety-eight patients had failed chronic immunosuppressive therapy and three patients had acute intracranial bleeding or total absence of platelets in the peripheral blood smear, and had urgent splenectomy. At primary splenectomy, accessory spleens were identified and resected in 18% of patients. There was no operative mortality. Fifty-eight patients had an excellent response to splenectomy and their steroids were tapered off within 3 weeks. Thirteen patients had a poor response to primary splenectomy of whom eight remitted spontaneously and five required accessory splenectomy resulting in complete remission in three patients. Twenty-nine patients were considered nonresponders, 25 of whom had radionuclide scanning for accessory spleens. Seven of these patients had accessory spleens identified but only four consented to accessory splenectomy. In three of the four patients, a complete remission was achieved. Neither platelet antibody titers nor measurements of platelet survival or turnover predicted platelet response to splenectomy. However, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in older patients was significantly less likely to respond to splenectomy.

The drug was injected in 1 minute (bolus) in 11 patients (Group A). The other 11 patients (Group B) received the drug by slow intravenous infusion (20 minutes). Electrophysiological parameters were measured before and after erythromycin. A significant prolongation of the atrial refractory periods (+39 ms), ventricular refractory periods (+20 ms), QT (+20 ms) and QTC intervals (+42 ms) was observed in Group A. These electrophysiological effects could explain an arrhythmogenic action similar to that of antiarrhythmic drugs in Group I of Vaughan-Williams' classification.

Left ventricular and aortic pressures, dP/dtmax, and stroke volume were measured. Additionally, isovolumic peak pressure and peak dP/dtmax were measured during short occlusions of the aorta for assessing myocardial performance independent of circulatory changes. In rats inosine caused a dose dependent decrease in dP/dtmax (-5%, -21%, -40% of preinfusion values), heart rate (-7%, -23%, -55%), and mean aortic pressure. Additionally, a subgroup of seven rats was paced at their initial preinfusion heart rate, but independently from the heart rate there was a reduction in dP/dtmax (-15%). The isovolumic measurements confirmed the negative inotropic effect of inosine in rats. Peak dP/dtmax was reduced to 85% of preinfusion values with a dose of 2.5 mg.kg-1 min-1 (to 70% of preinfusion values with 10 mg.kg-1.min-1).

Passive immunization of rats with specific antibodies to the 14 and 28 amino acid sequences caused a significant GH elevation. The fact that somatostatin antiserum was unable to block episodic GH surges indicates that this hormone's release must be regulated by a dual mechanism. Indeed, GH-releasing factor (GRF) seems to be instrumental in the maintenance of pulsatile GH secretion. Moreover, exogenous GRF induced a further GH increase predominantly during the period of active secretion. Neutralization of endogenous somatostatin eliminated this time-dependent effect, indicating that this peptide blocks periodical spontaneous GH release. Food deprivation and changes in glucose homeostasis virtually obliterate the ultradian GH rhythm. In this context, peripheral somatostatin seems to play an important role.

These channels, which may play a role in cerebral autoregulation, also appear resistant to antagonism by the benzothiazepine calcium antagonist diltiazem, an agent known to block potential-sensitive and receptor-operated calcium channels. If cerebral autoregulation involves stretch-sensitive diltiazem-resistant calcium channels, then autoregulation should remain intact during vasodilatation produced by diltiazem. The present study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Using a canine cerebral venous outflow preparation, experiments were first performed to determine the optimum dose and route of administration for diltiazem. Although continuous i.v. diltiazem (1-100 micrograms/kg/min) did not increase cerebral perfusion at any normotensive dose, i.a. (lingual artery) diltiazem at 10.0 micrograms/kg/min increased cerebral blood flow by 36% and decreased cerebrovascular resistance by 31% without significant effects on blood gas levels, cerebral oxygen uptake, cardiac output or mean arterial pressure. In autoregulation experiments, 10.0 micrograms/kg/min of diltiazem significantly attenuated but did not eliminate autoregulatory responses to increases (inflation of an aortic balloon) and decreases (hemorrhage) in cerebral perfusion pressure. Autoregulatory responses to increases and decreases in perfusion pressure were equally affected by diltiazem, but both were unaffected by i.a. saline. These data support the view that cerebral autoregulation involves both diltiazem-sensitive and diltiazem-resistant mechanisms.

DESIGN: Exploratory study in which active treatment was preceded by placebo. SETTING: Inpatient unit of teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Nine men with uncomplicated essential hypertension who had a normal sodium intake. INTERVENTIONS: Two single intravenous doses of RO 42-5892 (100 and 1,000 micrograms/kg in 10 minutes) given to six patients and one single oral dose (600 mg) given to the three others as well as to three of the patients who also received the two intravenous doses. RESULTS: With both intravenous and oral doses renin activity fell in 10 minutes to undetectably low values, while angiotensin II concentration fell overall by 80-90% with intravenous dosing and by 30-40% after the oral dose. Angiotensin II concentration was back to baseline four hours after the low and six hours after the high intravenous dose and remained low for at least eight hours after the oral dose. Blood pressure fell rapidly both after low and high intravenous doses and after the oral dose and remained low for hours. With the high intravenous dose the daytime (0900-2230), night time (2300-0600), and next morning (0630-0830) systolic blood pressures were significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered by 12.5 (95% confidence interval 5.6 to 19.7), 12.2 (5.4 to 19.3), and 10.7 (3.2 to 18.5) mm Hg respectively, and daytime diastolic pressure was lowered by 9.3 (2.2 to 16.8) mmHg. With the oral dose daytime, night time, and next morning systolic blood pressures were lowered by 10.3 (5.5 to 15.4), 10.5 (4.2 to 17.2), and 9.7 (4.0 to 15.6) mm Hg, and daytime and night time diastolic pressures were lowered by 5.8 (0.9 to 11.0) and 6.0 (0.3-12) mm Hg respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the inhibitor on blood pressure was maintained over a longer period than its effect on angiotensin II.

Extracellular taurine levels increased during perfusions of agonists, listed in descending order of potency: kainate (KA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and quisqualate (QA). While taurine increases due to KA or QA perfusions were inhibited by 6,7-dinitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), those induced by NMDA were abolished in the presence of 3-(carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP). These results indicate that increases in extracellular taurine levels evoked by NMDA, KA or QA in the rat hippocampus are caused by activation of their specific receptors. Field potentials, concomitantly recorded, were quickly abolished during NMDA or KA perfusions (0.1 mM), while QA (0.25 mM) induced the appearance of bicuculline-like evoked responses. Since taurine has been proposed as an osmoregulatory substance in the rat brain, and cell swelling is known to be an early component of glutamate agonists neurotoxicity, the increases in extracellular taurine reported here could be due to taurine released through an osmoregulatory process, counteracting the neurotoxic cellular oedema induced by glutamate agonists.", "PMC2913140": "Two-hundred forty-six patients with undiagnosed headache, after unrewarding neurologic evaluation, were referred to an allergy clinic and were evaluated both by routine sinus radiographs and flexible fiberoptic rhinoscopy.

Mitotic figures were extremely rare in treated tumors, suggesting that the tumor cells have lost their ability to cycle.", "PMC3344527": "The time-course of haemolysis induced by alkyltrimethylammonium bromides, alkyl sulphates, octaethyleneglycol alkyl ethers, and ZWITTERGENT detergents (C10-C16) was studied. A considerable lag in the development of haemolysis was observed for the C10 and C12 derivatives. The lag exceeded 30 min at low or moderate concentrations of the surfactants. Most of the C14 and C16 derivatives showed no lag but the time-course of the haemolytic reaction of these derivatives indicated biphasic kinetics of haemolysis. With those surfactants showing a lag the critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the surfactants was above the concentrations used in the experiments, whereas cmc in the case of those surfactants showing no lag was close to or slightly below. It is concluded that the differences in the time-course of the haemolytic reaction shown by different derivatives are not connected with the occurrence of micelles in the bulk solution, but that the differences in time-course of the haemolytic reaction reflect differences in the rate of those changes in the membrane molecular organization which precede haemolysis.", "PMC2365674": "This paper presents important considerations regarding the implementation and maintenance of the newly developed HeSCA Code of Ethics. The author examines four roles (ideological, educational, regulative, and judicial) that the code can serve within HeSCA. A four-phase framework whereby the code might be gradually institutionalized is presented, along with functions that the HeSCA Ethics Committee might assume to help integrate the code and its principles into the professional activities of all HeSCA members.", "PMC3654277": "In this study the amount of neutral and acidic glycosaminoglycans in the zona pellucida and antrum of primary, preovulatory, and atretic follicles was analyzed. Serial sections of preovulatory hamster follicles were stained with PAS or alcian blue to estimate the content of neutral and acidic glycosaminoglycans, respectively. The amount of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and sialic acid was determined using enzyme digestion procedures followed by alcian blue staining. Microdensitometric analyses showed that the strongest PAS staining was in the zona pellucida of atretic follicles, less staining in preovulatory follicles but more than in the antrum of preovulatory follicles. No hyaluronic acid was found in the zona pellucida of any follicular type, but there was a measurable amount in the antrum of preovulatory follicles. Chondroitin sulfate was present in the zona pellucida of primary and atretic follicles, as well as in the antrum of preovulatory follicles. Sialic acid was present in the antrum and zona pellucida of all follicular types. Sialic acid plays a role in receptor recognition and its presence may reflect the role of the zona pellucida in sperm recognition and fertilization.", "PMC3893250": "Locally administered low-dose streptokinase was used in 13 patients with acute arterial occlusions. Systemic fibrinolytic effects were noted in each of 11 patients in whom some effective thrombolysis was demonstrated. In the two patients with no angiographically demonstrable thrombolysis, a systemic lytic effect was absent. Bleeding complications were frequent (31%). Three patients required amputations and one patient died. The systemic lytic effects of streptokinase appear to be necessary for complete clot lysis. Locally administered streptokinase appears to have no significant benefit compared to high-dose systemic administration. Occlusions accessible to balloon embolectomy should probably be treated surgically, reserving fibrinolytic therapy for inaccessible lesions. More research is needed to clarify the specific indications, as well as to determine optimal methods of administration and dosage.", "PMC2106397": "Dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (DPPA) was found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on Fe-induced peroxidation of arachidonic acid inserted into liposomal dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles. This inhibition was quite effective both below and above the phase transition temperature of the liposomes. Moreover, we demonstrated the antiperoxidative activity of phosphatidic acid (PA) in synaptosomal membranes. PA enriched synaptosomes were prepared by the stimulation of the endogenous phospholipase D activity or by the incubation of the synaptosomes with Streptomyces chromofuscus phospholipase D. The possible contribution of PA to the in vivo defense mechanism against free radical-induced damage is discussed.", "PMC3168757": "At concentrations ranging from 8.5 to 30 microM, octylonium bromide (OB) did not affect sodium channel availability measured as maximal rate of depolarization (Vmax) of cardiac action potential. On the other hand, at equieffective spasmolytic concentrations (1.1 mM), procaine markedly inhibited Vmax as well as other electrophysiological parameters. These experiments indicate that at fully effective spasmolytic concentrations OB is devoid of local anaesthetic properties. In concentrations up to 10 microM OB did not affect phosphodiesterase activity in crude homogenates of rat colon which were inhibited by both papaverine (EC50 = 0.7 mM) and theophylline (EC50 = 3.5 mM). OB was more effective in antagonizing spasmogen-induced contractions on colonic as compared to tracheal preparations. Inhibition of Neurohormone-induced calcium ion mobilization from cellular and extracellular pools remains the mechanism of action which best explains the spasmolytic effects of OB on intestinal smooth muscle.", "PMC1913541": "The authors evaluated the combination of etoposide/cyclophosphamide (VP/CY) as initial, presurgical therapy for patients with osteosarcoma and found an 88% response rate for the primary tumor and any metastases. After definitive, limb-salvage surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with etoposide, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, patients without metastases at diagnosis whose cases were followed for a median of 2 years from diagnosis achieved a relapse-free survival (RFS) probability of 78% +/- 9%. This result is equivalent to the best adjuvant chemotherapy results reported to date. Patients without metastases at diagnosis had significantly better RFS probability (78% +/- 9%) than those with metastases at diagnosis (0%). Transient, severe myelosuppression has been the only major toxicity of the VP/CY courses. No irreversible organ damage or toxic deaths have been seen in patients enrolled in this study. The authors conclude that the combination of VP/CY is effective treatment for osteosarcoma, and when combined with cisplatin/doxorubicin (CIS/DOX), is as effective as any previously reported chemotherapy for osteosarcoma.", "PMC3149062": "Diverticular disease of the female urethra is rare, but not so rare as assumed hitherto. The predominant theory is that diverticula urethrae is secondary to infection of the glandulae paraurethrales, but they can be easily pared out, and this together with their three-dimensional appearance with subdivision in side, undermines this theory. On the other hand, the known fact that urethral diverticula can be observed in female babies and girls of school age and also in urethral moulds of healthy young women, in which widened urethral glands can be found, supports the idea of a congenital origin. The irritability of the female urethra results from the fact that it is made up of two germ layers. Inflammation of paraurethral ducts causes secondary widening of small congenital diverticula of the female urethra. Proximally located diverticula can irritate sphincter function, as does invasive treatment. In some cases endoscopic therapy might be justified rather than plastic surgical removal via the vagina. The history, symptoms, diagnostis, histology and secondary pathology are indicated only very briefly.", "PMC2107303": "Concentrations of immunoreactive follicle regulatory protein (FRP) were determined in 184 follicular fluid samples recovered from 30 patients in whom ovarian stimulation before oocyte recovery and in-vitro fertilization was induced with FSH (150 i.u./day). Ovum recovery was scheduled when the diameters of greater than or equal to 2 follicles reached 15-17 mm and serum oestradiol values were 740 pM/follicle. The mean level of FRP in fluid from follicles yielding oocytes which fertilized and cleaved within 48 h of recovery (24.4 +/- 3.08 immunoreactive units [IRU]/ml; 1 IRU = approximately 1 ng pig FRP) was higher than that in fluid from follicles yielding oocytes which did not fertilize (10.5 +/- 1.67 IRU/ml, P less than 0.05). FRP in fluid from follicles yielding oocytes which fertilized but did not cleave within 48 h of recovery was 17.2 +/- 2.89 IRU/ml. Overall, concentrations of FRP did not correlate with follicular fluid volume or with FSH or LH concentrations, but were positively related to prolactin, oestradiol and total protein levels (P less than 0.04). The results indicate that the FRP content of follicular fluid may be predictive of follicle/oocyte maturity. A dose-dependent increase in release of FRP by pig granulosa cells cultured in medium supplemented with 10-100 ng prolactin/ml was demonstrated. Prolactin may, therefore, be an important determinant of FRP production by granulosa cells.", "PMC3527394": "Using the Analytab (API 20E) Enterobacteriaceae system of biochemical identification, a total of 506 Escherichia coli isolates from different animal species were coded numerically or biotyped. Fifty-four different biotypes were identified, 11 accounting for 83.1% of the isolates examined. Three of these profiles accounted for 65.3% of the isolates and were found in almost all animal species. Some of the biotypes were found in only one animal species: six in cattle, five in horses, 15 in pigs, two in sheep, two in birds, one in dogs and one in a porpoise. Biotypes, as determined here, could not be related to a particular pathology and more work is needed to assess the extent and significance of this relative biotype specificity among animal species. The use of other, more sophisticated, typing systems, i.e. plasmid \"fingerprinting\", or restriction endonuclease analysis of chromosomal DNA, would have to be investigated.", "PMC3040768": "Our study examined 166 patients with breast cancer with a mean age of 63 years. Each patient underwent mastectomy with the organ being investigated by histological giant sections and additional small sections from the nipple. Nipple involvement was found in 64 cases (38%). Multifocal carcinoma occurred in 76 patients. Further multicentric carcinomatous foci (36 cases) demonstrated a significant increase in affected nipples. Additional atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia was observed in 53 cases and showed involvement in 34. Nine carcinomas of ductal origin were combined with lobular carcinoma in situ, all cases proved to have carcinomatous changes in the nipple. It is concluded that apart from the well-known influence of advanced tumor stages and tumor localization, nipple involvement correlates with multicentricity and multifocality of breast cancer as a disease of the whole organ.", "PMC2656512": "Minor transplantation, or histocompatibility (H), antigens are the targets of host-versus-graft (hvg) and graft-versus-host (gvh) reactions that occur when organs or tissues are exchanged between members of the same species who, although genetically not identical, are matched for their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encoded transplantation antigens. Genes encoding minor H antigens map outside the MHC, on a number of different chromosomes. Whilst gvh and hvg reactions against individual minor H antigens are relatively weak, certainly in comparison with such reactions against MHC antigens, the presence of multiple minor H differences (the situation encountered in man) gives rise to very vigorous reactions that can endanger the survival of graft or host, or both. This is the pathological role of minor H antigens and, indeed, it was this role which was first designated to the MHC antigens, before their physiological role as guidance molecules for T lymphocytes was discovered. Recently, a potential physiological role for minor H antigens has been uncovered by the finding that the presence of certain minor H alleles in mice leads to removal in the thymus (negative selection) of all those T cells expressing a particular T cell receptor (TCR) gene. Such cells therefore never reach the periphery, where they might otherwise give rise to autoimmune reactions. The T cell repertoire is thus moulded by at least some minor H antigens, which may therefore be regarded as non-MHC immune response genes. Furthermore, T cell receptor usage by T cells specific for allogeneic minor H antigens appears not to be representative of T cell receptor usage in the peripheral pool.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2944255": "Previously reported high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays for ciprofloxacin have used cumbersome fluorescence detection. UV absorbance is more commonly used for assay of antibiotics. Separation of ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (internal standard) was achieved using UV absorption at 313 nm, and a reversed phase C-18 Nova-Pak column. The mobile phase consisted of 35% phosphate buffers adjusted to pH 7.4, 65% methanol, and 5.5 mM hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. Retention times were 4.3 and 7.3 min, respectively, for ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid. Serum sample preparation involved protein precipitation with acetonitrile (1:2), followed by methylene chloride and 2-propanol extraction (90:10). After evaporation, reconstitution with a minimal volume of mobile phase allowed for 5X concentration of the sample. The sensitivity limit of the assay was 0.06 microgram/ml. The response was linear from 0.125 to 10.0 micrograms/ml (r greater than 0.999). The coefficient of variation for day-to-day analysis was less than 5.3%, and the recovery was 55%. When compared with microbiological assay in serum, the correlation coefficient was 0.922 (n = 58). This HPLC method using UV detection provided comparable results to those obtained by fluorimetry. Data from three pharmacokinetic studies showed this method to be reliable and accurate.", "PMC2650729": "We investigated the influence of the pressure generated by low lumbar extradural injection of bupivacaine on the development of block in a randomized double-blind study. Thirty patients (aged 17-66 yr) received one of two volumes of 0.75% bupivacaine. Group I (n = 15) received 10 ml (75 mg) and group II (n = 15) 15 ml (112.5 mg). Injection of the larger volume resulted in a greater pressure at the end of injection, but within 1 min this decayed to the same plateau pressure that was produced by the smaller volume. Mean maximum cephalad spread of block was the same in each group (group I, T9.5; group II, T8.4) and there was no correlation between individual level of block and maximum or plateau extradural pressure, or with patient characteristics.", "PMC2232886": "Philadelphia positive multiple myeloma is a very rare event and, so far, no molecular data about the involvement of the BCR and C-ABL genes are available. We report here the case of a 64-year-old woman presenting with a typical multiple myeloma and a complex Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome that we investigated at a molecular level using conventional DNA techniques and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). No rearrangement was observed within the major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR) although she was found to have a P190 BCR/ABL hybrid transcript using PCR. As far as we know, this is the first description of a P190-type mRNA in a patient with a chronic lymphoid disorder. Since P190 is almost always associated in man with acute forms of hematological malignancies, this suggests that other factors may play a role in determining the phenotype of the disease.", "PMC2107478": "The fetal sympathoadrenal system is activated during periods of intrauterine stress such as inadequate uterine perfusion. During cesarean, the period of interruption of utero-placental blood flow is extended as the time interval from uterine incision to delivery increases. An increasing uterine incision-to-delivery interval with spinal or general anesthesia has been associated with a poorer neonatal outcome. This association has not been demonstrated previously in patients undergoing cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia. We investigated the correlation between prolonged uterine incision-to-delivery intervals, fetal catecholamine concentrations, and fetal blood gas values at delivery in 25 parturients undergoing cesarean under epidural anesthesia and in 28 under spinal anesthesia. Infants delivered after prolonged uterine incision-to-delivery intervals had significantly lower pH values in both the epidural and spinal groups. With longer uterine incision-to-delivery intervals, umbilical arterial norepinephrine concentrations were increased significantly. Umbilical arterial pH values were significantly lower in infants with higher umbilical arterial catecholamine concentrations. The importance of minimizing the uterine incision-to-delivery interval, regardless of the type of anesthetic selected, is demonstrated.", "PMC3793755": "To reach an inflammatory lesion, neutrophils must frequently traverse the epithelium of an infected organ. Whether the actual migration of neutrophils alters the epithelial permeability is unknown. Through the use of an in vitro model system it was possible to directly determine the effect of neutrophil emigration on the transepithelial electrical resistance of the monolayer. Human neutrophils (5 X 10(6) cells/ml) were placed in the upper compartment of a combined chemotaxis/resistance chamber and stimulated for 40 min by a gradient of 10(-7) M n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine to traverse a confluent monolayer of canine kidney epithelial cells grown on micropore filters. Neither the chemoattractant alone (10(-5)-10(-9) M) nor the accumulation of an average of eight neutrophils per millimeter of epithelium lowered the transepithelial electrical resistance. However, under certain conditions the migration of neutrophils temporarily increased the permeability of the monolayer. The resistance fell approximately 48% within 5 min if the migratory cells were stimulated to reverse their migration across the same monolayer. As re-migration continued, the resistance returned to its initial levels within 60 min. Doubling the initial neutrophil concentration to 10 X 10(6) cells/ml resulted in the accumulation of an average of 66 neutrophils per millimeter of epithelium and an average fall in resistance of 46% (r = 0.98; P less than 0.001) in 40 min. If the resistance had fallen less than 45%, removal of the neutrophils remaining in the upper compartment resulted in a return of the transepithelial electrical resistance to its initial level within 65 min. However, when the fall was greater than 45%, the resistance only recovered to 23.5% of its initial levels within the same time frame. Thus, these results suggest that the integrity of an epithelium can, under certain conditions, be affected by the emigration of neutrophils, but that this effect is either completely or partially reversible within 65 min.", "PMC550661": "In the central nervous system of the freshwater mussel, Anodonta cygnea, uptake of 3H-dopamine has been investigated by light and electron microscopic autoradiography following in vitro incubation and topical application, respectively. The autoradiographic reaction observed over the ganglia can be taken as a morphological evidence of the existence of a specific uptake mechanism for dopamine. It has been found that labeled dopamine was taken up by the axon profiles and terminals, while perikarya remained free of activity, indicating a basic difference between the perkaryal and axonal membrane in respect of the 3H-dopamine uptake. According to the electron microscopic autoradiography, labeled terminals and axon profiles contained both normal and accentric dense-core vesicles and they proved to be similar to those seen after 3H-serotonin in vitro incubation. Therefore, it seems possible that certain Anodonta central neurons contain both dopamine and serotonin.", "PMC2478619": "One purpose of this study was to examine the concept of T cell immunodominance employing a neonatal tolerance model. The extent to which a single T cell recognition site can represent the total T cell response to hepatitis B core Ag (HBcAg) was examined in the B10.S and B10 murine strains. It was shown that the entire B10.S T cell response to HBcAg was focused on a single immunodominant site represented by residues 120-131. This was demonstrated by exposing B10.S neonatal mice to p120-140 or p120-131, which resulted in a state of T cell tolerance to the entire HBcAg. In contrast, p120-140 contained an immunogenic T cell site for B10 mice, p129-140, but this site was nontolerogenic. Similarly, injection of p120-140 into (B10.S X B10)F1 neonatal mice resulted in tolerization of p120-131-specific, I-As-restricted T cells, but not of p129-140-specific, I-Ab-restricted T cells. The second purpose of this study was to attempt to explain the immunologic basis of an immunogenic yet nontolerogenic T cell determinant. It was shown that the p120-131 T cell site, which is immunogenic and tolerogenic in B10.S mice, could be converted into an immunogenic/nontolerogenic T cell site by a single amino acid substitution in either residue 127 or 129. Residues 127 and 129 were previously shown to be involved in interaction with MHC class II molecules (agretopic). These results demonstrated that the relative avidity of a peptide-MHC interaction can influence T cell tolerance induction. Furthermore, the results suggest that a higher threshold of peptide-MHC avidity may be required to induce T cell tolerance as compared to the threshold of peptide-MHC avidity required to immunize T cells.", "PMC1550243": "Enteropancreatic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-immunoreactive nerve fibers have recently been described. To test the hypothesis that pancreas contains 5-HT receptors similar to those that characterize the enteric nervous system, binding of 5-[3H]HT to pancreatic membranes was investigated. Membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation from guinea pig pancreas, and binding of 5-[3H]HT was measured by use of a rapid filtration assay. Alternatively, 5-[3H]HT-binding sites were analyzed and located by radioautography on frozen sections of unfixed pancreas. The 5-HT1P receptor-specific antagonist, N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptophyl-5-hydroxytryptophan amide (5-HTP-DP), was used to define nonspecific binding in all assays. High-affinity reversible binding of 5-[3H]HT to pancreatic membranes was found. Good agreement was observed when Kd was determined from saturation isotherms (Kd = 2.1 +/- 0.4 nM; Bmax = 0.6 +/- 0.07 pmol/mg protein) or from the ratio of association and dissociation constants (2.7 +/- 0.04 nM). As is true of 5-[3H]HT binding to enteric 5-HT1P receptors, binding of 5-[3H]HT to pancreatic membranes was inhibited by 5-HTP-DP, 5- and 6-hydroxyindalpine (agonists at 5-HT1P receptors), and guanine nucleotides. In contrast, binding of 5-[3H]HT to pancreatic membranes was not inhibited by a variety of compounds known to bind to other types of 5-HT receptor, to the neuronal 5-HT transporter, to alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors, or to dopamine receptors. We concluded that pancreas contains 5-HT1P receptors with properties similar to those of bowel. Radioautography and immunocytochemistry with an anti-idiotypic antibody that recognizes 5-HT receptors revealed that pancreatic 5-HT1P receptors (identified with appropriate inhibitors of 5-[3H]HT or antibody binding) were concentrated in ganglia, nerves, and unidentified cells in both exocrine and endocrine pancreas. These observations suggest that future studies of 5-HT's role in pancreatic physiology should concentrate on enteropancreatic innervation and 5-HT1P receptors.", "PMC3379324": "The effects of intralesional injections of human natural and recombinant interferons-alpha (nIFN-alpha and rIFN-alpha A) were studied in nude mice bearing bilateral xenografts of human mammary carcinoma cells (BT 20, MCF-7). One tumor of each animal received intralesional injections, while the contralateral tumor was left undisturbed. Thus, the injected tumors were subjected to the local action of the IFNs whereas the opposite ones were exposed to the systemic effects of the IFNs seeping into the subcutaneous tissue following the intratumoral injection. When used singly these IFNs exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of both injected and contralateral tumors, but failed to cause complete regression. Many of the cells of treated BT 20 xenografts showed significant morphological alterations (increased cell volume and nuclear pleomorphism) as compared to the untreated controls. Morphological alterations in MCF-7 tumors were difficult to assess because of the inherent pleomorphism of these cells. The immunoreactivity of BT 20 and MCF-7 tumors to monoclonal antibodies directed against milk fat globule proteins and against HLA antigens was not appreciably affected by treatment with these IFNs. This study confirms that intralesional injections of human IFNs-alpha partially inhibit the growth of human breast cancer xenografts, probably through a direct effect on the carcinoma cells. Under the present experimental conditions, the intralesional and the subcutaneous routes of administration appear to offer comparable antitumor effectiveness.", "PMC3972105": "The complete amino acid sequence of cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) from human liver was determined. The 252-residue sequence was obtained by automated solid-phase Edman degradation of the light and heavy chain resulting from limited proteolysis of the single-chain enzyme and of fragments produced by cyanogen bromide and enzymatic cleavage of the heavy chain. Human liver cathepsin B has 83.7% identical residues with the corresponding enzyme from rat liver. Comparison of both mammalian cathepsin B sequences with the sequence of papain provides further evidence that lysosomal and plant cysteine proteinases have evolved from a common ancestor and share a similar catalytic mechanism.", "PMC2589432": "A randomized prospective double-blind study compares the dilatation achieved with Lamicel and Dilapan synthetic dilators in the setting of second-trimester elective abortions. A total of 51 patients with estimated gestational ages of 13 to 16 weeks had either Lamicel dilators or Dilapan dilators placed approximately 20 hours before dilation and evacuation. The placement and removal were by someone other than the operator. The operator then recorded the number of the Pratt dilator at which resistance was first met. The mean for the Lamicel group was French size 38.5 +/- 6.4. The mean for the Dilapan group was French size 50.4 +/- 9.6. In the Dilapan group there were six patients for whom cervical resistance was never reached. The results indicate a significantly greater dilatation was achieved with Dilapan dilators. This correlation was also noted within the subsets of nulliparous and parous patients.", "PMC2770531": "Cases of hexapropymate poisoning requiring intensive care in an urban region of Sweden (420,000 inhabitants) were collected over 2.5 years (1985 to 1987). Only patients with serum hexapropymate concentrations above 5.5 mg/L (30 mumol/L) and with a negative history for intake of tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, barbiturates, antihistaminic drugs and opiates were included. Clinical data about 8 intoxication events in 6 patients were evaluated retrospectively. Initial symptoms included coma, hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoventilation. Maximum coma depth (Glasgow coma score) was 3 to 5 in 5 out of 8 events. On 7 occasions assisted ventilation was required (for 12 hours or more in 5 events). There was no relationship between serum concentrations of hexapropymate and severity of clinical symptoms. All patients survived. Detailed analysis of the drug elimination in one patient showed a terminal elimination half-life of 21 hours, which is longer than previously reported (5 hours). The indications for use of this hypnotic drug may vary between doctors since an 8-fold variation was seen in drug prescription between Swedish counties in 1987. Poisoning with hexapropymate is a serious condition which may require symptomatic treatment in the intensive care unit. The clinical picture is similar to that seen in patients with burbiturate intoxication. There is no role for active forced elimination of the drug. It is questionable whether the clinical value of the drug is outweighted by its toxicity.", "PMC3998973": "Head turning in patients with spasmus nutans seems to transiently dampen the nystagmus.

Involvement of leukotrienes in the effects of GM-CSF is suggested by analytical and pharmacologic evidence obtained in vitro. However, until now no data in support of a role of leukotrienes in GM-CSF action in vivo have been presented. In the present investigation this question was approached by measurement of endogenous cysteinyl leukotriene formation in patients treated with the cytokine for cytopenia induced by cytostatic drugs or for refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). Endogenous cysteinyl leukotriene formation was assessed by determination of urinary leukotriene metabolites using combined high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay analysis. After GM-CSF administration a distinct increase in urinary cysteinyl leukotrienes was found in the cytopenic and the RAEB patients that ranged from 2.3- to 57-fold and 2.4- to 333-fold, respectively. In the cytopenic patients the increase in leukotriene production was correlated to an expansion of peripheral blood leukocytes; RAEB patients responded to GM-CSF with enhanced leukotriene biosynthesis even if the peripheral leukocytes decreased, possibly due to an abnormal number and/or irritability of leukotriene-producing cells. The increase in endogenous leukotriene production during therapy with GM-CSF may indicate that leukotrienes play a role in GM-CSF action in vivo.", "PMC3123238": "This paper presents case reports of patients suffering from myoclonic-astatic and stimulus-sensitive myoclonic seizures, respectively.

A new modified technique is described that has potential advantages of ease, rapidity, less dissection, and less blood loss than may be seen with the modified Pereyra procedure and less chance of foreign body reaction than may be seen with the Stamey procedure. Twenty patients with significant stress urinary incontinence (14 with concurrent severe pelvic relaxation) underwent the procedure with an 80% cure plus 5% significant improvement rate noted 12 to 39 months after operation. All failures occurred in patients who were obese and involved apparent suture pull-through. Complications were minimal. Suggested causes for failures are discussed.", "PMC1568127": "A new approach to search for common patterns in many sequences is presented. The idea is that one sequence from the set of sequences to be compared is considered as a 'basic' one and all its similarities with other sequences are found. Multiple similarities are then reconstructed using these data. This approach allows one to search for similar segments which can differ in both substitutions and deletions/insertions. These segments can be situated at different positions in various sequences. No regions of complete or strong similarity within the segments are required. The other parts of the sequences can have no similarity at all. The only requirement is that the similar segments can be found in all the sequences (or in the majority of them, given the common segments are present in the basic sequence). Working time of an algorithm presented is proportional to n.L2 when n sequences of length L are analyzed. The algorithm proposed is implemented as programs for the IBM-PC and IBM/370. Its applications to the analysis of biopolymer primary structures as well as the dependence of the results on the choice of basic sequence are discussed.", "PMC2224120": "All-trans retinoic acid induces leukemic cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) to differentiate in vitro to mature granulocytes which express the CD15 antigen and are capable of respiratory burst function. Of 35 M3 samples, only one failed to respond. In eight cases, we compared the efficacy of two naturally occurring isomers of retinoic acid, all-trans RA and 13-cis RA. Both isomers induce maximal differentiation at 10(-6) mol/L. The maximal response was maintained at 10(-7) mol/L for the all-trans but not for the 13-cis RA. We also observed that the metabolites 4-oxo-all-trans and 4-oxo-13-cis were effective at 10(-6) mol/L. This 1 order of magnitude difference in the in vitro differentiating potencies of all-trans RA and 13-cis RA in the blasts of promyelocytic leukemias predicts a difference in the clinical efficacy of the two drugs.", "PMC2391252": "Recent clinical reports of nonresponsiveness to noninherited maternal human leukocyte antigens have led to speculation that humans may acquire tolerance of noninherited maternal antigens through exposure to maternal cells neonatally or in utero. To test this hypothesis, we measured the responsiveness of normal subjects to their noninherited maternal and paternal antigens using cell-mediated lympholysis assays and mixed leukocyte reactions. All individuals exhibited cell-mediated lympholysis and mixed leukocyte reaction responses to the maternal cells that were comparable to those to the paternal cells. Limiting dilution analyses revealed significant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor frequencies to both sets of parental antigens. To exclude the possibility that tolerance of individual noninherited maternal antigens was masked by the response to other antigens expressed on the same target cell, we raised cytotoxic T lymphocytes to the maternal cells and then tested for reactivity to a panel of targets that expressed single noninherited maternal HLA antigens. In all cases, each noninherited maternal antigen expressed on the maternal cells elicited a significant cell-mediated lympholysis response. An analysis of clinical data showed that pretransplant mixed lymphocyte reactions to maternal cells are not significantly lower than those to paternal cells. These data suggest that the reported B-cell tolerance of noninherited maternal antigens is not mediated by clonal deletion of T cells induced by exposure to the maternal cells neonatally or in utero.", "PMC2391253": "The majority of patients with reactive arthritis have the major histocompatibility complex class I gene HLA-B27. The development of arthritis in these patients often occurs following infection with one of several enteric bacteria, including Yersinia enterocolitica. In this study, transgenic mice expressing HLA-B27 and their negative full sibs were infected intravenously with Yersinia enterocolitica 0:8 WA in an attempt to develop an experimental model of reactive arthritis. To date, no reactive arthritis has been observed; however, a significantly higher incidence of paralysis was observed in the HLA-B27+ transgenic mice. Injection of 10(5) organisms induced hind limb paralysis in 8 out of 30 of the HLA-B27 transgenic mice (27%) and in only 1 of the 24 negative siblings (4%). Paralysis occurred in 14 out of 30 HLA-B27+ mice (47%) at a dose of 10(4) organisms. Only 2 of the 25 negative siblings (8%) were affected at this dose. Paraspinal abscesses were found in all of the paralyzed animals. At the 10(4) dose most of the HLA-B27+ mice (70%) succumbed to the disease within 4 weeks, while the mortality in their B27- full sibs was less than 10%. Thus, HLA-B27 transgenic mice have higher mortality and morbidity from infection with Y. enterocolitica 0:8 WA than corresponding HLA-B27- littermates.", "PMC2136106": "A 2-year cross-sequential analysis of informal self-change efforts at smoking cessation evaluated the use of coping operations and the mediation of cognitive judgments among four composite profiles. Subjects (N = 544) were grouped by stage of readiness to change (contemplation, action, relapse, and maintenance) and assessed every 6 months on 10 change processes, self-efficacy, and the decisional balance between the \"pros\" and \"cons\" of smoking. Two change status profiles, contemplation to maintenance, and relapse to maintenance, were selected as exemplars of optimal linear progress; two others, chronic contemplation and chronic relapse, illustrated nonprogressing patterns in which subjects remained stuck in the same stage for 2 years. Multivariate and univariate ANOVA results indicated that nonprogressing smokers overutilize certain experiential change processes rather than underutilizing behavioral strategies, as was predicted. Implications of these results for specialized self-help interventions are discussed in the context of a comprehensive model of change for the addictive behaviors.", "PMC425589": "In 6 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and in 6 healthy controls the elimination half life of the serum leucine level (t 1/2 Leu) was determined after intravenous administration of 50 mg leucine per kg bodyweight. Examinations were repeated with simultaneous administration of 0,33 g glucose per kg bodyweight and during a continuous infusion of 500 microgram somatostatin over 60 minutes. The following results were obtained: 1. In cirrhotics and in healthy controls the t 1/2 Leu was shortened during the additional glucose administration compared with the t 1/2 Leu after leucine administration alone and was prolonged by inhibiting insulin secretion by somatostatin. 2. In spite of significantly higher serum insulin levels the t 1/2 Leu in patients with cirrhosis of the liver was significantly prolonged compared with healthy controls after leucine administration as well after leucine and glucose administration. Therefore we conclude, that in patients with cirrhosis of the liver in spite of elevated serum insulin levels leucine as well as glucose are metabolized slower. These results are indicating peripheral insulin resistance regarding the assimilation of glucose and leucine (at least in patients with portocaval shunts).", "PMC2374690": "The health consequences of long-term professional activity in loading for transport were investigated in an epidemiological study. This involved determining the frequency of orthopedic diseases within a series of transport workers and comparing it with the disease frequency in a comparable group with the same age distribution. The frequency of orthopedic diseases in transport workers is about 22% higher than in the other group. Most of the findings relate to the lower lumbar spine. An increase in the number of diseases can be observed in the transport workers even after a short period of professional activity. In order to examine the possible cause for the increased frequency of disease, the load on the lower lumbar spine was determined quantitatively using biomechanical model calculations. A three-dimensional biomechanical model that allows examination of both static and dynamic load was developed for this purpose. The influence of posture, the mass of the load to be transferred, and the acceleration of the load and the body on the mechanical spinal load were examined as typical examples of load manipulation. In the assessment of load, the compressive forces calculated were compared with the strength of the spinal elements. The compression forces on the lower lumbar spine are of the same order of magnitude as the strength. The high mechanical load can therefore be regarded as a possible cause of the high frequency of disease among persons whose professional activity involves lifting heavy loads.", "PMC3507260": "Sister chromatid exchange rate was studied in 12 early diagnosed cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and in their paired controls.

In the first experiment, ovariectomized (OVX), phenobarbital-pretreated rats were given pulses of LH-RH (1.25 or 6.25 ng/100 g body weight (b.w.), intravenously). In rats given 1.25 ng at time 0, 6.25 ng at 60 min, 1.25 ng at 80 min and 1.25 ng at 120 min, there was a substantial increase in plasma LH after the first two injections, no increase after the third injection and a relatively small increase after the fourth one. In other rats treated identically but not given a 1.25-ng dose at 80 min, the plasma LH rise in response to the 1.25-ng dose at 120 min was comparable to that seen after the 1.25-ng dose given at time 0. If the 1.25-ng LH-RH pulses given at times 0 and 80 min were replaced by a rat pituitary extract, the plasma LH rise in response to the 1.25-ng dose at 120 min was comparable to that seen after administration of pituitary extract. In the second experiment, OVX phenobarbital-pretreated rats were given 1.25 ng LH-RH/100 g b.w. at t = 0. They were then divided into three groups, each receiving 1.25, 3.75 or 6.25 ng LH-RH/100 g b.w. at t = 60 min.

Introduction of gluten free diet invariably led to clinical improvement, in the four patients in whom also rebiopsy was performed the jejunal mucosa exhibited improvement. In all cases gluten sensitive enteropathy was diagnosed after the onset of diabetes. Marked stunting in growth, strikingly labile carbohydrate tolerance, pronounced proneness to hypoglycaemia or development of Mauriac's syndrome were the symptoms pointing to coeliac disease. Protracted diarrhoea was seen only in two patients, pronounced deceleration in weight development occurred in none of the six children. In four patients out of six the presence of both HLA B8 and DR3 antigens was demonstrated, in a fifth patient only DR3 was present; this suggests a common genetic background of the simultaneous occurrence of the two disorders. Untreated coeliac disease aggravates preexisting diabetes.

We have found that aneural muscle cultures that become or are provoked into an extremely contractile state will begin to synthesize a pattern of myosin light chains typical of maturing muscle. Immunoblots with neonatal and adult specific monoclonal antibodies did not reveal a corresponding isozyme transition in myosin heavy chain. These results demonstrate a correlation between contractility and the regulation of myosin light chain maturation, and also suggest that the transitions of heavy and light chain synthesis during development do not appear to be under close coordinate regulation.", "PMC3676452": "The experiments on adult freely behaving cats have shown that the injection of penicillin into the internal part (TI) of bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) caused the formation of the generator of pathologically enhanced excitation (GPEE).

The more-primitive progenitor cells identical to or closely related to the human pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, on the other hand, did not support viral replication. The B19 progeny virus produced by the enriched erythroid progenitor cells was infectious and strongly suppressed erythropoiesis in vitro. The susceptibility of both the more-primitive erythroid progenitors (burst-forming units-erythroid) and the more-mature erythroid progenitors (CFU-erythroid) to the cytolytic response of the virus and the lack of effect on the myeloid progenitors (CFU-granulocyte-macrophage) further give evidence to the remarkable tropism of the B19 parvovirus for human hematopoietic cells of erythroid lineage.", "PMC2217228": "1) There exists a CR of GR in human leukocytes, PMN, and monocytes with the peak values from 0400 to 0800 hr and the trough values between 2300 and 0000 hr. The difference between them was significant statistically. 2) The FI of the chemotactic migration rate of PMN by cortisol also showed diurnal changes which were synchronous with that of GR. This indicates that the CR of GR may be of functional significance. 3) In Cushing's syndrome, the CR of GR was normal in spite of the fact that the CR of plasma cortisol was disturbed. This indicates the independency of the CR of GR from that of cortisol. 4) In apoplexy caused by brain ischemia, the CR of GR was abolished in patients with basal lesions but preserved when the lesions were located in the cerebral cortex. These results strongly suggest that the main \"circadian pacemaker\" of GR is located in the basal brain, most probably in the suprachiasmatic nuclei as has been suggested for rodents.", "PMC2982178": "Arteriograms of the hands were carried out in 348 patients.

The overall compliance in accepting this particular PHC approach for cancer screening, as estimated by arrival at a referral centre manned by consultant staff, was 54.1%. Nearly 80% of those who turned up without needing an additional reminder, did so within the first 2 weeks of case finding. There was a variation in the degree of compliance depending on the primary health care worker who did the screening and referral. Compliance was greater when the screening area was nearer to the referral centre and in subjects who were diagnosed as having a more advanced stage of the disease.

All seven of the clones were DPw2 specific and indistinguishable in specificity by three approaches: (a) patterns of lysis of panels of targets from normal donors; (b) inhibition of lysis by anti-class II monoclonal antibodies (mAb); (c) lysis of mutant lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCL) with isolated loss of DP2 alpha or DP2 beta gene expression (as a result of selection for resistance to DPw2-specific CTL). However, only four of the seven CTL clones (which we designate \"orthodox\") lysed all mutant DPw2+ LCL tested; the other three (\"heterodox\") CTL clones showed reduced or no lysis of particular LCL which expressed DPw2 but had been mutagenized and selected for loss of DR expression. Cold target blocking experiments with the mutant LCL confirmed differences in: (a) specificity among CTL clones and (b) CTL-defined phenotype among serologically indistinguishable DR-DPw2+ mutant LCL. Differences were not explained by different levels of DP expression by the mutant LCL. Given the nature of the mutagens and mutations, it is highly improbable that point mutations in DP account for differences in recognition. These data suggest that non-DP HLA genes influence recognition by some DP-specific clones, potentially due to corecognition of HLA-DR alpha or another non-DP HLA product in the context of a DPw2 alpha/beta dimer.", "PMC2132452": "One case of human palpebral dirofilariasis by Dirofilaria repens, in Abruzzo, is described.

Ethionine administration resulted in a dose- and time-dependent enhancement of the palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activity both in the mitochondrial, peroxisomal and microsomal fractions. The total carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity in the mitochondrial fraction was enhanced. Ethionine administration was also associated with dose- and time-dependent changes of the microsomal glycerophosphate acyltransferase activity, whereas the mitochondrial enzyme activity was marginally affected. The hepatic triacylglycerol content of the ethionine-treated animals was increased. Hepatic lipids were accumulated in large droplets. Serum triacylglycerol and cholesterol were decreased. In particular, the serum HDL-cholesterol level was lowered. The concentration of ATP in the liver decreased. Accumulation of the metabolic product S-adenosylethionine (AdoEth) was observed for the first 2 days of exposure followed by a fall in S-adenosylmethionine (Ado-Met) during the next 10 days. Linear regression analysis of ATP content versus AdoEth and AdoMet showed highly significant correlations. A significant correlation between the hepatic triacylglycerol and AdoEth content was also observed upon ethionine treatment. The data show that ethionine perturbs the hepatic lipid metabolism. Enhanced esterification of long-chain fatty acids, but not a simple reduction of their oxidation, might contribute to ethionine-induced fatty liver in addition to a block in secretion of lipoproteins and decreased protein synthesis.", "PMC3223614": "Alterations in the surface topography of cells in the apical neural folds of the posterior neuropore were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy in normal (+/+) and abnormal (vl/vl) embryos characterized by lumbosacral dysraphism. In early embryos (14-25 somites) surface features distinguishing the neuroepithelial cells, transitional zone cells, and surface ectoderm cells were similar in normal and abnormal embryos, as were the arrangement and configuration of filopodia and lamellipodia. However, in embryos with approximately 26-36 somites, the transitional zone of the abnormals showed a profusion of large blebs and excrescences along the entire length of the posterior neuropore. By 36 somites, the posterior neuropore was still variably open in the abnormals, in contrast to normal embryos in which no external opening could be detected. In view of the abnormalities associated with the transitional zone, it is possible that the underlying mechanism that results in lumbosacral spina bifida in this mutant may involve putative neural crest cells.", "PMC2150085": "Radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) is a clinically important cause of acute renal failure with no effective treatment. Recognizing the high incidence of RCIN in humans with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), this study was designed to test the hypotheses that dogs with experimental CHF are at increased risk for RCIN and that pharmacologic renal levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) can prevent RCIN in this model. In chronic experiments, three groups of five conscious dogs received intravenous radiocontrast (7 ml/kg). One group consisted of normal controls, while the two other groups had experimental CHF induced by eight days of ventricular pacing at 250 beats per minute. One of the CHF groups received an infusion of ANF (30 ng/kg/min) into the suprarenal aorta for one hour before, during and after the infusion of radiocontrast to achieve pharmacologic renal plasma levels. Renal function remained stable in the normal controls in contrast to the consistent decreases in daily creatinine clearance during the five days following radiocontrast in experimental CHF. In addition, ANF prevented radiocontrast-induced reductions in creatinine clearance in dogs with experimental CHF. Additional studies performed in two groups of anesthetized dogs with experimental CHF demonstrated that, in this model of RCIN, the reduction in renal function appears biphasic, and the action of ANF may be to increase glomerular filtration rate prior to radiocontrast, thus allowing a maintenance of renal function during and after radiocontrast.", "PMC317295": "Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the anterior eye chamber of rats and mice and frozen sections from both superior cervical and trigeminal ganglia were incubated to demonstrate neurons accumulating the tracer by retrograde axonal transport. Labelled cells were observed only in ganglia ipsilateral to the HRP injection. Within the trigeminal ganglion, peroxidase-containing neurons were restricted to the medial ophthalmic area, whereas labelled cells in the superior cervical ganglion were more widely distributed. With the use of a new and more sensitive technique for the demonstration of HRP in neurons, it was possible to show retrograde transport also of small amounts of peroxidase injected into the anterior eye chamber. In addition, this technique enabled identification of the central and peripheral processes of neurons in the trigeminal ganglion and the dendrites and axons of sympathetic ganglion cells. The rate of retrograde HRP transport in rats was calculated to approximately 4--5 mm/h for both sensory and adrenergic nerves, which is consistent with previous estimates for this protein. It differs from the transport rate reported for nerve growth factor (NGF) and macromolecular toxins in sensory and adrenergic nerves of the same species. These rates were, however, obtained with a different method and in a different population of sensory neurons and are, therefore, not directly comparable. After treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine the number of HRP-labelled cells in the superior cervical ganglion was significantly reduced compared to controls.

Doxazosin is a postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker suitable for once a day treatment regime. It seems to induce fewer side effects than older drugs of the same class and it may improve lipid and carbohydrate profile, thereby reducing the risk of coronary artery disease. To verify its effects on blood pressure, serum lipids and glucose tolerance, doxazosin (1-8 mg od) was given for 8 weeks to 32 patients suffering from essential hypertension, of whom 16 had fasting serum cholesterol higher than 6 mmol/l and/or fasting serum triglycerides higher than 1.9 mmol/l. Sitting and standing blood pressure were significantly reduced (from 163 +/- 18/101 +/- 6 mmHg to 147 +/- 19/94 +/- 8, p less than 0.001 and from 162 +/- 18/107 +/- 9 to 145 +/- 18/95 +/- 8, p less than 0.001, respectively) at a mean daily dose of 5 mg. Normotension or a good hypotensive response was achieved in 60% of the patients. The daily dose which turned out to be effective in 50% of the patients was 7 mg. The drug treatment was well tolerated and orthostatic hypotension was never observed either on starting treatment or on increasing dosage.

In both cell lines, serotonin induced a dose-dependent, transient rise of cytosolic Ca2+ activity (measured by fura-2 or indo-1 fluorescence). Ca2+ channel blockers (Ni2+ and La3+, not nifedipine) suppressed the Ca2+ response to serotonin in the hybrid cells but not in the glioma cells. After application of Ca2+ ionophores (ionomycin and A23187) in order to short-circuit internal Ca2+ stores, serotonin was still able to induce a Ca2+ response in the hybrid cells but not in the glioma cells. Serotonin dose-dependently stimulated the rate of 45Ca2+ uptake several-fold in the hybrid cells, but hardly at all in the glioma cells. Thus, in the neuronal cell line cytosolic Ca2+ activity is raised through enhancement of Ca2+ entry into the cells from the extracellular environment via 5-HT3 receptors (blocked by ICS 205-930, MDL 72222 and GR 38032 F). The depolarization response caused by serotonin in the hybrid cells is due to activation of cation conductance(s), obviously allowing entry of extracellular Ca2+. In contrast to the neuronal cell line, in the glial cell line the rise of Ca2+ activity is mediated by ketanserin-susceptible 5-HT2 receptors (not affected by treatment with pertussis toxin) mainly liberating Ca2+ from internal stores. In the glioma cells the release of Ca2+ from internal stores leads to opening of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, responsible for the hyperpolarizing response. Thus, the neuronal and the glial cell lines might provide suitable systems in which to study the diverse cellular functions triggered by the rise of cytosolic Ca2+ activity, which is caused by different serotonin receptors.", "PMC2150088": "The lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase (Hex) was studied immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody in normal human livers and in livers with cirrhosis and cholestasis. No reaction was detected in sections from normal livers.

The reaction product was intense in degenerated hepatocytes, especially in the periphery of the pseudolobules in cirrhotic livers. In cholestatic livers the positivity was localized around central veins in cells with bile pigment. The more pigment, the stronger was the reaction.

To investigate the effects of heat on this cell structure, Chinese hamster V79 fibroblasts were exposed to 43 degrees C hyperthermia for 1 h, immediately fixed with glutaraldehyde after treatment, and freeze-fractured for electron microscopic examination. Particular attention was given to the density and size of intramembranous particles (IMPs) on both protoplasmic (PF) and external (EF) fracture faces of the plasma membrane. The quantitative study performed by an interactive image analyzer on the IMPs, generally reported as plasma membrane proteins, showed in heat-treated cells a statistically significant increase in their density and size on both fracture faces. The differences observed demonstrate that in our experimental conditions, hyperthermia in plasma membranes produces structural changes whose biological significance has to be clarified.

After a 2.5-h labeling period with [35S]methionine the high-mannose-type precursor of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (Mr 49000) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Mr 39 000) and the mature-complex-type alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (Mr 54 000) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Mr 43 000-60 000) could be immunoprecipitated from the cells, but only the complex-type forms of the two glycoproteins were secreted into the hepatocyte media. When hepatocytes were incubated with the mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin at a concentration of 4 mM, the 49 000-Mr form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and the 39 000-Mr form of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein could be detected in the cells as well as in their media. Neither the secretion of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor nor that of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was impaired by 1-deoxymannojirimycin. While alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, secreted by control cells, were resistant to endoglucosaminidase H, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, secreted by hepatocytes treated with 4 mM 1-deoxymannojirimycin, could be deglycosylated by endoglucosaminidase H. When the [3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, secreted by 1-deoxymannojirimycin-treated hepatocytes, were cleaved off by endoglucosaminidase H and analyzed by Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography, they eluted at the position of Man9GlcNAc, indicating that mannosidase I had been efficiently inhibited. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin did not inhibit the synthesis or the cotranslational N-glycosylation of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor or alpha 1-acid glycoprotein.", "PMC2363413": "Previous descriptions of hereditary high-phosphatidylcholine hemolytic anemia (HPCHA) have highlighted the association of increased erythrocyte membrane phosphatidylcholine with abnormal membrane cation permeability. We studied the function and composition of erythrocyte membranes from three individuals with HPCHA to characterize further the membrane abnormalities in this disorder. Despite significant macrocytosis, HPCHA red cells were dehydrated and showed an increased surface area to volume ratio compared to normal red cells. The passive efflux of K+ from HPCHA erythrocytes was increased fourfold at 37 degrees C. Total membrane phospholipid was increased 7-42%, largely due to excess phosphatidylcholine, which made up 35.8-37.2% of total phospholipid. Membrane cholesterol:phospholipid ratios were in the normal range. It appears that the excess phosphatidylcholine was not acquired during circulation, since plasma lipids were normal and all subpopulations of density-separated HPCHA erythrocytes were similarly abnormal. The ratio of total protein to phospholipid in white ghosts was increased, indicating that membrane protein was increased to an even greater extent than membrane lipids. No abnormal membrane proteins were identified by Coomassie or periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Quantitation of the major membrane proteins indicated that the total protein excess in HPCHA membranes was due to a proportional increase in all major proteins. We conclude that HPCHA erythrocytes have excess membrane proteins and hypothesize that the changes in lipid composition and cation permeability are secondary to underlying protein abnormalities, which remain to be defined.", "PMC4582931": "We compared Index Medicus and Drug Literature Index during a search concerning the toxicity of eight drugs used in treating tropical diseases.

Mixtures of recombinant(r) TNF, rLT, rIFN alpha, rIFN gamma, rIL-1 alpha and rIL-2 were still unable to produce cytotoxic effects on fresh human tumor cells. Treatment with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against rTNF, rLT, rIFN alpha, rIFN gamma, or rIL-1 alpha did not inhibit the cytotoxic activity of LGL-derived cytotoxic factor against fresh human tumor cells. Even a mixture of all the antibodies was incapable of blocking the cytolytic activity of the factor to fresh human tumor cells. Furthermore, intact LGL-mediated lysing of autologous tumor cells was not inhibited by any of the antibodies. These results may indicate that a cytotoxic factor produced by LGL in response to autologous tumor cells mediates lysing of fresh human tumor cells independently of TNF, LT, IFN, IL-1 and IL-2.", "PMC3341254": "This study analyzes whether increased body weight is related to histological liver damage in chronic alcoholic patients. Data from 152 recently abstinent alcoholics without evidences of liver failure were analyzed. Liver biopsies were scored for the presence of fat, necrosis, fibrosis, inflammation, and Mallory material. Total histological score correlated significantly with body weight (BW), length of alcoholism (L), and age (A) but not with the amount of ethanol ingested (E). Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis with histological score as the dependent variable gave significant F values for BW and L but not for A. Patients with severe damage had higher BW than patients with mild damage. The group with BW greater than 110% showed a higher histological score. These results confirm the association between increased BW and liver damage in asymptomatic alcoholic patients suggesting that overweight is a risk factor for alcoholic liver disease.", "PMC3397235": "Surface and 'core' tonsillar specimens were collected from 60 children, between 2 and 14 years of age, suffering from recurrent tonsillitis, in order to establish the reliability of surface tonsillar swabbing technique and to define the most frequently involved aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. From the qualitative point of view, the same mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained in both samples thus demonstrating the reliability of the surface swabbing technique. From the quantitative point of view, 187 microorganisms, 129 (69.2%) aerobes and 58 (30.8%) anaerobes were isolated from surface cultures while 184, 109 (59.2%) aerobes and 75 (40.8%) anaerobes from the core cultures, thus demonstrating a greater number of anaerobes in the core of the tonsil. The most common isolated aerobic microorganisms were the alpha- and beta-hemolytic Streptococci, the Neisseriae and the Staphylococcus aureus; the predominant anaerobic ones were the Fusobacterium nucleatum, the Bacteroides sp. and the Veillonella parvula. The isolated staphylococcus aureus and the bacteroides sp. were all beta-lactamase producers.", "PMC3805546": "A series of patients was identified who demonstrated immediate positive skin tests to intradermal Trichophyton extract. These skin responses did not correlate with other fungal skin tests and were present both in atopic and nonatopic patients. The individuals demonstrating positive immediate skin tests included patients with urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and/or rhinitis, as well as five of 34 normal control subjects. Most skin test positive individuals had a history of local fungal infection and clinical signs suggestive of fungal infection. By use of Trichophyton tonsurans extract linked to Sepharose as the immunosorbent, it was possible to measure IgE antibodies in 26/30 sera from skin test positive individuals. With strongly positive sera, RAST bound up to 30% of the radiolabeled anti-IgE added. The results confirm that most skin test positive individuals have IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to Trichophyton. These observations support the older view that absorption of dermatophyte allergen through the skin should be considered as a possible cause of allergic disease.", "PMC3781757": "When rats consumed a well-balanced diet containing 30% lactose or 30% glucose-galactose mixture, some differences of metabolic utilization arose between males and females.

Ruthenium Red (2.5-10.0 muM) reduces the synaptic potential to subthreshold levels. An analysis of this phenomenon shows that the main action of Ruthenium Red is on the presynaptic nerve terminal where it decreases the number of quanta of transmitter liberated by the nerve impulse. It has the following additional effects: a reduction in the amplitude of the spontaneous miniature end plate potentials; an increase in their frequency; and an increase in delayed release of transmitter after a nerve impulse. Some of these results are discussed in terms of the known inhibitory action of Ruthenium Red on calcium transport across mitochondrial membranes.", "PMC3239107": "In blood samples of 54 obese persons (13 men, 41 women) some lipid components, malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activities of free radical protecting enzymes superoxide-dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-peroxidase (GSHpx), were determined before and after a seven-day slimming diet of 2.1 MJ/day. Body weight, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and HDL-3-cholesterol all decreased, total cholesterol increased after the seven days hospitalization. After continuing the slimming diet (5.0-6.3 MJ/day) at home, HDL-2-cholesterol increased and total cholesterol returned to the initial value after three months. MDA decreased in the groups of hyperlipoproteinemia II/a and II/b and also in the group with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels (above 5.7 and 2.7 mmol/l). Correlation coefficients refer to the dominant role of high TG in the intensity of lipid peroxidation. The activity of SOD fell after the slimming, independent of lipid parameters. GSHpx activity remained unchanged except a drop in the male participants having high cholesterol levels.

Differentiation of excitable cells was studied electrophysiologically and histochemically in cleavage-arrested blastomeres isolated from early ascidian embryos. Blastomeres were isolated at the 4- or 8-cell stage, and cultured in sea water containing cytochalasin B until the time of hatching of control larvae. Electrical responses, immunoreactivity to epidermis-specific monoclonal antibody (2C5) and activity of muscle-specific acetylcholinesterase were examined. 2. All cleavage-arrested blastomeres isolated from an 8-cell embryo differentiated to elicit either muscular- or epidermal-type action potentials, but no neural-type action potentials were observed in these blastomeres. The anterior-animal and the posterior-animal blastomeres developed only epidermal-type action potentials, which involved expression of Ca2+ channels and immunoreactivity to 2C5. One-third of anterior-vegetal blastomeres developed epidermal-type action potentials which are mediated by Ca2+ channels though the immunoreactivity to 2C5 was absent. A majority of remaining blastomeres showed action potentials composed of Ca2+ currents and TEA-sensitive delayed K+ currents (type I response), and a few of them had fast transient K+ currents (A-currents) in addition (type II response). One-third of posterior-vegetal blastomeres developed epidermal-type action potentials without expression of the immunoreactivity to 2C5. The remainder differentiated into muscular-type cells, which expressed Ca2+ currents, TEA-sensitive and TEA-insensitive delayed K+ currents, and showed acetylcholinesterase activity. 3. Cleavage-arrested blastomeres isolated from a 4-cell embryo also differentiated into epidermal- or muscular-type cells, but not neural-type cells. The anterior blastomere, which is the parent cell of anterior-animal and anterior-vegetal blastomeres of an 8-cell embryo, developed epidermal-type, type I or type II responses, as was the case in the anterior-vegetal blastomere isolated from an 8-cell embryo. The posterior blastomere, which was the parent cell of posterior-animal and posterior-vegetal blastomeres of an 8-cell embryo, differentiated into either epidermal-type or muscular-type cells in terms of both membrane excitability and immunochemical reactivity. 4.

In this paper we turn to the more realistic problem in which neither period nor cohort effects alone lead to an adequate description of the data. We describe the age-period-cohort model and show how its ambiguities surrounding regular trends 'intensify'.

However, as yet there is no model system available to investigate the interaction of HIV with the developing human nervous system in vitro. To approximate the intracellular events associated with HIV infection of the human fetus nervous system we infected cells obtained by enzymatic dissociation of aborted human fetus dorsal root ganglia and their attached spinal roots and nerves. The expression of the HIV gag gene protein products (p17 and p24) was detected in a subpopulation of cells with a nonneuronal morphology, reaching a maximum within 3 days. Although 70% of the nonneuronal cells were p17- and p24-positive 3 days after infection, a majority of the cell population survived acute HIV infection, with the expression of p17 and p24 decreasing below the limit of detection by 12 days postinfection.

Fifty-three were asymptomatic, and 45 were symptomatic. Thirteen prostheses required revision surgery. At a mean of 54 months, asymptomatic knee replacements generally showed only mild uptake in one or more zones. Only one knee had uptake equal to surrounding bone. However, symptomatic knee replacements showed significantly greater uptake in the patella, femur, and medial and lateral tibial plateau regions (Mann-Whitney two-sample rank test). Bone scans in the symptomatic group were obtained at a mean of 44 months. Excluding those patients who had revision surgery, the differences remained significant. Furthermore, symptomatic knee replacements with normal roentgenograms also had significantly greater uptake.

Recent technical advances in immunochemistry make this contribution even more essential than in the past. The author reviews the classic principles of immunological diagnosis in infectious pathology. In the best cases, this diagnosis is based on parasite identification (in the broad sense), or identification of specific products from the parasite. It is also possible to consider shortening culture time, when necessary, by performing an early immunological identification. The most recent developments in this field are presented. When the identification of the parasite or its secretion products is not feasible, one must be content to demonstrate the occurrence of a specific immune response, essentially of humoral nature. The author reminds of the basic theoretical difficulties preventing a real analytic antibody titration. The importance of the expression of the results as well as the predictive value of the tests, is stressed. Finally, the author analyzes some of the recent advances such as the development of immuno-enzymatic techniques, rapid testing which can be performed by non-biologists, the contribution of monoclonal antibodies and the possibility of using them in a new detection diagram of antibodies.

Scans were obtained by injecting 1-2 mCi of technetium-labeled albumin macroaggregates as the lambs were ventilated with air, with 10-14% O2 in N2, or with air while receiving angiotensin II intravenously. We found that both alveolar hypoxia and infusion of angiotensin II increased pulmonary vascular resistance and redistributed blood flow from the mid and lower lung regions towards the upper posterior region of the lung. We assessed the effects of angiotensin II infusion on filtration pressure in six lambs by measuring the rate of lung lymph flow and the protein concentration of samples of lung lymph. We found that angiotensin II infusion increased pulmonary arterial pressure 50%, lung lymph flow 90%, and decreased the concentration of protein in lymph relative to plasma. These results are identical to those seen when filtration pressure increases during alveolar hypoxia. We conclude that alveolar hypoxia and angiotensin II infusion both increase fluid filtration in the lung by increasing filtration pressure. The increase in filtration pressure may be the result of a redistribution of blood flow in the lung with relative overperfusion of vessels in some areas and transmission of the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure to fluid-exchanging sites in those vessels.", "PMC3884306": "Prescription patterns of physicians in a family practice residency office were analyzed retrospectively from the following perspectives: frequency of prescribing for individual drugs and drug categories; effect of the level of postgraduate training on prescribing patterns; and effect of patient payment systems (Medicare-Medicaid, self-pay, third-party insurance) on the number of prescriptions. Antibiotics, antihistamine-decongestants, and antihypertensive medications were the most commonly prescribed medications. Psychotropic medications were used infrequently.

Individual components of the system included a bicruciate-retaining meniscal bearing, a posterior cruciate-retaining meniscal bearing, and a cruciate-sacrificing, rotating-platform tibial component mated to the same femoral and rotating patellar components. Survivorship analysis of each implant type was performed to identify specific failure modes and trends for long-term survival of the implants in a wide variety of primary knee arthroplasties. Clinically, there were 46 prostheses of the bicruciate type followed for up to 12 years, 57 prostheses of the posterior-cruciate type followed for up to six years, and 108 prostheses of the rotating-platform type followed for up to ten years. All knees in this study had rotating-bearing patellar prostheses. Cumulative survivorship analysis using an end point of implant revision or a poor knee score revealed a small early failure rate of each implant in the first three years, associated with technical positioning or undersizing errors.

The speed and intensity of the reaction was dependent on both the concentration of dye and pH. Within a range of pH 3.0 to 10.0, staining was most rapid at pH 5.0 to 6.0, with a slower and less intense reaction occurring at the other pH values. As the concentration of dye at either pH 5.0 or 9.0 was increased from 10 to 1,000 mug/ml, there was an increase in the rate of staining but a decrease in cell viability. After 24 hr of incubation at 4 C, pH 5.0, and a dye concentration of 10 mug/ml, all cells were stained, the majority exhibiting intense fluorescence with little or no loss of viability noted.

Ovariectomized adult guinea pigs were given 20 micrograms estradiol benzoate (EB) or oil vehicle for 3 successive days. CPRs were measured using the synthetic progestin [3H]-R5020. The highest basal (no estrogen treatment) level of CPRs was seen in the arcuate-median eminence (34.1 +/- 3.7 fmol/mg). With EB treatment, the highest level of CPRs was again in the arcuate-median eminence (178.0 +/- 12.0 fmol/mg). EB-treated females also had high CPR levels in the periventricular area (88.5 +/- 10.8 fmol/mg) and the medial preoptic area (86.3 +/- 9.3 fmol/mg). Moderate levels were seen in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (32.7 +/- 3.0 fmol/mg) and in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (13.0 +/- 2.1 fmol/mg), but these were not significantly different from the low levels in the medial amygdala (4.5 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg) and in the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (5.4 +/- 1.1 fmol/mg) of EB-treated females. However, EB caused a significant induction over baseline levels not only in the arcuate-median eminence, periventricular area, and medial preoptic area, but also in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and the anterior hypothalamic nucleus.

Between 1500-1600 h on the day of progesterone (or blank capsule) implantation, these rats, a group of unoperated or sham controls, and a group of estrogen-progesterone-treated immature male rats were killed and perfused, and their brains processed for immunocytochemistry of c-fos antigen and LHRH. LHRH neurons consistently expressed c-fos after estrogen-progesterone treatment in females but not males; in only one of four females examined was c-fos induced after estrogen treatment. No fos was associated with LHRH neurons in the control groups. The LHRH neurons that expressed c-fos were located in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus; more rostral LHRH cells did not appear stimulated. These data demonstrate that gonadal steroids, administered in a paradigm that predictably produces timed stimulation of LH release, induce c-fos in LHRH neurons.

Long term treatment with reserpine in vivo, which causes hypotension and increased splanchnic nerve activity, induced prolonged increases in the abundance of NPY mRNA and putative NPY pre-mRNA, with concomitant increases in NPY, in the adrenal gland in a tissue-dependent manner but caused no changes in the abundance of beta-actin mRNA. Transection of the splanchnic nerves almost completely (76%) prevented the reserpine-induced increases in the abundance of NPY mRNA and NPY pre-mRNA, but denervation alone did not affect their steady state levels. These results suggested that increased activity of the splanchnic nerves regulates NPY gene expression positively in the adrenal gland, probably at the level of transcription. In PC12 cells, reserpine decreased the abundance of NPY mRNA directly, but nicotinic receptor activation increased its abundance transiently and the persistent membrane depolarization increased its abundance markedly. Thus, NPY gene expression is positively regulated by membrane depolarization via increased transsynaptic activation with reserpine.", "PMC2234468": "The morphological features of early gastric carcinoma and its differences with respect to advanced gastric cancer are discussed on the basis of reported data.

The findings in the majority of MGCs were identical with those in OCs, suggesting that they most probably derived from the same precursor. Continuous in vitro culture revealed two kinds of MGCs, which were designated preliminarily as short-lived MGCs and long-lived MGCs for their difference in morphology and in several biological features, which suggests two kinds of MGCs exist in GCT.

For this purpose, cells from an antigen-specific T helper cell line were treated with cyclosporin A (CSA). The stimulation of CSA-treated T cells with specific antigen in the presence of low concentrations of CSA, demonstrated that the T cells did not release detectable levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, and interleukin-5. When such CSA-treated T cells interacted with hapten-specific B cells in the presence of specific antigen, the B cells were found to develop responsiveness to exogenously added growth and differentiation inducing soluble mediators. The development of lymphokine responsiveness in such cultures could be partially blocked by the addition of a monoclonal antibody specific for major histocompatibility complex class II molecules expressed on the B cell surfaces. These results indicated that antigen-mediated interaction between B and T cells, in the absence of lymphokines, resulted in a phenotypic change in B cell behavior and suggested that the signal that promoted this change occurred as a consequence of the T cell antigen receptor binding to B cell surface Ia in association with processed antigen.

It was also shown that proteins with free NH2-terminal alpha-NH2 groups bind better to this site than proteins with blocked NH2 termini (Hershko, A., Heller, H., Eytan, E., and Reiss, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11992-11999). In the present study, we used simple derivatives of amino acids, such as methyl esters, hydroxamates, or dipeptides, to examine the question of whether the protein binding site of the ligase is able to distinguish between different NH2-terminal residues of proteins. Based on specific patterns of inhibition of the binding to ligase by these derivatives, three types of protein substrates could be distinguished. Type I substrates are proteins that have a basic NH2-terminal residue (such as ribonuclease and lysozyme); these are specifically inhibited by derivatives of the 3 basic amino acids (His, Arg, and Lys) with respect to degradation, ligation to ubiquitin, and binding to ligase. Type II substrates (such as beta-lactoglobulin or pepsinogen, that have a Leu residue at the NH2 terminus) are not affected by the above compounds, but are specifically inhibited by derivatives of bulky hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Trp, Phe, and Tyr). In these cases, the amino acid derivatives apparently act as specific inhibitors of the binding of the NH2-terminal residue of proteins, as indicated by the following observations: (a) derivatives in which the alpha-NH2 group is blocked were inactive and (b) in dipeptides, the inhibitory amino acid residue had to be at the NH2-terminal position. An additional class (Type III) of substrates comprises proteins that have neither basic nor bulky hydrophobic NH2-terminal amino acid residues; the binding of these proteins is not inhibited by homologous amino acid derivatives that have NH2-terminal residues similar to that of the protein. It is concluded that Type I and Type II proteins bind to distinct and separate subsites of the ligase, specific for basic or bulky hydrophobic NH2-terminal residues, respectively. On the other hand, Type III proteins apparently predominantly interact with the ligase at regions of the protein molecule other than the NH2-terminal residue.", "PMC2557044": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) may contribute to tissue destruction in rheumatoid arthritis, in part, by inducing messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes interstitial collagenase. In human synovial fibroblasts in vitro, IL-1 induced collagenase mRNA accumulation 6 hours after being added to the cells. High levels of mRNA remained present for at least 48 hours after treatment. The rate of transcription of collagenase in isolated nuclei peaked after approximately 6 hours of treatment with IL-1 and declined thereafter, becoming nearly undetectable by 24 hours. The persistence of mRNA, in view of the transient peak of transcription, suggested that collagenase mRNA was stable in synovial fibroblasts. The half-life of collagenase mRNA after the synoviocytes were treated with actinomycin D was approximately 27 hours, both in the presence and in the absence of IL-1. It has been noted that induction of the expression of collagenase by phorbol esters requires fos protein synthesis and is mediated through a tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate response element in the 5'-flanking region of the gene. However, we found that cycloheximide, when added to synovial fibroblast cultures up to 6 hours after treatment with IL-1, inhibited the expression of collagenase mRNA. These results suggest that fos alone is unlikely to be sufficient for collagenase expression, and that additional factors, or alternative pathways, are involved in the induction of collagenase by IL-1.", "PMC2820376": "The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was shown to mimic luteinizing hormone (LH; lutropin) in causing desensitization of LH-mediated cyclic AMP production in tumour Leydig cells. However, there were differences between LH- and TPA-induced desensitization: (1) TPA induced a more rapid effect than LH; (2) adenosine did not inhibit TPA-induced desensitization, whereas it completely inhibited the LH-induced desensitization; (3) adenylate cyclase activity in plasma membranes from TPA-desensitized cells was not decreased, whereas similar preparations from LH-desensitized cells lost their response to LH and to LH plus guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate; TPA-, but not LH-, treated cells had a decreased capacity to respond to cholera toxin and forskolin. These results indicate that LH and phorbol esters induce desensitization of adenylate cyclase in rat tumour Leydig cells by different mechanisms.", "PMC2643527": "This paper attempts an update and comment upon some of the topics of chromosome aberration formation which Lea raised in Chapter VI of his classic work 'Actions of Radiations on living Cells'.

In commenting upon these topics, pertinent references are made to work with mammalian and human cells. Increased knowledge of the importance of DNA as a fundamental target and the integral part it plays in the complex structure of the chromosome, coupled with cellular techniques not available to these earlier workers necessitate some revision and modification of early ideas.

Glucose transport was measured in muscles by evaluating the fractional efflux (lambda, min-1) of [14C]3-O-methylglucose (14C-3MG) after \"loading\" muscles with 14C-3MG. Basal glucose transport was similar in muscles from 8-hr bacteremic (B) and time-matched control (C) rats, but it was elevated significantly in muscles 12 hr after bacterial injection (B lambda = 0.0227 +/- 0.0010, n = 41, C lambda = 0.0159 +/- 0.0008, n = 42; P less than .05). The effect of insulin on transport was determined from the peak response and from the percent increase in transport for each insulin dose. At low insulin concentrations, peak glucose transport was increased in muscles from 8-hr bacteremic rats compared to controls, while the response to 10.0 mU/ml of insulin was similar in bacteremic and control rat muscles. The maximum percent increase in transport and the EC50 for insulin-mediated 3MG transport were not different in muscles from 8-hr bacteremic and time-matched control rats. Twelve hr after bacterial injection, low insulin doses stimulated sugar transport to greater peak values in bacteremic rat muscles compared to time-matched control values. However, peak 14C-3MG transport with 10.0 mU/ml of insulin was attenuated in bacteremic rat muscles compared to controls. An attenuated maximum response and slightly diminished EC50 were evident in muscles from 12-hr bacteremic rats compared to controls when the percent increase in transport at each insulin concentration was analyzed. The results of the current study were similar to results obtained in fasted rats [1] which indicates that alterations in muscle glucose transport during bacteremia are independent of dietary state.", "PMC2109030": "Mouse plasma from strains C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ includes a high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction containing apolipoprotein A-I which migrates in the prebeta region upon agarose gel electrophoresis, similar to the prebeta HDL previously reported in humans. This prebeta A-I lipoprotein species has a buoyant density of 1.080-1.210 g/ml and has two molecular weight species, 65,000 and 71,000. It is lipid-poor and deficient in apolipoprotein E. When mice are fed a high fat and high cholesterol diet, the quantity of prebeta A-I increases in both strains as determined by quantitative densitometry of agarose gel immunoblots. Prebeta A-I species are highly unstable in plasma at 37 degrees C. Initially (0-1 h) levels decreased and with further incubation (1-8 h) levels increased. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) demonstrated that the prebeta HDL formed during prolonged incubation (1-8 h) was identical in size to HDL in unincubated samples. The initial decrease of prebeta HDL observed during the first hour of incubation, phase I, was inhibited by DTNB, suggesting that phase I is dependent on lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT); however, the subsequent increase, phase II, was unaffected by DTNB and appears LCAT-independent. The prebeta A-I species formed in plasma containing DTNB after a 4-h incubation resulted in a polydisperse particle size distribution. The two strains, the atherosclerosis-susceptible C57BL/6 and -resistant C3H, displayed a similar elevation and induction of prebeta HDL during a dietary switch from laboratory chow to an atherogenic diet with a transient peak occurring at 7 days even when total HDL in the susceptible strain was greatly reduced.", "PMC2894450": "A simple and sensitive assay for quantitating 9-methyl-3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (1; BMY 26517) in human plasma was developed using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.

The reagents employed detect the following blood-group specificities: A (all variants), B, H (type 2), Lewisa, Lewisb, X (Lewisx), Y (Lewisy) and type 1 precursor chain. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that these antigens are differentially expressed in various cell types and developmental stages of the human gastrointestinal tract. ABH expression undergoes developmental modulation in the human colorectal tract from positive to negative during embryogenesis, and is lost in adult cells. Colorectal tumors exhibit neosynthesis of ABH specificities that appear in tumor cells, and accumulation of the precursor antigens. They also show increased expression of Lewis antigens, especially Y determinant, which has a restricted pattern of distribution in normal tissues and is not found in normal colonic mucosa. Enhancement of the Lewis antigens is observed in all colorectal tumors analyzed, regardless of blood-group type and secretory status of the individuals studied. Tumor modulation of these antigens may be related to activation of suppressed genes and enhancement of fucosyltransferases.", "PMC2217139": "The amino acid residues on a protein surface play a key role in interaction with other molecules, determined many physical properties, and constrain the structure of the folded protein. A database of monomeric protein crystal structures was used to teach computer-simulated neural networks rules for predicting surface exposure from local sequence. These trained networks are able to correctly predict surface exposure for 72% of residues in a testing set using a binary model, (buried/exposed) and for 54% of residues using a ternary model (buried/intermediate/exposed). In the ternary model, only 11% of the exposed residues are predicted as buried and only 5% of the buried residues are predicted as exposed. Also, since the networks are able to predict exposure with a quantitative confidence estimate, it is possible to assign exposure for over half of the residues in a binary model with greater than 80% accuracy. Even more accurate predictions are obtained by making a consensus prediction of exposure for a homologous family. The effect of the local environment of an amino acid on its accessibility, though smaller than expected, is significant and accounts for the higher success rate of prediction than obtained with previously used criteria. In the absence of a three-dimensional structure, the ability to predict surface accessibility of amino acids directly from the sequence is a valuable tool in choosing sites of chemical modification or specific mutations and in studies of molecular interaction.", "PMC2847164": "To understand the mechanisms of oncogenesis by human T-cell leukemia virus type I, we have investigated the ability of the tax1, protein to modulate transcription of protooncogenes. By using a transient cotransfection assay, we report that the protooncogene fos promoter is transactivated by tax1 in a variety of cell types. Two regions containing upstream sequences between positions -362/-324 and -323/-276 of the c-fos promoter responded to this activation and also conferred tax1 responsiveness to the heterologous herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter. These two sequences include elements mediating the induction by v-sis-conditioned medium and serum, phorbol ester, or epidermal growth factor, respectively.

Approximately 14 percent of all patients with these disorders had elevated PAIgM but normal levels of PAIgG. Of patients with classic autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there was a trend toward more frequently normal levels of PAIgG in chronic ITP compared with patients with acute ITP, but this was not statistically significant. Patients with acute ITP had higher levels of PAIgG and PAIgM in general than those with chronic ITP. Patterns of PAIgG and/or PAIgM elevation were not significantly different when chronic and acute ITP were compared, nor when childhood ITP was compared with adult ITP. Patients with immune thrombocytopenias owing to malignant disorders were likely to have lower levels of PAIgG compared with those with classic ITP. Treated patients with immune thrombocytopenias showed a trend toward earlier response to therapy if they had only elevated PAIgG as opposed to elevated PAIgM alone or elevated PAIgM and PAIgG (p = 0.17). There appear to be great overlaps in the patterns and quantities of PAIgG and PAIgM in patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenias in widely varied clinical settings. This suggests some underlying common pathophysiologic mechanisms for thrombocytopenia in these clinically diverse disorders. It is believed that the data are most consistent with the hypothesis that thrombocytopenia in patients with elevated PAIgG and/or PAIgM is most probably of immune origin even in such diverse disorders as systemic lupus erythematosus, cirrhosis of the liver, lymphoma, leukemia, cancer, or septic conditions, as well as in ITP.", "PMC3946659": "Three cases are described in which digitalis intoxication was misdiagnosed as depression by primary care physicians.

The value of radiotherapy is discussed, reviewing retrospectively the treatment results obtained in 41 patients irradiated for orbital NHL between 1958 and 1966. All were histologically verified.

Among the 17 remaining patients, 15 cases had been classified as reticulum cell sarcoma and two as lymphosarcoma. Fourteen cases were in stage IE, 19 in stage IIE, and eight in stage IIIE/IVE. After surgical biopsy (n = 25) or resection (n = 5), megavoltage irradiation was delivered in conventional fractionation from 20 Gy up to a total dose of 50 Gy. During the last decade treatment has been based on CT scans and corresponding computer assisted treatment planning. Clinically, complete remission was achieved in 13 out of 14 patients (93%) with stage IE, in 17 out of 19 patients (90%) with stage IIE, and in five out of eight patients (63%) with stage IIIE/IVE. The nonrecurrence rate is 65% (10 out of 14) for stage IE and 75% (13 out of 17) for stage IIE after a mean follow-up time of 36 months. As regards lymphomas of low and high malignancy, the nonrecurrence rate is 89% and 43% respectively.

In this study, first, the presence of specific 3H-atipamezole binding sites in the sagittal and coronal sections of mouse brain was established using autoradiography. In vitro experiments with mouse cerebral cortex membranes indicated that d-medetomidine, a new alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist structurally related to atipamezole, displaces labelled atipamezole more potently than noradrenaline. The saturation isotherm with d-medetomidine demonstrated high affinity binding with the apparent number of binding sites KD 1.36 nM and 760 fmol/mg, respectively. In the next series of experiments male mice were sacrificed immediately after copulation and cerebral cortex 3H-atipamezole and 3H-flumazenil binding was studied. Oxymetazoline and prazosin are known to label preferably alpha 2A and alpha 2B subtypes of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Therefore, parallelly with noradrenaline both these compounds were used to determine non-specific binding of 3H-atipamezole. When noradrenaline or oxymetazoline were used as displacing agents copulation caused a significant increase of 3H-atipamezole binding sites. No significant changes were observed when prazosin was used. 3H-Flumazenil binding remained unchanged by copulation. The up-regulation of 3H-atipamezole binding sites indicates that not only alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the periphery but also in the CNS may participate in the regulation of sexual behavior. Moreover, in regulation of sexual behavior central alpha 2-adrenoceptors may be more important than benzodiazepine receptors.", "PMC2841283": "Proteus mirabilis, a cause of serious urinary tract infection, produces urease, an important virulence factor for this species. The enzyme hydrolyzes urea to CO2 and NH3, which initiates struvite or apatite stone formation.

We examined 76 tumors from 69 patients between the ages of 8 months and 19 years (average age, 8 years). The female-to-male ratio was 3:1. We noted a predilection for the head and neck region, as has also been reported by other investigators. Sixty-nine tumors were examples of typical or classic pilomatrixoma; four of them showed the unusual histologic feature of transepidermal elimination or perforation. None of the tumors in the typical category recurred during a follow-up period that averaged 8.7 years. Seven of the lesions with atypical histologic features were examples of aggressive pilomatrixoma (three cases) and pilomatrical carcinoma (four cases). The average age of these seven patients was similar to that of the overall group. The pilomatrical carcinomas were characterized by invasive nests of tumor cells with irregular borders, large vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, multiple mitotic figures, and focal necrosis. A desmoplastic stroma surrounded the infiltrating nests of tumor. Two of the four pilomatrical carcinomas recurred 2 and 6 months, respectively, after initial excision. The aggressive pilomatrixomas had a similar infiltrative growth pattern, but they did not exhibit the same degree of worrisome cytologic features.

In human peripheral blood, GL183-reactive cells ranged between 2 and 12% (mean 6.5%) in 10 different donors. Double fluorescence and FACS analysis showed that GL183+ cells were consistently included in the CD56+ or CD16+ cell populations. Moreover, since only a fraction of CD56+ or CD16+ cells (approximately 40%) coexpressed GL183 surface antigen, reactivity with GL183 mAb appears to define two subsets within the CD3- lymphocyte population expressing NK cell markers. Although, the majority of GL183+ cells were CD3-, approximately 1% expressed CD3 surface antigens. As shown by clonal analysis, these infrequent CD3+GL183+ cells coexpressed CD56 and CD16 antigens. Cloning of CD3-GL183+ or CD3-GL183- cell populations under limiting dilution conditions yielded clonal progenies that maintained their original surface phenotype. Therefore, expression or lack of expression of GL183 surface antigens represents a stable phenotypic property of a subset of human CD3- NK cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments and two-dimensional PAGE analysis indicated that GL183-reactive molecules were represented in different clones either by a single 58-kD chain or, more frequently, by two chains of approximately 55 and approximately 58 kD, respectively. Analysis of GL183+ or GL183- NK clones for their ability to lyse human (IGROV I) or murine (P815) tumor target cells indicated that GL183- clones were, on average, fivefold more efficient in inducing target cell lysis. GL183+ and GL183- clones produced comparable levels of TNF-alpha in response to PHA plus PMA or anti-CD16 mAb plus PMA. Importantly, production of TNF-alpha was also induced by stimulation of GL183+ clones with GL183 mAb plus PMA. These data indicated that GL183 antigen could mediate cell triggering. This concept was confirmed by the analysis of Ca2+ mobilization, as GL183 mAb induced (in GL183+ clones) increments of [Ca2+]i comparable with those induced by PHA. Moreover, GL183 mAb, or its F(ab')2 fragments, strongly enhanced the cytolytic activity of GL183+ clones against a panel of human tumor target cells, including U937, Raji, IGROV I, M14, and A549. In contrast, GL183 mAb, but not the F(ab')2 fragments, sharply inhibited the cytolytic activity of the same clones against P815, M12, and P3U1 murine target cells.

These substances increased, in a concentration-dependent manner, prolactin release from primary cultures of anterior pituitary cells. Similarly, exposure of pituitary cells to phospholipase C, which liberates endogenous DG from various substrates, also enhanced prolactin release. The effect of Ca2+ mobilization on PMA-, synthetic DG- or phospholipase C-induced prolactin release was examined. A23187 at 400 nM or 2 ng/ml maitotoxin, a Ca2+ channel activator, did not affect prolactin release by themselves, but enhanced the release of prolactin induced by DG, PMA or phospholipase C. The stimulatory effects of DG, PMA and phospholipase C on prolactin release were reduced by co-incubation with dopamine. These results suggest that the presumed activation of protein kinase C by DG and mobilization of Ca2+ may be synergistically involved in the regulation of prolactin release. Dopamine appears to inhibit prolactin release at a point distal to the DG-enhanced stimulation of the process.", "PMC2241623": "Five children with hereditary fructose intolerance developed symptoms of neurological impairment. In three of them, neurological involvement was related to the acute hepatic toxicity of fructose (hypoglycemia, abnormal coagulation, cardiovascular collapse); in the other two, such a relationship could not be demonstrated. Neurological impairment is not classic in hereditary fructose intolerance, but its occurrence in the acute phase of the disease is possible and does not constitute an argument against the diagnosis.", "PMC3125764": "The effect of spinal anesthesia with isobaric 0.5% bupivacaine on ventilatory responsiveness to CO2 rebreathing was studied in ten unpremedicated patients. Minute ventilation (VE) at end-tidal PCO2 = 55 mm Hg increased from 18.7 +/- 6.7 L/min (mean +/- SD) to 22.3 +/- 10.1 L/min after induction of spinal anesthesia (P less than 0.05). Occlusion pressure (P0.1) at PCO2 = 55 mm Hg also increased, from 3.8 +/- 1.5 to 5.0 +/- 1.7 cm H2O (P less than 0.05). Spinal anesthesia was not associated with significant changes in vital capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure, resting end-tidal PCO2, or the slopes or intercepts of the lines relating VE or P0.1 to PCO2. These results show an increased ventilatory responsiveness to CO2 with bupivacaine spinal anesthesia.", "PMC2136737": "Addition of ATP or ATP analog to the incubation media is shown to result in cell death in experiments with different cultured cell lines as evidenced by the results of several independent assays, both in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+. Cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone itself was not only resistant to cytolytic effects of ATP, but was able to \"rescue\" antigen-nonbearing 51Cr-labeled cells from lytic effects of extracellular ATP (but not from lytic effects of adenosine 5'-thiotriphosphate) when present during assay. To test whether the resistance of CTL to ATP is due to a high activity of ecto-ATPase, four independent assays of ATPase activity were utilized to demonstrate the presence and relatively high activity of the ecto-ATPase(s) on CTL surface. Studies of substrate specificity of CTL ecto-ATPase suggest that there is more than one nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase on the surface of CTL. The enzyme(s) activity is Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent and in this respect is similar to recently described hepatic cells ecto-ATPase. We tested effects of known ATP-binding site-specific reagents fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC) and 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) to find covalent modification procedures to be used in studies of functional role of ecto-ATPase. FSBA, but not FITC, inhibits lymphocyte ecto-ATPase but addition of ATP together with FSBA protects ecto-ATPase activity. Inactivation of CTL ecto-ATPase by pretreatment with FSBA makes CTL susceptible to lytic effects of extracellular ATP, as was hypothesized for the functional role of this enzyme in CTL.", "PMC3989650": "Psychologists in juvenile forensic psychological clinics were surveyed about usage of the TAT. A clear majority uses the TAT as part of their assessment battery, the majority using between six and ten cards. Administration and scoring methods were examined. Selection of cards was harmonious with prior research on theme productivity. Many respondents were found not to use the TAT because of time constraints, a finding discussed in terms of appropriate standards of care. Additional research needs to establish representative as well as expected standards of ethical practice for the TAT among general clinical groups, both adult and adolescent.", "PMC4009841": "Fifty-four patients underwent 56 profundaplasties for limb salvage. All had stenosis greater than 50% in diameter of the deep femoral artery and associated superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. After profundaplasty, ischemic ulcers healed in 9 of 17 (53%) patients. Rest pain was relieved in 6 of 19 (32%) and areas of ischemic necrosis healed in 7 of 20 (35%). Cumulative patency of the deep femoral artery was 49% at 3 years but fell to 21% at 5 years, whereas cumulative limb salvage was 49% and 36%, respectively. Eleven of the required 28 amputations were performed in the immediate postoperative period. Profundaplasty was used to lower the amputation level and preserve the knee joint in six patients. The other five early amputations occurred in severely ischemic limbs without distal vessels suitable for bypass. The profundaplasty remained patent in all 19 patients who underwent below-knee amputation and 16 (84%) became ambulatory with a prosthesis. Hemodynamic data provided by determination of the profundapopliteal collateral index predicted limb salvage in 10 of 11 (91%) of limbs when the index value was less than or equal to 0.19. Other clinical criteria, such as preoperative ankle-brachial index and the presence of diabetes mellitus, had no predictive value. Isolated profundaplasty for limb salvage is an effective first procedure for selected patients and provides a reasonable alternative to primary amputation or high-risk distal bypass. When amputation is inevitable, effective perfusion of the profunda femoris artery is essential for preservation of the knee joint and results in a high degree of functional rehabilitation.", "PMC5339843": "The incidence of Clostridium botulinum organisms was determined in a variety of plastic-packaged \"vulnerable\" foods (food requiring little or no heating prior to consumption). A total of 113 foods were examined by use of an enrichment recovery procedure followed by toxin testing in animals. Results of the survey indicate that the incidence of C. botulinum organisms in these vulnerable foods is extremely low. The ability of inoculated food products to support growth and toxigenesis of C. botulinum type E was then tested. The 64 packaged foods were inoculated with type E spores and incubated anaerobically at 30 C for 11 days. A slurry of each food was prepared, smears for fluorescent-antibody testing were made, and animal tests were performed for toxin. If the animal tests were negative, enrichment cultures were prepared from the slurry and incubated at 30 C. On direct examination of the slurries for toxin, only samples of turkey roll and soybean cake supported growth and toxigenesis by C. botulinum type E. However, the enrichment culture method was able to induce growth and toxin production in 60 of the remaining 62 samples.", "PMC2141709": "Surgical techniques for male reconstruction of ambiguous genitalia are the same used for treatment of severe hypospadias, preceded, if necessary, by hormonal stimulation for penile growth. To obtain female reconstruction, many techniques concerning both clitoroplasty and vaginoplasty, have been proposed. Not all treatments get satisfactory functional and aesthetic results. We describe a technique, which can be followed whenever vagina ends up distally to urethral sphincter and includes useful peculiarities of techniques described by some Authors. This operation allows in one time precocious correction of genital malformation; in the 10 patients we treated, good aesthetic and functional results were obtained.", "PMC2106831": "In order to determine the mechanism for the effects of homofolates on growth of Lactobacillus casei, polyglutamated derivatives of homofolate (HPteGlu), dihydrohomofolate and tetrahydrohomofolate (H4HPteGlu) were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of folate-requiring enzymes. The following L. casei enzymes were examined: thymidylate synthase (TS), glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, serine hydroxymethyltransferase and dihydrofolate reductase. Polyglutamates of (6R,S)-H4HPteGlu are potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. For example, the IC50 values of (6R,S)-H4HPteGlu6 are 0.7 microM for TS and 0.3 microM for GARFT. By contrast, the value for HPteGlu6 is greater than 10 microM for both TS and GARFT. Inhibition of TS and GARFT by (6R,S)-H4HPteGlu derivatives increases with polyglutamate chain length. For TS, the Glu5 and Glu6 derivatives of (6R,S)-H4HPteGlu are 20 and 30 times more potent than the monoglutamate, respectively. For GARFT, the Glu2-6 derivatives are 2-3 times more potent than Glu1. Inhibition of TS and GARFT by (6R,S)-H4HPteGlu polyglutamates is almost entirely due to the unnatural (6R) diastereomer at C-6. Homofolate derivatives are only weak inhibitors of aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and dihydrofolate reductase. We conclude that both TS and GARFT are potential targets of (6R)-H4HPteGlu polyglutamates.", "PMC2148133": "In order to investigate the mechanism of amelioration of metabolic abnormalities with supplementary doses of insulin, islet B-cell function and insulin sensitivity were measured in 10 patients with Type 2 diabetes in secondary failure to oral agents. A small dose of ultralente insulin (0.26 +/- 0.07 U kg-ideal-body-weight-1) was added in the morning before breakfast. After 3 months insulin therapy and progressive improvement of metabolic control (HbA1 from 10.5 +/- 0.4 to 9.0 +/- 0.3% at the end of insulin treatment, p less than 0.001), basal C-peptide and incremental area during an oral glucose tolerance test were unchanged. In vivo peripheral insulin sensitivity (euglycaemic clamp with insulin infusion of 40, 160, and 600 mU m-2 min-1, respectively) was significantly improved (glucose requirement: to 4.7 +/- 1.0 from 3.0 +/- 0.6 mg kg-1 min-1, p less than 0.05 at first insulin level; to 10.8 +/- 0.5 from 9.3 +/- 0.7 mg kg-1 min-1, p less than 0.01 at second level; to 13.3 +/- 0.6 from 11.8 +/- 0.8 mg kg-1 min-1, p less than 0.025 at third level). Basal hepatic glucose production was also significantly reduced (from 4.3 +/- 0.4 to 3.3 +/- 0.3 mg kg-1 min-1, p less than 0.05), and residual glucose production further suppressed after insulin supplement (from 1.1 +/- 0.4 to 0.3 +/- 0.2 mg kg-1 min-1 after 120 min at 100 mU l-1 plasma insulin, p less than 0.05). Specific insulin binding to mononuclear leucocytes was unchanged (from 3.1 +/- 0.3 to 3.5 +/- 0.3%, NS).", "PMC3349424": "Morphologic parameters were correlated with survival in 121 renal cortical neoplasms including 116 carcinomas and five oncocytomas. An increasing nuclear grade was generally correlated with a significant decrease in disease-free survival although no statistical difference was found between nuclear Grade 1 and 2 tumors. Similarly, a higher stage at diagnosis predicted a shorter disease-free survival. Renal vein invasion adversely affected prognosis only for high nuclear grade carcinomas. Papillary and spindled carcinomas, independent of nuclear grade, were associated with a significant decrease in disease-free survival compared to tumors with a solid pattern. Patients with large neoplasms (greater than 10 cm) had a significantly worse disease-free survival than patients with tumors 10 cm or less. The prognostic significance of tumor cell type is less clear. Patients with oncocytomas had the best disease-free survival compared with patients with tumors of other cell types. However, the difference in survival was not statistically significant for low-grade tumors, suggesting that nuclear grade rather than cell type may be the more important determinant.", "PMC4618455": "The product of beta-lactamase activity (a penicilloic acid in the case of a penicillin) is stoichiometrically oxidized by iodine. Hence, the beta-lactamase activity can be measured as decolorization of the blue starch-iodine complex. Since the decolorization is a slow process, the rate of decolorization gave an underestimate of the rate of penicillin hydrolysis until a steady state was obtained after 15 to 20 min. If the reaction mixture (3 ml) contained no more than 0.001 unit of enzyme, a correct determination of beta-lactamase activity was obtained from the microiodometric method described. The method is sensitive and some applications are mentioned.", "PMC2195257": "A multitude of antimicrobial agents have become available over the past two decades. Appropriate use of these drugs demands not only an understanding of the antimicrobial spectrum of the agent but of the necessary dose adjustments because of renal or hepatic impairment.

The peroxidatic oxidation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2 was examined spectrophotometrically and the reactivity of the spectral species were compared to those formed from the peroxidative oxidation of benzidine. 2. The horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine yielded two transient and one stable spectral species with absorption maxima at 630 nm, 370 nm and 410 nm, respectively, whereas that of benzidine yielded three stable spectral species with absorption maxima at 610 nm, 425 nm and 370 nm, respectively. 3. The 425 nm species from benzidine, but not the 410 nm species from 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine was scavenged by butylated hydroxyanisole, glutathione, N-acetylcysteine or 2-deoxyguanosine. 4. H.p.l.c. mass spectrometric analysis, and comparative studies with potassium dichromate oxidation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, indicated that the major product from the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is azo-3,3'-dichlorobenzidine. 5. None of the products from enzymic or chemical oxidation of either 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine or benzidine was directly mutagenic to S. typhimurium TA98 in the Ames test; however the chemically oxidized and enzymic products from 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine were mutagenic in the presence of H2O2. 6. The data indicate that despite apparent structural similarities between the intermediates formed during the peroxidatic oxidation of all benzidines, the intermediates and products of peroxidatic oxidation of dichlorobenzidine have reactivities and stabilities different from those of other benzidines.", "PMC4052016": "Low concentrations of beta-bungarotoxin or bee-venom phospholipase A2 cause a progressive Ca2+-dependent increase in the proton permeability of the mitochondria within the synaptosomal cytosol, manifested as an increase in oligomycin-insensitive respiration and a partial depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This uncoupling appears to be a consequence of fatty acids liberated by phospholipase A2 activity at the plasma membrane, since it can be mimicked by the addition of oleate-albumin complexes, in which case there is no requirement for external Ca2+. Dendrotoxin does not affect the mitochondrial proton permeability in situ, but protects partially against the uncoupling action of beta-bungarotoxin. In contrast, this effect of bee-venom phospholipase A2 is unaffected by dendrotoxin. beta-Bungarotoxin, but not bee-venom phospholipase A2, induces a slow progressive depolarization of the plasma membrane. The action of beta-bungarotoxin at the plasma membrane appears not to be related to fatty acid production, since it is augmented rather than inhibited by raising albumin concentrations in the medium. It is concluded that beta-bungarotoxin has at least two actions on intact synaptosomes, both of which may involve interaction at the plasma membrane with a site common to dendrotoxin: first, a mitochondrial uncoupling mediated by fatty acids and, secondly, a depolarization at the plasma membrane.", "PMC3040723": "We exposed simian virus 40-infected CV-1 monkey cells to the carcinogen N-acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene and monitored the removal of lesions from cellular DNA and from various regions of viral DNA. Exposure to 5.5 microM 3H-labeled carcinogen produced 20-80 adducts per 10(6) bases in cellular DNA in different experiments. The initial adduct concentration in viral DNA was always approximately half that in cellular DNA. At various times after treatment, cellular and viral DNA, and restriction fragments of viral DNA, were purified and examined for adduct density. Independent of the initial adduct concentration three rates of repair were observed. Cellular DNA was repaired at the lowest rate. Viral DNA was repaired about 50% more rapidly than was cellular DNA isolated from the same carcinogen-treated monolayers. Within the viral DNA a 366-base pair region containing the major nuclease-hypersensitive site was repaired at twice the rate of the rest of the viral genome. This region contains regulatory sequences that govern the initiation of DNA replication and viral gene expression. As reported previously this region was initially modified 1.71 +/- 0.20-fold higher than expected from its guanine content. Selective repair diminished the extent of hypermodification of this region by 6.0 +/- 2.1% per hour, partly compensating for the higher initial level of adducts.", "PMC2172972": "We studied the function of the human small (46-kDa) mannose 6-phosphate receptor (SMPR) in transfected mouse L cells that do not express the larger insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Cells overexpressing human SMPR were studied for enzyme binding to cell surface receptors, for binding to intracellular receptors in permeabilized cells, and for receptor-mediated endocytosis of recombinant human beta-glucuronidase. Specific binding to human SMPR in permeabilized cells showed a pH optimum between pH 6.0 and pH 6.5. Binding was significant in the presence of EDTA but was enhanced by added divalent cations. Up to 2.3% of the total functional receptor could be detected on the cell surface by enzyme binding. We present experiments showing that at very high levels of overexpression, and at pH 6.5, human SMPR mediated the endocytosis of beta-glucuronidase. At pH 7.5, the rate of endocytosis was only 14% the rate seen at pH 6.5. Cells overexpressing human SMPR also showed reduced secretion of newly synthesized beta-glucuronidase when compared to cells transfected with vector only, suggesting that overexpressed human SMPR can participate in sorting of newly synthesized beta-glucuronidase and partially correct the sorting defect in mouse L cells that do not express the insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor.", "PMC2232402": "A 62-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of massive hemoptysis. Chest X-ray film, CT scan and IADSA demonstrated a large aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, extending from the ascending aorta to the descending aorta. Bronchoscopy revealed bleeding from left B1+2. Six days after the onset, replacement of the thoracic aorta with woven Dacron prosthetic graft, autoclaved after immersion in albumin, was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and separate cerebral perfusion (700 ml/min) under moderate hypothermia (25 degrees C). Left upper lobe of the lung, adherent tightly to the posterior and medial wall of the aneurysm, was not dissected because bleeding from left bronchus was trivial even after systemic heparinization. Because of the cardiac dilatation, delayed chest closure was needed. Postoperative cardiac failure, necessitating much catecholamine support, was seen with gradual improvement and no neurological deficit was recognized. He was discharged from the hospital without any sequelae 2 months after the onset. Pathologic diagnosis was an atherosclerotic aneurysm.", "PMC2106115": "Advanced transcranial lesions may be successfully resected through a variety of contemporary skull base approaches. The identification and isolation of the internal carotid artery throughout its petrous course is essential in most of these surgical techniques. Anatomic landmarks normally used to identify this vital structure, however, may be severely distorted by tumor involvement or previous operative dissection. In an effort to define surgical landmarks that may be used in the identification of the petrous carotid artery, histologic sections of 100 temporal bones from adults were examined and microscopic measurements were recorded from the anatomic dissection of 10 fresh cadaver halfheads. On the basis of these studies, structures we have found useful in identification of the vertical petrous carotid artery during lateral skull base approaches include the: base of the styloid process, bony vascular crest, basal turn of the cochlea, medial wall of the eustachian tube, and the cochleariform process. Identification of the horizontal segment can be achieved by the preliminary delineation of the middle meningeal artery, greater petrosal nerve, tensor tympani muscle, mandibular and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve, and the eustachian tube.

Strong support for this conclusion is given by the analysis of CD data and 1H chemical shift variations with the temperature and the addition of stabilizing (trifluoroethanol) and denaturing (urea) agents. This results gives experimental support to the idea that native isolated secondary structure elements (at least alpha helices) are, as a rule, partially stable in solution and therefore they can act as independent protein-folding nucleation centers.", "PMC2270919": "The majority of hepatic abscesses of biliary tract origin are the result of suppurative or non suppurative cholangitis, caused either by common duct stones, inflammatory stricture or malignancies. We report our experience of 7 consecutive liver abscesses after biliary tract surgery, treated in our surgical unit over a 2-year period, there were 6 females and 1 male with an age of 41 to 83 years. Hepatic abscess after biliary surgery developed from 10 days to 14 months postoperatively. Two patients underwent primary surgical drainage and remained clinically well 6 months and 2 years postoperatively. Five patients initially had percutaneous drainage and 4 of them subsequently underwent operative drainage; one patient declined any further operative treatment after percutaneous drainage and died 8 days later from continuing sepsis. Multiple factors may account for the development of both cholangitis and hepatic abscess following biliary tract procedures. Radiologic investigation should not only focus on the abscess itself but must also identify underlying biliary pathology. Our experience suggests that a surgical approach may be preferable to percutaneous techniques as it allows appropriate management of the associated biliary pathology.", "PMC2435533": "As deferoxamine (DFO) appeared to have certain toxic effects on the sensory pathways in some of our patients on nightly subcutaneous deferoxamine (DFO) for transfusion-dependent anemia, treatment was stopped in all of these patients to obtain a comprehensive baseline assessment of sensory function. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were studied in all patients; the 77 described in this report all had normal ophthalmological examinations. Abnormally prolonged VEP latencies were found in 21%. The patients remained off DFO for 2-6 months, and most of those with abnormal VEPs who were retested showed improvement in their VEPs over this period with the VEPs returning to within normal range in half the cases; two showed no change. Since restarting DFO, VEP latencies in 10 of these patients have increased again beyond normal limits, as have the VEPs in 7 who had previously normal VEPs. Although most of the 77 patients have VEPs that are currently normal and stable while on DFO, a significant sub-group have abnormal VEPs that appear sensitive to the administration of DFO and may reflect a vulnerability to DFO neurotoxicity. These data suggest that the VEPs can detect subclinical toxic effects of DFO on the visual system and should be considered as a monitor for patients receiving chronic DFO therapy.", "PMC2140799": "In order to assess a possible involvement of thyroid hormone in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), experimentally induced hyper- and hypothyroid rats were employed, and the immunoreactive rat ANP (IR-ANP) concentrations in plasma, atria and brain regions including the hypothalamus were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. Plasma IR-ANP concentration in hypothyroid rats was 14.5 +/- 2.9 (mean +/- SD) fmol/ml, significantly lower than that in control rats (p less than 0.05 vs control of 24.9 +/- 9.7 fmol/ml). Plasma IR-ANP concentration in hyperthyroid rats was 66.4 +/- 9.7 fmol/min, significantly higher than that in the controls (p less than 0.01). Atrial IR-ANP concentration in hyperthyroid rats was significantly lower than that in the controls (79.9 +/- 11.1 nmol/g vs 133.5 +/- 21.2 nmol/g (control), p less than 0.05), though no significant change was observed in atrial IR-ANP concentration in hypothyroid rats. While hypothalamic ANP concentration in hypothyroid rats was significantly lower than that in the controls (17.5 +/- 3.5 pmol/g vs 31.9 +/- 1.9 pmol/g (control), p less than 0.05), there was no significant change of that in the hyperthyroid rats. On reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, the major peak in plasma and hypothalamus extract was thought to be identical to synthetic alpha-rat ANP (1-28).

Inside the Escherichia coli transformation host, intramolecular recombination between the homologous ends of the resultant plasmid intermediate completes the integration of the linker.

Subjects who had a minimum of four observations over an 18-year period were selected; the age range at first study was 22-69 years. Individual regression analyses of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), adjusted for height, on age were used in analyses. Subjects with asthma had a greater rate of decline in FEV1 (p less than 0.01) and a lower baseline lung function (p less than 0.001). The mean loss of FEV1 in males of 1.7 m height was 50 ml/year in nonsmokers with asthma compared with 35 ml/year in the normal subjects. The effect of asthma was variable and not all subjects with asthma had steep rates of decline. There were insufficient numbers of smokers with asthma to draw conclusions about an effect of cigarette smoking additional to the effect of asthma. No relationship was found between rate of decline of FEV1 and age or atopic status. In subjects with asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which was measured at the end of the study, accounted for 9% of the variation in rate of decline of FEV1 and airflow limitation, measured by FEV1 FVC, accounted for 10%. Further studies are needed to determine whether the steep rates of decline found in subjects with asthma are preventable.", "PMC4114980": "Thirty-three pigs in three groups of nineteen, ten, and four pigs were infected with three different African swine fever (ASF) virus isolates, respectively. All virus isolates were attenuated to varying degrees by passaging in cell cultures, and they retained sufficiently low virulence to produce subacute and chronic infections in pigs. Sera collected at various intervals were tested for antibody activity by the immunoelectroosmophoresis, agar gel diffusion precipitin, and complement-fixation tests using a modified Kolmer technique. Results clearly indicated that the immunoelectroosmophoresis test is a rapid (30 minute) and accurate method with extreme sensitivity and superior to the complement-fixation and agar gel diffusion precipitin tests in detecting antibody against ASF virus.

Similar numbers of L. monocytogenes were recovered from rIL-1 alpha-treated and control mice at up to 24 h after infection; however, by 48 h after infection more than 1 log10 fewer viable L. monocytogenes were recovered from the spleens of rIL-1 alpha-treated mice than from Listeria-infected controls. The difference in bacterial burden between IL-1 alpha-treated and control mice increased with time; by 7 days after infection viable L. monocytogenes had been eliminated from most rIL-1 alpha-treated mice, whereas control mice still harbored 10(4) to 10(5) L. monocytogenes per spleen and liver. Histopathologic examination confirmed that rIL-1 alpha-treated mice suffered considerably less damage to the spleen, liver, lung, and brain than did control mice. To determine whether rIL-1 alpha-mediated protection indirectly by augmenting the release of other cytokines, we determined serum levels of colony-stimulating activity and IFN activity in rIL-1 alpha-treated and control Listeria-infected mice. Treatment with rIL-alpha elicited an early burst of serum colony-stimulating activity as compared with sera from Listeria-infected control mice. These data suggest that exogenous administration of rIL-1 initiates release of colony-stimulating activity, and perhaps other cytokines, that accelerate the protective response of the infected host. Prophylactic augmentation of antimicrobial resistance by administration of rIL-1 alpha may be worthy of further evaluation.", "PMC2855436": "1. Calcium and sodium currents and non-linear capacitive currents were recorded from isolated ventricular cells from neonatal rats, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, usually with a holding potential of -100 mV. 2. When recording with internal and external solutions designed to suppress virtually all ionic currents except the calcium current, careful subtraction of all linear capacitive and ionic currents revealed that depolarizations elicited a small transient outward current which preceded the inward calcium current. This outward current was discernible just below the threshold potential for the calcium current and increased with larger depolarizations to a maximum for potentials of about +30 mV and above. 3. Elimination of the calcium current revealed that at each potential the transient outward current was accompanied by a roughly equal transient inward current upon repolarization. The properties of these currents indicate that they are non-linear capacitive currents. Best-fit Boltzmann curves of the 'on' charge (integral of the transient outward current) gave values for qmax, V and k of 3.9 nC/microF, -29.3 mV and 15.5 mV with internal Cs+. The maximum 'on' charge is similar to that found with calcium currents (4.3 nC/microF). Similar values were obtained with internal TEA+. 4. Boltzmann fits of conductance vs. voltage for the calcium channel gave mean values of -15.5 and 13.3 mV for V and k (with internal Cs+); the corresponding values for the sodium channel were -49.9 and 5.4 mV. 5. Pre-pulses (20 ms) to -60 mV inactivated 77% of the peak sodium current, but only inactivated about 10% of the peak calcium current and reduced the maximum 'on' charge (moved at potentials positive to -60 mV) by 19%. 6. With a holding potential of -100 mV, 10 microM-nifedipine blocked 89% of the calcium current, but had little effect on the amount of 'on' charge. The 'off' charge appeared to be slower in the presence of nifedipine. 7. These results and consideration of the number of calcium channels and high-affinity binding sites for dihydropyridines (DHP), suggest that a large part of the charge movement may be related to DHP binding sites and involved with gating calcium channels.

The most frequent abnormality was in motility (78%). Teratozoospermia was the second most frequent (28%) and oligozoospermia the third (16%). The 7 patients taking methadone only had neither teratozoospermia nor oligozoospermia. This semen pathology is probably secondary to decreased testosterone production, with relative hypofunction of the seminal tracts and the accessory glands.", "PMC3481330": "Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of ofloxacin were measured in 10 patients on haemodialysis treatment. Serum half-life during the interdialytic interval was 48 hours, and during haemodialysis treatment 10 hours. The decrease in serum concentrations during a 4-hour haemodialysis was 25%. After several doses of ofloxacin, saturation of the tissues and a rediffusion of ofloxacin from the tissues during haemodialysis has to be assumed. This equalizes the rate of elimination, and the serum ofloxacin concentration did not change during the last 2 hours of haemodialysis. The negative influence of phosphate binders on the resorption of ofloxacin can be confirmed. The following ofloxacin dosage regimen is recommended in haemodialysis patients: 200 mg initially, 100 mg loading dose after the first haemodialysis, then 100 mg daily.", "PMC2225779": "Concentration gradients are often used in separations based on chromatographic, electrophoretic and centrifugal methods.

Twenty patients had undergone no change in narcotic dose or type greater than or equal to 7 days (stable dose, SD, group), and 20 patients had undergone an increase of greater than or equal to 30% in dose less than or equal to 3 days before (increased dose, ID, group). Age, primary tumor, type, dose and route of narcotic were not different between the SD and ID group. Cognitive tests (finger tapping, FT, 10 and 30 sec, arithmetic, A, reverse memory of digits, RM, and visual memory, VM) were performed in all patients before and 45 min after their morning dose of narcotics for 2 consecutive days. Mean percentual change in FT 10 sec, FT 30 sec, A, RM, and VM after the narcotic dose were 97 +/- 9%, 100 +/- 14%, 100 +/- 13%, 100 +/- 15%, 98 +/- 19%, in the SD group, vs. 77 +/- 14% (P less than 0.001), 83 +/- 13% (P less than 0.001), 124 +/- 21% (P less than 0.001), 60 +/- 21% (P less than 0.001) and 68 +/- 21% (P less than 0.001) in the ID group, respectively. Our results suggest that patients who undergo a significant increase in the dose of intermittent narcotics experience significant cognitive impairment, that disappears after 1 week of the increase. More research is needed to better characterize the cognitive toxicity of intermittent narcotics, and to determine the cognitive effects of long acting narcotics, continuous infusions, or of the addition of amphetamines.", "PMC3950337": "Na+-dependent binding of 3H-Cocaine is located on dopaminergic terminals and is related to the dopamine uptake system. Studies on senescent rats indicate a decrease in 3H-Cocaine binding density in the striatum. In the same tissue an increase in the Km for dopamine uptake is observed. These changes might be relevant in the age-dependent alterations in dopaminergic function.", "PMC3808309": "A conservative attitude toward unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) has been based on the belief that surgical resection is too risky and that their natural history is benign. We have operated on 103 patients with a cerebral AVM. In the 49 patients with unruptured AVMs, there was no mortality, and the morbidity was 14.2%. Similarly, low surgical morbidity has been reported from several centers during the last few years. The chance of hemorrhage for both ruptured and unruptured AVMs is about 3% per year, and the combined morbidity and mortality of each hemorrhage is at least 40%.

It is shown that this derivative increases the ion permeability of planar lipid membranes as does iturin A. Nevertheless, the global conductance of the doped membrane is very much lower at the same lipopeptide/phospholipid ratio and the ion selectivity is inverted (PK/PCl = 6 instead of 0.6 with iturin A). The characteristics of the induced conducting pores are also rather different. This suggests an important role of the D-Tyr2 residue, present in all the compounds of the iturin family, both in the biological and in the pore-forming properties of iturin A.", "PMC3154474": "1. HLA matching is associated significantly with factors including CsA use, ALS use, recipient race, prior graft loss, presensitization, preservation time and most strongly, with organ sharing. However, HLA match is not directly associated with delayed graft function. 2. By univariate and multivariate analyses, good HLA matching provides significant benefits in graft survival regardless of CsA use, organ source or other potentially confounding factors. 3. HLA-A,B, and DR matching have independent and essentially equivalent benefits on graft survival in CsA-treated patients, whereas HLA-A,B matching has a greater benefit in non-CsA-treated patients. 4. Organ sharing, per se, provides no direct detrimental effect on graft survival by univariate or multivariate analysis. 5. By multivariate and univariate analyses, shared/well-matched kidneys provide significantly better graft survival than local/poorly matched kidneys. 6. Delayed graft function is associated in a complex relationship with organ sharing, prior graft failure, presensitization, and CsA use. 7. The increased rate of delayed graft function associated with organ sharing is overcome by the benefit of good HLA matching. 8. Since April 1986, purposeful organ sharing at SEOPF centers for good HLA matching has been associated with improved graft survival, especially in patients at high risk due to presensitization or prior graft failure.", "PMC3519752": "Localization of cathepsin B in rat kidney was studied using immunocytochemical techniques. Cathepsin B was purified from rat liver and antibody to it was raised in rabbits. The antibody reacted with a lysosomal extract of rat kidney to form a single precipitin line in a double-diffusion test. Immunoblot analysis of lysosomal cathepsin B of rat kidney showed two species of 29K and 25K MW. After removal of Epon, semi-thin sections of glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue were stained by the indirect immunoenzyme technique. Dark-brown reaction product, indicating the antigenic sites for cathepsin B, was found in cytoplasmic granules throughout the nephron. Staining intensity and size of the positive granules varied widely in each segment of the nephron. In the glomeruli and distal tubules, a few small cytoplasmic granules were stained. In the proximal tubules, the S1 segment exhibited many large granules which were most heavily stained, whereas the S2 and S3 segments contained few positive granules. All segments of the distal tubules showed the smallest amount of positive granules. A few positive granules were also noted in the cortical and medullary collecting tubules. Control experiments confirmed the specificity of the staining. The results indicate that the major site for cathepsin B in rat kidney is the S1 segment of the proximal tubule which is known to actively take up proteins leaked through the glomerulus.", "PMC549433": "The metabolism of labelled BOC-14 C-glycine-pentapetide was investigated in rats, both in blood and urine. We report on the following findings: --radioactivity could be measured in the blood even after the disappearance of the bioactive- and immunoreactive pentapeptide. --the bulk of the radioactivity in the blood after 8 minutes originates from a metabolite which, after subsequent systematic chemical identification, proved to be the BOC-14C-glycine fragment of the pentapeptide. --the radioactivity in the urine comes entirely from this split product of the labelled pentapeptide --the organ distribution of radioactivity of labelled pentapeptide was checked after i.v. administration; 1 minute after the injection, most of the radioactivity was found in the liver, followed by the kidney, pancreas, jejunum and lung. After 1 hour, radioactivity could be detected only in the kidneys. It was concluded that the N-terminal amino-acid of the naturally occurring pentagastrin (glycine) remains linked to the BOC protecting group in the course of the catabolism of the molecule and this fragment is excreted in the urine.", "PMC2911386": "The study of developmental patterning has been facilitated by the availability of mutations that produce changes in cell fate, in animals such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We now describe a zygotic lethal mutation in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio, that also changes how particular embryonic cells develop. Severe pattern deficiencies are observed that are restricted to a single body region, the trunk. The mutation may directly affect mesoderm, as somites do not form in the trunk. Head and tail structures, including tail somites, are relatively undisturbed. The earliest detected expression of the mutation is during gastrulation, when movements of mesodermal cells occur incorrectly. We injected prospective trunk mesodermal cells with lineage tracer dye and observed that in mutants these cells may enter a new body region, the tail, and there may express a new fate appropriate for the changed position.", "PMC2136447": "In a 38-year-old patient 17 years previously silicone prostheses of both breasts were implanted.

Frequency distributions and prevalences of birth weight and gestational age differed for those with hemiplegia, diplegia, and quadriplegia. In particular, the children with diplegia showed a bimodal frequency distribution. Children of normal birth weight with diplegia had a higher prevalence of severe mental retardation than those of low birth weight. These differences may be due to survival bias and may not be of aetiological importance. Furthermore, the mothers of diplegic infants had a significantly higher proportion of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and low birthweight infants in their obstetric history. This suggests that prenatal factors predominate in the aetiology of diplegia.", "PMC2224118": "Bleeding after CPB has been difficult to characterize and its treatment equally difficult to standardize. The complexity of this problem is related to the hemostatic process, the technical variations in the operative procedures, and the many uncontrolled variables associated with CPB, including the effects of anesthetic or pharmacologic agents, the nature of the priming solution, hemodilution, hypothermia, the type of oxygenator, and the use of transfused blood products. Although there are multiple and generally predictable complex changes in the hemostatic mechanism during CPB, the temporary loss of platelet function is the most common and clinically relevant. This transient platelet dysfunction occurs in all patients undergoing CPB; however, it only causes excessive bleeding in a small percentage of patients. Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to predict which patients will develop hemorrhagic complications, although prolonged pump times are a contributing risk factor. Over the past decade there has been extensive investigation into the management of bleeding associated with CPB, provoked primarily by the increased awareness of transfusion-transmitted viral diseases and the inappropriately excessive use of homologous blood products. Several approaches to autotransfusion of shed blood and autologus blood donation have been developed to minimize perioperative homologous blood transfusion. Pharmacologic agents such as desmopressin, aprotinin, and topical fibrin glues have also been introduced to improve hemostasis during CPB. The protease inhibitor aprotinin is particularly promising in the reduction of bleeding associated with CPB when given prophylactically. Aprotinin may provide new insights into the mechanism of CPB-induced platelet dysfunction. Desmopressin is indicated only for the treatment of bleeding after CPB. The management of bleeding associated with CPB will undoubtedly", "PMC3034913": "RINm5F cells (an insulin-secreting cell line) were cultured on PSSO3Na microbeads under static conditions. The cell growth rate was either identical to that of cells grown on plastic wells or slower, depending on the initial cell concentration. With both supports, it was similarly influenced by the fetal calf serum concentration in the culture medium, and protein content per cell was identical. However, no spreading was observed when cells were cultured on microbeads. RINm5F cells cultured on plastic wells responded to arginine + theophylline and to leucine + theophylline by a significant increase in insulin secretion. By contrast, in cells cultured on PSSO3Na microbeads, the increase in this secretion was only slight or nil. All these abnormalities were reversible. Thus, when cells cultured on microbeads were detached and seeded on plastic wells, normal spreading and insulin secretion were observed. Lastly, PSSO3Na beads had an acute suppressive effect on insulin secretion by cells cultured on plastic wells. This study provides an example of cell-biomaterial interaction in which cell growth is possible, but with altered cell function.", "PMC2815551": "Five horses with apical and abaxial fractures of the proximal sesamoid bones were treated arthroscopically.

We used two mutant strains of encephalomyocarditis virus (minimally virulent Mengo-37A and a highly virulent Columbia SK [Col-SK]) to investigate these interrelationships. Mice that had been immunized to Mengo-37A, and nonimmunized controls, were challenged with aerosols containing 10(4) plaque-forming units of Mengo-37A or Col-SK per liter. The effect of each viral infection on pulmonary antibacterial activity was assessed 3 days later by measuring the capacity of the lungs to kill inhaled radiophosphorus ((32)P)-labeled Staphylococcus aureus. The degree of antibacterial dysfunction found was proportional to the virulence of the infecting virus. If the host was immune to the infecting virus, bactericidal function was not impaired by viral challenge. Neither mutant caused significant pulmonary damage; therefore: (i) viral-induced impairment in bactericidal activity reflects, quantitatively, the virulence of the virus and (ii) viral immunity protects pulmonary bacterial defenses by preventing damage to the phagocyte from the virus or its attendant metabolic abnormalities.", "PMC3571207": "In the bacterial luciferase reaction, light emission is due to the mixed function oxidation of FMNH2 and long chain aldehydes, which leads to the formation of an electronically excited product species, postulated to be luciferase-bound 4a-hydroxy flavin. In the present work it was found that H2O2 stimulates an additional and kinetically distinct luminescence. The stimulation is more apparent in reactions inhibited by long chain alcohols, and the H2O2 is effective even if added secondarily. The stimulation requires H2O2 only at the outset; its subsequent destruction by catalase does not diminish the response, appreciably.", "PMC3148051": "Forty-one patients who underwent cardiac surgery under conditions of systemic hypothermia and intermittent cold crystalloid potassium cardioplegia were studied, in order to elucidate the effects of ventricular fibrillation and reperfusion on the myocardium, by using the intramyocardial pCO2 and temperature sensor. All patients were assigned to 2 groups, namely; group A (21 cases), in which the time between the aorta declamping and defibrillation was under 10 minutes, and group B (20 cases) in which the time was over 10 minutes. In both groups A and B, myocardial pCO2 increased at the rate of 3.58 +/- 1.70 and 2.16 +/- 0.62 mmHg/min (p less than 0.05) after aorta declamping, respectively and the myocardial pCO2 decreased at the rate of 5.59 +/- 0.60 and 4.18 +/- 0.76 mmHg/min (p less than 0.05) after defibrillation, respectively. In group A, the myocardial calcium content, pre-CPB (cardio pulmonary bypass) was 10.98 +/- 1.62 nmol/mg/dry weight and at the time of aorta declamping it was 15.90 +/- 1.81 nmol/mg/dry weight (p less than 0.05). In group B, the myocardial calcium content, pre-CPB, was 14.62 +/- 2.15 nmol/mg/dry weight and at the time of aorta declamping it was 18.23 +/- 4.36 nmol/mg/dry weight (p less than 0.05). At both three and six hours after the operation, the left ventricular work index per minute (LVWI) in group A showed better cardiac pump function than that in group B.

The fractional catabolic rate of 125I-labeled beta-VLDL was reduced in cholesterol-fed rabbits (0.011 vs 0.139 hr-1), but due to the high endogenous pool, the total beta-VLDL flux was very high (13.1 vs less than 1.1 mg/kg per 24 hr). These results suggest that elevated levels of beta-VLDL during cholesterol feeding were due to an enhanced rate of synthesis, a finding confirmed in hypercholesterolemic rabbits subjected to plasmapheresis. Following acute reduction of plasma cholesterol by plasmapheresis, the quantitative increases in beta-VLDL cholesterol concentrations (210 to 364 mg/dl) over the subsequent 24 hr were in agreement with the rise calculated from the plasma clearance kinetics of 125I-labeled beta-VLDL (378 mg/dl per 24 hr). Aortic accumulation of beta-VLDL in hypercholesterolemic rabbits was increased greater than 15-fold over controls. Accumulation was predominantly in the intimal atheromatous lesions. The fractional catabolic rate of 125I-labeled HDL was increased during cholesterol feeding (0.037 vs 0.021 hr-1). A decreased rate of synthesis appeared to be responsible for the markedly depleted plasma HDL. HDL accumulation within the aorta was attenuated greater than 9-fold in cholesterol-fed rabbits compared to those fed normal chow.

Frame-by-frame analysis and computer-assisted evaluation showed that 80% of the patients with globus symptoms suffered from one or more underlying organic diseases, which could often be treated later with success. We found an increased incidence of early hypopharyngeal diverticula, webs, and motility disorders of the upper esophageal sphincter often associated with gastro-esophageal reflux or weakness of the pharyngeal wall.

Fourteen associated speech and nonspeech behaviors and speech disfluency types were identified and quantified for 10 stutterings from each of the 43 subjects. The 14 associated behaviors and speech disfluency types were further reduced to form three related indices: (a) Sound Prolongation Index, (b) Nonspeech Behavior Index, and (c) Behavioral Variety Index. Results indicated that five subgroups of young stutterers could be identified and described on the basis of these youngsters' number and variety of speech and nonspeech behaviors associated with their stuttering.

These patient were divided into two groups according to the time elapsed between the diagnosis and surgical intervention. We observed that surgical correction within 12 hours following presentation permitted testicular salvage. Testicular volume was generally preserved and remained normal or slightly diminished. However, when the time elapsed was over 12 hours, testicular atrophy was observed in 46% of the patients. We can conclude, therefore, that detorsion must be performed as soon as possible.

In the present work we used the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin2 to study the effect of various cytochalasins, cytochalasins A, B, C, D, E (CA, CB, CC, CD, CE) and dihydrocytochalasin B (dhCB) on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in various types of leukocytes, viz, neutrophils and lymphocytes. In human neutrophils, cytochalasins increase [Ca2+]i mainly by releasing Ca2+ from membrane-bound, intracellular stores. Thus, in order to readily appreciate the effect of cytochalasins on [Ca2+ )i, these cells must be loaded with low intracellular quin2 concentrations. On the other hand, in peripheral blood lymphocytes, splenocytes and thymocytes, the increase in [Ca2+]i is predominantly due to an increased Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium. In addition, we found that in neutrophils these drugs prolong the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by chemotactic peptides, probably by increasing the cell permeability to Ca2+. Finally, in thymocytes, cytochalasins potentiate the production of inositol phosphates induced by the polyclonal mitogen concanavalin A (conA).", "PMC2107685": "In order to provide a detailed description of the MR appearance of intracranial ependymoma, the MR examinations of 12 patients (10 with ependymomas and two with subependymomas) were reviewed and correlated with operative and pathologic reports. Three of 10 ependymomas were intraventricular, two were intraparenchymal, and five were transependymal, extending from CSF spaces into parenchyma. Both subependymomas were intraventricular. Solid ependymomas and subependymomas were iso- to hypointense relative to normal white matter on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on proton-density- and T2-weighted images. Foci of signal heterogeneity within solid neoplasms represented methemoglobin, hemosiderin, necrosis, calcification, and encased native vessels or tumor vascularity. Gd-DTPA-enhanced images in two patients differentiated enhancing tumor from surrounding nonenhancing edema and from surrounding normal brain parenchyma. Cystic neoplasms had sharply defined, round or oval margins and uniform signal intensity equivalent to or slightly hyperintense relative to CSF. Tumor-associated calcification was not demonstrated readily by MR. Sagittal and coronal images were valuable in assessing the amount of intraventricular tumor and route of extension. We conclude that the MR differentiation of ependymomas and subependymomas from other gliomas is provided most reliably by the location and morphology of the tumor and not by differences in signal intensity. The typical ependymoma arises within the fourth ventricle as a solid mass with heterogeneous signal intensity. A propensity for spread is seen along the CSF pathways via the foramina of Magendie and Luschka and the aqueduct of Sylvius. Supratentorial ependymomas may be periventricular in location and have cystic components. The two subependymomas in our series were solid, intraventricular tumors with relatively homogeneous signal intensities.", "PMC3726728": "The relationship between preoperative intravenous pyelogram (IVP) and urologic complications after potentially curative operations for carcinoma of the colon and rectum was studied in 511 patients who underwent operation from 1976 to 1983. Forty per cent of the patients had preoperative IVP and these patients were significantly more likely to have undergone resection distal to the transverse colon than patients without preoperative IVP. Sex, age, urologic history, physical findings, abnormal urinalysis, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine levels and identity of the surgeon did not appear to influence whether or not an IVP was obtained before operation. Postoperative urologic complications were noted in 9.4 per cent of the patients; 87 per cent of the complications were retention or infection. Complications were significantly more common in male patients, particularly those with preoperative symptoms of retention, patients with elevated preoperative BUN or serum creatinine levels and patients who had resections distal to the transverse colon. Age, urologic history, physical findings, abnormal urinalysis results and the identity of the surgeon were not associated with postoperative urologic complications. The incidence of complications was the same in patients with normal and abnormal IVP results as well as for patients who did not undergo IVP. The findings of this study do not support the routine use of preoperative IVP for patients who undergo potentially curative resection for carcinoma of the colon and rectum.", "PMC4133039": "1. alpha-Bungarotoxin was labelled with fluorescent dyes and used as a stain for visualizing the distribution of acetylcholine receptors in vertebrate skeletal muscle fibres.2. Dye-toxin conjugates had the same pharmacological properties as native toxin, but their potencies were lower.3. Fluorescent staining was examined in teased muscle fibres. The stain was found to be confined to the neuromuscular junction and associated with the subsynaptic membrane.4. Staining intensity was reduced by curare and even more so by carbachol, but not by atropine or neostigmine. Pre-treatment of muscles with unlabelled alpha-bungarotoxin entirely prevented staining.5. The staining at amphibian neuromuscular junctions was characterized by a pattern of intense transverse bands occurring at intervals of approximately 0.5-1 mum, with fluorescence of lower intensity between them. Fluorescent staining was not detected on adjacent, extrasynaptic, muscle membrane. In side views the staining appeared as a fine line with small protuberances occurring at the same intervals as the intense bands seen face-on. These results indicate that acetylcholine receptors are associated with the entire subsynaptic membrane, including the membrane of the junctional folds and that their density changes abruptly at the border between synaptic and extrasynaptic muscle membrane.", "PMC3958797": "This study was undertaken to measure the effect of maximal stimulation of sodium pump activity on the rate of energy metabolism in mouse cerebral astrocytes. The rate of uptake of 3H-2-deoxyglucose (3H-2-DG) was measured in astrocyte cultures sodium-loaded either by incubation in a K+-deficient solution or by use of the carboxylic sodium ionophore monensin. Sodium-loading by the first method caused 3H-2-DG uptake to increase by 80%, but the effect was brief (about 5 min) compared with the period of uptake measurement (20 min). In contrast, the presence of monensin (20 microM) caused a sustained 3.4-fold increase in the rate of 3H-2-DG uptake. The concentration-response relationship for monensin indicated a Kd of 1.5 microM and a maximum uptake enhancement of approximately fourfold. The monensin-stimulated uptake of 3H-2-DG was totally inhibited by incubation of the cultures in either K+-free or Na+-free solutions, or in the presence of ouabain (0.4 mM), indicating that the enhancement of uptake was the result of Na+ influx and sodium pump activation. These results raise the possibility that astroglia contribute significantly to regional variations in glucose consumption associated with functional activity in the brain. Ultrastructural analysis showed that sodium-loading in K+-free solution caused swelling confined to the trans face of Golgi stacks. However, monensin (5 microM) caused swelling of the entire Golgi stack, with progressively more severe swelling from cis to trans cisternae and formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2824530": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and acidic FGF are two closely related peptides that are multifunctional. They control proliferation, differentiation, and various other cellular functions in cells derived from the mesoderm and the neuroectoderm. The structural properties, genomic organization, and biological functions of both peptides in vitro or in vivo are reviewed. Their marked ability to enhance formation of connective tissue and vascular capillaries, as well as their involvement in limb regeneration, suggest several possible therapeutic applications.", "PMC2536715": "The tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, causes a rapid, partial redistribution of 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol kinase from the cytosol to the particulate fraction of quiescent, starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. We utilized exogenous dioleoylglycerol as substrate for the kinase. The inactive alpha form of the phorbol ester does not cause any change in diacylglycerol kinase localization, and depletion of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) by chronic administration of phorbol ester blocks the redistribution. Phorbol ester has no direct effect on Swiss 3T3 membrane-bound diacylglycerol kinase nor does it directly effect cytosolic diacylglycerol kinase. When phorbol ester is added to Swiss 3T3 membranes in the presence of ATP, magnesium, and calcium, there is no activation of membrane-bound kinase, indicating that phorbol ester does not activate membrane-bound kinase through phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Reconstitution studies show that the soluble rat brain diacylglycerol kinase binds to diacylglycerol-enriched membranes, produced by treatment of red cell ghosts with phospholipase C or calcium, suggesting that cytosolic diacylglycerol kinase may be capable of translocation to the membrane in response to elevated substrate concentration in the intact cell. Stimulation of the cells with phorbol ester increases the total mass of diacylglycerol. In protein kinase C-depleted cells, addition of a cell-permeable synthetic diacylglycerol, dioctanoylglycerol, results in a partial redistribution of cytosolic diacylglycerol kinase to the membrane, by 5 min, also suggesting that the translocation of diacylglycerol kinase activity is regulated primarily by substrate concentration.", "PMC3056768": "The main purpose of this study was to make an objective assessment of emotional stability as a selection criterion in 14 heart transplant candidates (13 M, 1 F, 45.5 +/- 6.6 years). A psychometric study was conducted using Cognitive Behavioral Assessment (CBA 2.0 Primary-Scale Battery) and the Beck Depression Inventory. The main results of this study were the identification of: a) emotionally unstable patients (42%) who did not respond to the above mentioned selection criterion; b) stable psychological traits such as hostility, aloofness, extroversion as described in type A Behavior Pattern and c) the presence of secondary alexitimic responses suggesting a protective denial of the meaning of the disease. The psychometric method used seems useful in the selection of heart transplant candidates, however, a follow-up can better define the range of emotional stability.", "PMC3170314": "By examination of computerized individual cow records from January 1981 through June 1985, compliance with premarketing drug withdrawal times was investigated in 23 dairy herds. During this period, 877 cows were culled from 23 herds; 33 cows from 12 herds were in violation of premarketing drug withdrawal times. Six herds had 1 violation, 2 herds had 2 violations, 2 herds had 3 and 4 violations, and 2 herds had 7 and 9 violations. Fifty drugs had been used; 15 drugs were used in violation of drug withdrawal times before cows were sent to market. The most commonly used drugs in violation were oxytetracycline, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and a combination of lincomycin/spectinomycin. Significant differences between cows in violation and cows not in violation were not observed for age, lactation number, milk production, herd size, or month of culling. However, the 12 herds in violation of premarket drug withdrawal times had significantly (P less than 0.05) more cows culled within 30 days for retained placenta and milk fever, and more cows culled within 30 and 100 days for mastitis, metritis, and displaced abomasum. Although not significant, the 2 herds with 7 and 9 violations had more hired vs family labor than did the other herds with violations."}
