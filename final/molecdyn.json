{"PMC3501474": "The present study was carried out to investigate the involvement of prostaglandin E (PGE) for mitogenic response and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Mitogenic response and IL-2 production in CD patients were significantly reduced in comparison with the values obtained in healthy donors, the control, (HD, p less than 0.05). Slight increases of mitogenic response and IL-2 production were observed in the presence of indomethacin (IM) in both CD patients and HD, but the differences between the values of them were still significant (p less than 0.05) resulting in less involvement of PGE for the reductions of mitogenic response and IL-2 production in CD patients. Moreover, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) response after addition of IL-2 in CD patients increased remarkably and became equal to that of HD. These results indicate that the reductions of mitogenic response and IL-2 production in CD patients are neither due to the suppression of T cell function by PGE nor the impairment of IL-2 responders.", "PMC3030942": "Facilitation of yolk-sac carcinoma (YSCa) development in fetectomized rats by the Moloney murine sarcoma virus/murine leukemia virus (Mo-MSV/MLV) complex was found to be closely associated with the presence of Mo-MSV sequences in the genomes of the YSCa cells. The virus-induced YSCas consisted of cells of mono- or oligoclonal origin which always contained in their genomes at least I randomly integrated Mo-MSV provirus. In YSCas which developed in the absence of virus, no rearrangement or amplification of c-mos could be detected. In addition, blot hybridization analysis of cellular RNA failed to detect mos-related RNA in cell lines derived from Mo-MSV-induced as well as from non-virally induced YSCas. The methylation level of c-mos DNA was low in all YSCa cell lines. In contrast, v-mos DNA in cell lines derived from Mo-MSV-induced YSCas was heavily methylated.", "PMC2832674": "The effect of L-phenylisopropyladenosine (L-PIA), the A1 adenosine agonist, on the depth of anesthesia was investigated in halothane-anesthetized rats. L-PIA treatment reduced the minimum anesthetic concentration (MAC) of halothane that prevented 50% of animals from moving in response to a painful stimulus by 49%. MAC experiments performed with L-PIA given in conjunction with A1 adenosine receptor antagonists which either permeate the blood-brain barrier (8-phenyltheophylline [8-PT] or do not (8-sulphophenyltheophylline [8-So-PT]) indicate that central mechanisms are involved. Noradrenergic neurotransmission was diminished following L-PIA administration in halothane-anesthetized rats in all brain regions. These data suggest that acute L-PIA treatment decreases central noradrenergic neurotransmission and may represent the mechanism for the decrease in halothane dose to achieve an anesthetic endpoint anesthetic response to halothane.", "PMC3030940": "Peripheral or tonsil lymphocyte populations of EBV-seropositive donors give rise to EBV-carrying LCLs upon in vitro explantation. Such lines can arise either by a 2-step mechanism, namely release of virus from some of the explanted cells followed by infection of previously uninfected B cells, or by direct outgrowth of virus-harboring B cells (Rickinson et al., 1974; Dalens et al., 1975; Hinuma and Katsuki 1978; Katsuki et al., 1979). We observed that cells responsible for both the 2-step mechanism and for direct outgrowth are found in the purified B-cell compartment. Virus release was more frequent than direct outgrowth. The majority of virus-releasing cells were found in the low-density fraction that contains large, activated B blasts. Cells that were capable of spontaneous outgrowth in the presence of the viral inhibitor PFA and of virus-neutralizing antibody gave rise to cell lines that carried the sex chromosome marker of the original donor, rather than that of admixed cord blood lymphocyte of the opposite sex. Such cells were found in both the low- and the high-density fractions. The majority of the EBV-carrying B cells in vivo are thus low-density blasts. Rare small B cells of high density harboring EBV were capable of spontaneous outgrowth. This may be indicative of a host control mechanism that is removed upon cultivation in vitro.", "PMC1636460": "Description of one case of spontaneous fistulization between a renal calix and a descending colon, secondary to lithiasic pyonephrosis.

Most of the strains in each phage type were almost completely homogeneous, especially in their sugar fermentation reactions. However, strains of phage type 1 a/2 were not homogeneous, but could be assigned to one of four subgroups on the basis of ability to ferment inositol, inhibition of growth by meso-tartrate and auxotrophy for nicotinic acid.

Before treatment immune functions were normal in all children. Treatment with human growth hormone did not significantly affect serum immunoglobulins, polymorphonuclear cell function, or percent T cells. However, percent B cells decreased to subnormal levels in seven of seven patients. T helper/suppressor ratios decreased in all patients, to subnormal values in seven of eight patients; and mitogen responses decreased to below normal in all. The decline of percent B cells was transient in all patients, of T helper/suppressor ratios in seven of eight, and mitogen responses in five of eight patients. In vitro incubation of lymphocytes with growth hormone resulted in no changes in cell surface markers or mitogen responses. Although the depression of immune functions resulted in no increased rate of infections during the observation period, we do not know the possible effects of prolonged treatment and therefore caution against the indiscriminate use of human growth hormone.

Of the 119/216 cells tested that demonstrated antidromic activation from SON, many (60%) were orthodromically excited by SFO stimulation, whereas most (68%) were unresponsive to stimulation in the adjacent HC. Separate populations of MS-DBB neurons that displayed antidromic activation from the SFO (11/140 cells tested) or HC (24/78 tested) were orthodromically excited by SON stimulation. Three cells were activated antidromically from both the SFO and SON. These observations reveal some possible interconnections between these three brain regions and point to the existence of an indirect pathway whereby the SFO can influence SON neurons through an influence on MS-DBB neurons.", "PMC4011036": "Intracellular recordings were obtained from horizontal cells and bipolar cells of the dark-adapted, virtually all-rod retina of the dogfish. Eyecups were superfused with Ringer's solution containing micromolar concentrations of dopamine (DA). It was found that 10 microM DA hyperpolarized rod ON-centre bipolar cells and reduced their responses to light flashes. Detectable effects could be obtained with DA concentrations as low as 1 microM. A decrease in the light responses of bipolar cells due to the effects of DA was concomitant with a decrease in the amplitude of the b-wave of the electroretinogram. DA had no effect on the membrane potential or the light response of rod horizontal cells.

Folate metabolism was inhibited 99.9% by these concentrations of trimethoprim, but a low level of formylation of methionyl transfer ribonucleic acid (met-tRNA(F)) could be detected. However, in a medium containing all major amino acids, nucleosides, and vitamins, formylation of met-tRNA(F) was undetectable in the presence of trimethoprim. No other amino-masked amino acids were detected, and methionine remained a major amino-terminal amino acid of mature proteins. met-tRNA(F) was rapidly labeled with exogenous methionine and was associated with 30s ribosomal subunits and 70s ribosomes. It was concluded that initiation of protein synthesis can occur with unformylated met-tRNA(F) in E. coli. Changes in macromolecular composition were associated with the lack of formylation, in particular a fourfold increase in both met-tRNA(F) and ribosomal subunits. These changes would tend to compensate for the low specific rate of initiation with unformylated met-tRNA(F).", "PMC3880013": "The capacity of a photodynamic and a chemical source of singlet molecular oxygen to cause DNA strand breakage at pH 7.8 was compared in the following systems: (1) dissolved rose bengal plus light (400-660 nm), (2) a novel water-soluble naphthalene-derived endoperoxide showing temperature-dependent singlet oxygen release, in the absence of light. Covalently closed circular DNA was efficiently converted to the open (relaxed) form upon exposure to dissolved rose bengal plus light in a time-dependent reaction, showing that this system was capable of causing DNA strand breakage at pH 7.8. The reaction was greatly reduced under hypoxic conditions (less than 5 p.p.m. O2), was stimulated when using D2O instead of H2O as a solvent and was not inhibitable by superoxide dismutase, indicating that singlet oxygen was a critical intermediate. However, comparatively large fluxes of singlet oxygen generated by the endoperoxide completely failed to produce DNA strand breaks.

Portal venous flow measured by the pulsed Doppler flowmeter in 14 patients with cirrhosis and nine patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, who underwent operation 2-5 yr earlier, was significantly reduced compared with that in unoperated 49 patients with cirrhosis and 17 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension who had esophageal varices (410 +/- 158 versus 660 +/- 263 ml/min in cirrhosis; 443 +/- 185 versus 912 +/- 189 ml/min in idiopathic portal hypertension). In nine patients (six cirrhosis, three idiopathic portal hypertension), portal venous flow and portal vein pressure were measured before and after operation. In patients with cirrhosis, portal vein pressure did not change significantly postoperatively even though portal venous flow was reduced. In contrast, portal vein pressure decreased in two patients with idiopathic portal hypertension in whom portal venous flow was reduced.

HA was the only glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in gingival exudate from CG sites. HA was not detected at untreated AUG sites but was evident, at increasing levels, after two and seven days of effective antibacterial treatment. In AUG exudates, the total HA-degrading enzyme activity, of bacterial origin, decreased to approx. 30 and 10 per cent of the high initial levels after two and seven days of treatment respectively, to that level found at sites of CG. The specific activity of HA-degrading enzyme of lysosomal origin was low initially and increased with treatment to a level comparable to CG. The notable absence of HA from gingival exudate from sites of untreated AUG thus appears to result from the increased levels of bacterial hyaluronidase.

In an initial 3-year experience using the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 227 patients with AVM's were treated. Symptoms at presentation included prior hemorrhage in 143 patients (63%), headache in 104 (46%), and seizures in 70 (31%). Neurological deficits were present in 102 patients (45%). Prior surgical resection (resulting in subtotal removal) had been performed in 36 patients (16%). In 47 selected patients (21%), embolization procedures were performed in an attempt to reduce the AVM size prior to radiosurgery. The lesions were classified according to the Spetzler grading system: 64 (28%) were Grade VI (inoperable), 22 (10%) were Grade IV, 90 (40%) were Grade III, 43 (19%) were Grade II, and eight (4%) were Grade I. With the aid of computer imaging-integrated isodose plans for single-treatment irradiation, total coverage of the AVM nidus was possible in 216 patients (95%). The location and volume of the AVM were the most important factors for the selection of radiation dose. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed at 6-month intervals in 161 patients. Seventeen patients who had MR evidence of complete obliteration underwent angiography within 3 months of imaging: in 14 (82%) complete obliteration was confirmation being 4 months (mean 17 months) after radiosurgery. The 2-year obliteration rates according to volume were: all eight (100%) AVM's less than 1 cu cm; 22 (85%) of 26 AVM's of 1 to 4 cu cm; and seven (58%) of 12 AVM's greater than 4 cu cm. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed postirradiation changes in 38 (24%) of 161 patients at a mean interval of 10.2 months after radiosurgery; only 10 (26%) of those 38 patients were symptomatic. In the entire series, two patients developed permanent new neurological deficits believed to be treatment-related. Two patients died of repeat hemorrhage at 6 and 23 months after treatment during the latency interval prior to obliteration.

Ischemia was induced by lowering the afterload pressure of the perfused working rat heart. The activities of cathepsin D, beta,N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase were determined in the nonsedimentable and sedimentable fractions after centrifugation of the tissue extract to assess the subcellular distribution of lysosomal enzymes. After ischemia, decreases in the mechanical function and the tissue level of high-energy phosphates were observed. In addition, ischemia caused subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes from the lysosomes to the cytoplasm. Reperfusion of the ischemic heart did not restore the mechanical function and the level of high-energy phosphates completely. Diltiazem (2.21 X 10(-6), 1.11 X 10(-5) and 2.21 X 10(-5) M) was provided for the heart 5 min before the onset of ischemia. Diltiazem preserved high-energy phosphates in the ischemic heart, and inhibited the subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes being caused by ischemia, depending on its concentration. Reperfusion after ischemia with diltiazem recovered the mechanical function that had been decreased by ischemia. These results may indicate that diltiazem can protect the myocardium against ischemic damage.", "PMC3521247": "The correlation between elevated cholesterol and coronary artery disease (CAD) has emerged slowly, with the strongest statistical links appearing recently. Every major epidemiologic study carried out to date has verified the association between the concentration of serum cholesterol and the risk of CAD. Despite this, much of the medical profession continues to underrate the significance of cholesterol and lipoproteins. Programs to increase physicians' awareness of this problem are essential. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Coronary Primary Prevention Trial showed that diet and drug therapy lower cholesterol by 9% and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 12.5%, on average, in at-risk patients compared with control subjects. CAD death or nonfatal myocardial infarctions were reduced collectively by 19%. Significant decreases also occurred in the incidence of angina pectoris, new positive electrocardiograms and coronary artery bypass surgery. Data from a number of important secondary prevention trials also support lowering cholesterol and LDL to retard the growth of atherosclerotic plaque. The risk from LDL elevations depends on the extent of the increase, the concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and the presence of other major risk factors (e.g., hypertension and smoking). The ratio of total cholesterol or LDL to the high density lipoprotein concentration is the best indicator for CAD risk. Monitoring cholesterol levels should become an annual routine in the physician's office. A simple, economical blood test for cholesterol, which should be widely available soon, will make screening programs possible, but before such screening begins, plans must be in place for follow-up.

Voltage clamp recordings of the calcium current (ICa) in single myocytes which were enzymatically isolated from bull-frog atrium show that a genuine reversal of the current flowing through Ca2+ channels can be recorded (ef. Reuter & Scholz, 1977; Lee & Tsien, 1982, 1984; Campbell, Giles & Shibata, 1988c). In normal 2.5 mM [Ca2+]0 Ringer solution this apparent reversal potential (Erev) is near +50 mV, a value well below the predicted thermodynamic Ca2+ equilibrium potential (ECa). 2. None the less, Erev shifts with variations in extracellular divalent ion concentrations (Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+) according to the predictions of a Nernstian divalent cation electrode, i.e. approximately 29 mV per 10-fold change in the external concentration of divalent ion. 3. The existing theoretical analysis of this Erev has been extended in order to clarify its interpretation with regard to the selectivity characteristics of ICa. 4. The apparent reversal potential is analysed using a form of the constant field equation which has been modified to include (i) simultaneous monovalent and divalent cation movements and (ii) the presence of a surface potential (V'). This equation can be solved to yield an explicit expression for Erev. The effects of V' on apparent permeability ratios for the Ca2+ channel Erev are demonstrated. 5. In combination, our experimental results and calculations suggest that: (i) previous estimates of V' which were used to describe permeability (P) ratios of Ca2+ channels in various cardiac preparations may be in error, (ii) in normal [Ca2+]o the PNa/PCa ratio is very small, and (iii) PCa/PK must be greater than 1000. An analysis of the relative selectivity of the channel for divalent cations compared to K+ shows that PCa greater than PSr greater than PBa, assuming that PK remains the same after the divalent substitutions. 6. The Ca2+ channel in bull-frog atrial cells is thus much more selective for Ca2+ ions than had previously been estimated; in particular, inward flow of monovalent cations (e.g. Na+) through these channels does not contribute significantly to the observed ICa. The physiological implications of this high selectivity for Ca2+ ions are discussed.", "PMC3878413": "The human histocompatibility antigens HLA-A and HLA-B are polymorphic cell surface glycoproteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex. These molecules are the major targets for the immune response during tissue transplantation.

To permit a description of the sites of interaction with alloantisera and T-cell receptors, we have begun a three-dimensional structure determination of HLA-A. We report the isomorphous cyrstallization of two antigenic specificities of papain-solubilized HLA-A, A2 and A28. Isoelectric focusing indicates that the well-ordered crystals incorporate the sialic acid microheterogeneity of the oligosaccharides. Crystallographic evidence indicates that the HLA-A molecule has an approximate 2-fold rotational symmetry axis which, combined with biochemical data, suggests that the domains of the molecule are paired alpha 1 to alpha 2 and alpha 3 to beta 2-microglobulin.

In the nonparalyzed condition, adductory muscle activity showed intermittent sudden increases that coincided with momentary voice arrests. These muscle patterns and accompanying voice interruptions were not present either when speech was produced in falsetto register or at anytime during the paralysis condition.

A molecular characterization was carried out to investigate whether the native structure of the protein was retained in the presence of this detergent. Band 3 bound octyl glucoside below the critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the detergent, approaching saturation above the cmc. At 40 mM octyl glucoside, close to saturating concentrations, 0.64 g of octyl glucoside is bound per gram of band 3 protein, corresponding to 208 molecules of detergent bound per monomer of band 3. Sedimentation velocity and gel filtration studies, performed at 40 mM octyl glucoside, indicated that the band 3-octyl glucoside complex had an average molecular weight of 1.98 X 10(6), which corresponds to a dodecamer. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments confirmed that band 3 in octyl glucoside exists in a heterogeneous and high oligomeric state. This high oligomeric state did not change dramatically over octyl glucoside concentrations ranging from 6 to 60 mM. The circular dichroism spectrum of band 3 changed only slightly over this range of octyl glucoside concentrations. The alpha-helical and beta-sheet contents of band 3 in 2 mM octyl glucoside were calculated to be 40% and 27%, respectively, indicating that no gross alteration in the secondary structure of the protein had occurred in octyl glucoside. The ability of band 3 to bind 4-benzamido-4'-aminostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (BADS), a potent inhibitor (Ki = 1 microM) of anion transport, was measured to assess the integrity of the inhibitor binding site of the protein in octyl glucoside.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3311054": "40 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were included in a randomized cross-over trial comparing effects and tolerance of bezafibrate (Cedur) (200 mg t.i.d.) and colestyramine (4 g t.i.d.).

Equilibration of NBD-PC between DOPC vesicles occurs by the diffusion of soluble monomers through the water phase, which is a first-order process. Conditions were used such that the apparent transfer rate constant is equal to the rate constant for monomer-vesicle dissociation into solution. The partition distribution of NBD-PC between DOPC vesicles and water was determined by measuring the loss of NBD-PC from vesicles into solution following the dilution of small amounts of vesicles in buffer. The acyl chain length and temperature dependence of both the rate and partition measurements were determined, and a free energy diagram for NBD-PC-soluble monomer-vesicle interactions was constructed. The conclusions of this analysis are the following: NBD-PC dissociation from and association with the bilayer require passage through a high-energy transition state resulting predominantly from enthalpic energy. The activation energy for NBD-PC-vesicle dissociation becomes more positive and the standard free energy of NBD-PC transfer from water to vesicles becomes more negative with increasing acyl chain length. The standard free energy of transfer for NBD-PC from water to vesicles results predominantly from differences in enthalpy between the membrane and water phases. The enthalpy of activation for association increases with acyl chain length and is larger than expected for an aqueous diffusion-limited process in bulk water.", "PMC4066726": "A thermoplastic polymer, Delrin 150 (polyoxymethylene homopolymer), with creep resistance ten times that of ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene, is used as a material for total joint prostheses. A study was made of the local and systemic host response to this polymer when implanted in three different mammalian species. 316 LC stainless steel was used as a control. The materials were implanted into muscle and bone as solid cylinders. A total of 446 samples were implanted into 74 animals. The duration of implantation ranged from 2 weeks to 2 years. A semi-quantitative evaluation of local tissue reaction was performed. For each implant, 16 histological criteria were graded for severity of host tissue reaction. The liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, and lungs from each animal were also studied for evidence of systemic toxicity. The polymer implants exhibited a mild tissue reaction with the same characteristics as the control. Local tumor formation, bone osteolysis, and surrounding muscle necrosis were not seen. No pathological changes compatible with systemic toxicity by Delrin 150 were observed in the study of the organs. Delrin 150 in solid form did not exhibit local or systemic toxicity and is therefore biocompatible by this study. Powder implantation studies should be performed to simulate tissue response to wear particles.", "PMC3958967": "We have reported previously that after nialamide pretreatment there is an age-related difference in the stimulation of locomotor activity produced by the injection of dopamine bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens. Thus, the stimulation of locomotor activity produced by dopamine in old rats was significantly less than that of young and mature rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether nialamide was an effective inhibitor of the metabolism of dopamine after dopamine was injected into the nucleus accumbens of old rats. When we measured the concentration of injected dopamine in the limbic forebrain (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle) of young (6 months), mature (15 months) and old (26 months) rats pretreated with nialamide, the amount of dopamine that was present was significantly less in old rats than in young or mature rats. Consistent with this observation, the concentrations of the dopamine metabolites, homovanillic acid and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were higher in nialamide-pretreated old rats than in young and mature rats, suggesting that there was a smaller inhibition of the metabolism of dopamine in the limbic forebrain of old rats after nialamide pretreatment. In support of this hypothesis, nialamide (25-100 mg/kg i.p.), which inhibited monoamine oxidase activity in limbic forebrain homogenates of old, mature and young rats, was a less effective inhibitor of this enzyme in the old rats. These results suggest that the reduced locomotor activity response of old rats to the intra-accumbens injections of dopamine after nialamide pretreatment may be due to the reduced ability of nialamide to inhibit monoamine oxidase (and dopamine metabolism) in these animals.", "PMC2212707": "The results for 143 cases of ureteral stones treated by EDAP LT01 were analyzed concerning stone location, ureteral manipulation and treatment position. The ureter was divided into six segments: ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), proximal ureter (PU1 and PU2), mid-ureter (MU), distal ureter (D1 and D2). The overall fracturization rate (FR) was 72%, as detailed below: UPJ (89%, 26/29), PU1 (86%, 13/15), PU2-MU (62%, 15/24), DU1 (59%, 25/42), DU2 (72%, 24/33). Anesthesia or iv sedation were never used for PEL. 24% of the patients underwent retrograde ureteral manipulation (in situ/push back = 108/35). For PU1, the FR was twice as high after retrograde manipulation (in situ/push back = 5/8). For PU2 and MU, the supine position was most common. For UPJ and PU1, it was often better to have the patient lie on his side. For DU1 and DU2, a prone position was necessary. For all stones in DU1, the bladder must be well filled; the FR was higher in DU2 than in DU1. DU2 stones appeared to adhere to the bladder wall or were intravesical (stone in the meatus). The stone-free rate for successfully manipulated ureteral calculi (3 month's follow-up) was 93% (27/29). The stone-free rate for in situ stones at 3 months was 94% (70/74). Extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy combined with stone manipulation is highly efficient in the management of UPJ, PU1 and DU2 stones. The success rate of in situ PEL improves after the operator becomes skilled with the procedure. The advantages of the EDAP LT01 are the absence of pain, no need for anesthesia, and the mobility of the shock wave unit.", "PMC3998885": "Spectral sensitivities of the red-green and yellow-blue opponent-color responses were determined under broad-band light adaptation for the light-adaptation levels of 5 to 5000 Td. With changing light-adaptation level, the spectral-sensitivity functions of the opponent-color systems change in shape, especially in the short-wavelength region of the spectrum. The light-adaptation effect on the red-green responses can be ascribed to the changes at the cone receptor level, whereas the light-adaptation effect on the yellow-blue responses can be ascribed to the changes at two sites, i.e., at the cone receptor site and at the opponent site.", "PMC3983272": "In a study of 200 fresh adult cadavers, calvarial thickness was measured at selected points. The variables of age, height, weight, sex, and race were subjected to multiple regression analysis to determine which were significant in the determination of skull thickness. The results indicate that weight, race, and sex are the most important variables. However, the magnitude of the effects of these variables is minimal when considered in relation to clinical requirements. The study provides the clinician with a reasonable basis to obtain preoperative estimation of the thickness of calvarial grafts in the adult at four commonly utilized points.", "PMC3998880": "Concern about upper respiratory tract irritation and other symptoms among workers at a glass bottle manufacturing plant led to an epidemiologic and an industrial hygiene survey. Questionnaire responses from 35 hot end and 53 cold end workers indicated that the incidence of wheezing, chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, and cough was significantly elevated among hot end workers. Among both smokers and nonsmokers, hot end workers reported higher, but not significantly higher, rates of wheezing and chest pain. Among smokers, hot end workers reported significantly higher rates of dyspnea on exertion and cough than did cold end workers. Data suggest that reported exposure to stannic chloride solution likely caused these symptoms. The industrial hygiene survey, conducted when stannic chloride use had been reduced, cleaning had been done, and ventilation improved, focused on measuring air contaminants that might possibly cause symptoms. Levels of hydrogen chloride, which apparently was formed by the combination of stannic chloride and water in the presence of heat, were elevated. The finding of increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms among hot end workers was consistent with this exposure. Recommendations were made to reduce hazardous exposures at this plant. Individuals responsible for occupational health should be aware that relatively benign substances, such as stannic chloride and water, can combine spontaneously to form hazardous substances.", "PMC3498208": "We studied the early events in athymic immunoincompetent rats after implantation with cultured thymic fragments (CTF) under the kidney capsule, with special emphasis on the settlement of lymphocytes and non-lymphoid RT1 class II elements. At 2 weeks after grafting, tissue under the kidney capsule comprises strands of keratin-positive epithelial cells from the graft, without immigrant cells. At 3 weeks, the CTF graft is populated with lymphocytes and with non-lymphoid RT1 class II-positive cells expressing the recipient haplotype (allogeneic combinations). Part of these cells bear determinants recognized by an anti-rat dendritic cell antibody. At 4 weeks the graft exhibits a completely restored thymic architecture. At the periphery, the first indications of T-cell competence generated after CTF implantation are observed 6 weeks after implantation. At 18 weeks, the peripheral thymus-dependent immune system is almost completely developed. This includes in vitro alloreactivity, even to the donor RT1 haplotype of the graft. But skin grafts of the allogeneic CTF donor haplotype are not rejected. Thus, a state of in vivo tolerance is induced under the influence of grafted epithelium, which is not due to a specific deletion of alloreactive cells. We conclude that CTF regain their original thymic architecture between 2 and 4 weeks after implantation in (allogeneic) athymic nude recipients, and that only after this restoration does peripheral thymus-dependent immune competence start to develop.", "PMC3118354": "The oesophago-irritant potential of terodiline hydrochloride 25 mg tablets was evaluated by use of one acute and two recovery animals models, each documented to be sensitive for predicting local irritant and/or ulcerogenic effects of drugs on the human oesophageal mucosa. Both uncoated and coated terodiline hydrochloride tablets produced slight to moderate oesophageal lesions in cats sacrificed after 4 to 8 hours of tablet exposure, whereas emepronium bromide, a drug associated with oesophageal injury in man, showed moderate to severe oesophago-irritant properties when tested in the same model. No significant oesophageal changes were, however, observed with coated terodiline hydrochloride tablets in cats or pigs subjected to five days of recovery after an initial tablet exposure period of eight and five hours, respectively. The results indicate that the oesophago-irritant effect of terodiline hydrochloride 25 mg tablets is very mild and also transient. Thus no or only a minimal risk of oesophageal irritation after accidental lodging of the tablet in the oesophagus is to be anticipated in patients.", "PMC2808181": "Currently less than .4% of the slaughtered pigs contain sulfamethazine at levels above those allowed by the Food and Drug Administration. These violations are due partly to failure to properly withdraw sulfamethazine after treatment to reduce loss or combat or prevent diseases, whereas others are due to inadvertent contamination of feed or the environment. Cull animals particularly are suspect. The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), representing more than 100,000 producers, is supporting attempts to reduce violations and maintain the safe image of pork. The Food and Drug Administration is continuing to evaluate the safety of sulfamethazine, and the NPPC has encouraged producers to suspend use of the drug. The NPPC is encouraging development of faster, more reliable testing methods and of a traceback system to permit the farm of origin to be identified. But the NPPC is opposed to the \"bill back\" proposal developed by the Packers and Stockyard Administration that would allow packers to charge the seller for costs of carcasses condemned for containing illegal residues. Reasons for opposition include imprecision of current testing procedures, inaccuracy of present identification and traceback methods and disruption of the free market relationship between buyers and sellers.", "PMC3230280": "We report the technique and results of vertical banded gastroplasty in 86 morbidly obese patients. At 12 months, the patients had lost a mean of 57% of their excess body weight; 36 months, they had lost 70%. The most severe early complication was perforation of the esophagus. Other complications included disruption of the vertical staple line in three cases and migration of the mesh band. We were able to achieve satisfactory weight reduction in all patients over a period of 36 months. In view of the good results, reduced morbidity, and absence of mortality, we feel that vertical banded gastroplasty is the surgical treatment of choice for morbid obesity at present.", "PMC3206306": "Dynamic tests of trunk strength and lifting capacity have become more popular in recent years, offering certain advantages over static isometric tests in measuring patient progress in functional restoration programs for spinal disorders. However, equipment for performing such tests is expensive to buy, complex to run, and requires technical expertise and clinical volume unavailable in most physician offices. In this study, a new dynamic test known as Progressive Isoinertial Lifting Evaluation (PILE) is described, which draws upon prior psychophysical and isoinertial methods. An industrial sample of 61 male and 31 female incumbent workers were tested using the PILE, and a variety of anthropometric normalizing factors were evaluated. The isolation of an \"Adjusted Weight\" (AW) normalizing factor is documented, after which normative data are presented for male and female workers utilizing lumbar (0-30 inches) and cervical (30-54 inches) dynamic protocols.", "PMC3401443": "A method has been developed for identifying the step in a detergent-mediated reconstitution procedure at which an integral membrane protein can be associated with phospholipids to give functional proteoliposomes. Large liposomes prepared by reverse-phase evaporation were treated with various amounts of the detergents Triton X-100, octyl glucoside, or sodium cholate as described in the preceding paper [Paternostre, M.-T., Roux, M., & Rigaud, J. L. (1988) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue)]. At each step of the solubilization process, we added bacteriorhodopsin, the light-driven proton pump from Halobacterium halobium. The protein-phospholipid detergent mixtures were then subjected to SM2 Bio-Beads treatments to remove the detergent, and the resulting vesicles were analyzed with respect to protein insertion and orientation in the membrane by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, sucrose density gradients, and proton pumping measurements. The nature of the detergent used for reconstitution proved to be important for determining the mechanism of protein insertion. With sodium cholate, proteoliposomes were formed only from ternary phospholipid-protein-detergent micelles. With octyl glucoside, besides proteoliposome formation from ternary mixed micelles, direct incorporation of bacteriorhodopsin into preformed liposomes destabilized by saturating levels of this detergent was observed and gave proteoliposomes with optimal proton pumping activity. With Triton X-100, protein insertion into destabilized liposomes was also observed but involved a transfer of the protein initially present in phospholipid-Triton X-100-protein micelles into Triton X-100 saturated liposomes. Our results further demonstrated that protein orientation in the resulting proteoliposomes was critically dependent upon the mechanism by which the protein was incorporated.", "PMC3003375": "The time course of appearance of type I topoisomerase activity after the infection of mouse L cytoplasts by vaccinia virus was determined. When the enucleation procedure was carried out with unsynchronized cell cultures, a high level of host-cell-specific type I topoisomerase activity was found associated with the resulting cytoplasts. If cells were first synchronized by the two-cycle thymidine block method and then enucleated after release, the level of host type I topoisomerase activity was also high for S-phase-enucleated cells but was very low for cytoplasts prepared from cells previously synchronized and enucleated during either the G1 or the G2 phase. After the infection of G1-phase-enucleated cytoplasts with vaccinia virus, newly synthesized type I topoisomerase activity first appeared at about 3 h postinfection. Virosomes were isolated from the infected, synchronized cytoplasts and assayed for the presence of type I topoisomerase activity. The activity remained at the top of a sucrose gradient, well resolved from the virosome fraction, at the low salt levels (0.01 M KCl, 0.01 M Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0) normally used in the course of virosome purification. If the sedimentation was at the higher salt concentration (0.15 M KCl) at which the enzyme shows optimal activity, type I topoisomerase cosedimented with the virosome fraction onto the sucrose gradient cushion. These results show that the type I topoisomerase activity dependent upon vaccinia virus infection may be detected with high sensitivity in G1-phase-enucleated cytoplasts. The association with virosomes is consistent with an involvement of topoisomerase activity either in DNA replication or in late transcription.", "PMC3997511": "Measurements were made of the relative distribution of ultraviolet radiation intensity on the surface of the human body in UV cabins manufactured by Waldmann in the Federal Republic of Germany (UV 1000 and UV 6000).

The study group consisted of 200 patients who had double-contrast esophagrams and endoscopy because of severe reflux symptoms. The radiographs were reviewed by two gastrointestinal radiologists who had no knowledge of the endoscopic findings. Patients were classified as being at high risk for Barrett's esophagus if the radiographs revealed a high stricture or ulcer or a reticular mucosal pattern; at moderate risk if the radiographs revealed a distal peptic stricture and/or reflux esophagitis; and at low risk if none of the aforementioned findings were present. When these radiologic criteria were used, 10 patients (5%) were thought to be at high risk, 73 (37%) at moderate risk, and 117 (58%) at low risk for Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopic correlation revealed biopsy-proved Barrett's mucosa in nine (90%) of 10 patients at high risk, in 12 (16%) of 73 at moderate risk, and in only one (1%) of 117 at low risk for Barrett's esophagus. Thus, endoscopy is clearly indicated for patients in the high-risk group. Because of the lower prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in the moderate-risk group, clinical judgment should be used in deciding when to perform endoscopy in these patients. However, most patients were in the low-risk group, and the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus was so low in this group that endoscopy does not appear to be warranted. Thus, the major value of double-contrast esophagography is its ability to separate patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups for Barrett's esophagus to determine the relative need for endoscopy and biopsy.", "PMC3292015": "Experiments with rats demonstrate that free skin transplants between genetically distinct strains become totally rejected after no longer than 3 weeks. In intermingled skin transplants, however, the autogenic epidermis directly covers the allodermis, which results in a definitively covered wound with a mostly normal skin texture. It seems that during the first phase after the burn the allodermis is accepted as donor skin. In the second phase it becomes covered by the epidermis and surrounded by the connective tissue of the recipient. During this process all structures of ectodermal origin like skin adnexa are rejected. Since for the most part the elastic fibres in the allograft remain unchanged after a successful intermingled skin transplantation, the transplant shows elasticity similar to a mesh autograft, but it is incapable of regenerating skin adnexa.

The accident in Seveso took place in July, 1976, and this study was carried out from October, 1982, to May, 1983. Although a peripheral neuropathy was not found in any of the subjects, a significant increase of the number of individuals presenting at least two bilateral clinical signs (p less than 0.05) or one abnormal electrophysiological parameter (p less than 0.02) was found in the Seveso group. Principal component analysis did not show any subdivision between these two groups. The Fisher approach to discriminant analysis reveals a clear subdivision between the group of the most exposed subjects and randomly selected subgroups of control subjects. In conclusion, clinical and electrophysiological signs of peripheral nervous system involvement occur with a statistically increased frequency in the Seveso population 6 years after the accident, although a peripheral neuropathy was not evident in any of the chloracne patients using the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria.", "PMC3980062": "To assess the role of the sympathetic nervous system in mineralocorticoid hypertension in humans, results from 24 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma were compared with those in 27 appropriately matched essential hypertensive subjects and 26 normotensive subjects. Resting plasma catecholamine levels averaged 292 +/- 140 (SD) pg/ml in patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma, 305 +/- 101 in patients with essential hypertension, and 260 +/- 120 in normotensive subjects; none of the differences among the three groups was significant. With head-up tilt (60 degrees for 10 min) plasma catecholamine levels increased similarly in the aldosterone-producing adenoma and essential hypertensive groups (up to 681 +/- 111 and 611 +/- 57 pg/ml respectively, NS). beta-Blockade (propranolol, 10 mg i.v.) in eight aldosterone-producing adenoma patients decreased heart rate (from 78 +/- 5 to 68 +/- 3 beats/min, p less than 0.005) and cardiac output (from 5.5 +/- 0.4 to 4.6 +/- 0.3 liter/min, p less than 0.001), but left mean blood pressure unchanged (127 +/- 4 to 127 +/- 2 mm Hg). Combined alpha- and beta-blockade with phentolamine and propranolol in five patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma produced no detectable changes in blood pressure.

Qualitative rules for the prediction of the stereochemistries of organic reactions have been devised, and semi-empirical computational models have also been developed to predict the stereoselectivities of reactions of large organic molecules, such as nucleophilic additions to carbonyls, electrophilic hydroborations and cycloadditions, and intramolecular radical additions and cycloadditions.", "PMC3501574": "We undertook a prospective study of children from three to 24 months of age with rectal temperatures of greater than or equal to 40.0 degrees C (104.0 degrees F) to determine if children whose fevers fail to respond to antipyretic therapy are more likely to be bacteremic than children whose fevers are lowered by antipyretic measures. Children from two clinical settings were studied: primarily black lower-class children at an inner-city hospital (n = 188) and primarily white middle-class children at a suburban hospital (n = 45). We found an overall prevalence of bacteremia of 7.3%, which was not statistically different between two hospitals. A response to antipyretic therapy, defined as a decrease in temperature of at least 1 degrees C, was seen in 83.7% of children. Children who did not respond to antipyretics had no more increased prevalence of bacteremia than did responders.

Accumulation of (14)C-glycerol was almost completely absent in uninduced cells and in a transport-negative mutant. Kinetic studies with induced cells suggested that glycerol may be transported by two systems with different affinities for glycerol. Osmotically shocked cells did not transport glycerol, and the supernatant fluid from shocked cells contained glycerol-binding activity demonstrable by equilibrium dialysis. The binding protein was not glycerol kinase. Binding activity was absent in shock fluids from the transport-negative mutant and from uninduced cells. The glycerol-binding protein was partially purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Mild heat treatment completely eliminated the binding activity of shock fluid and of the partially purified protein. Sodium azide and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited both transport by whole cells and binding of glycerol by shock fluid. It is concluded that transport of glycerol by P. aeruginosa involves a binding protein responsible for recognition of glycerol and may occur by facilitated diffusion or active transport.

It was demonstrated that stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) (either by direct injection or by ingestion of antigen) followed by local administration of antigen into the bronchus was required to enhance clearance in this model. The primary effect of GALT immunization persisted for at least 6 wk; it was specific and could not be replaced by systemic immunization. Failure to stimulate locally in the bronchus was associated with protracted clearance. No clear correlation between local or systemic antibody and bacterial clearance was demonstrated; however, immunized rats were shown to have faster recruitment of phagocytic cells to the bronchial spaces, and these phagocytes had a higher activity state than cells harvested from nonimmunized animals. It is probable that bacterial clearance is accelerated in immunized animals due in part to factors mediating a change in the behavior of luminal phagocytes.", "PMC4053307": "Sixty-two chick embryo hearts were studied at incremental stages of development (Hamburger-Hamilton stages 16 to 39) by scanning electron microscopy following 3% glutaraldehyde fixation and critical point drying. Early in cardiac development, the primitive ventricle becomes homogeneously trabeculated with highly organized sheets of myocytes lined by endocardial cells, with the trabeculae generally oriented in the dorsoventral direction. Coalescence of these trabecular sheets begins at stage 26, initially at the area of the bulboventricular flange, and later proceeding caudally toward the floor of the ventricle. The fusion process is finished by stage 30, resulting in a muscular ventricular septum that has now divided the primitive ventricle into right and left ventricles. Further growth of the ventricular septum is by continued fusion of the adjoining trabecular sheets. Remnants of the apposing trabecular sheets are found in the solidified muscular septum in the form of endocardial channels. We suggest that persistent patency of these channels results in muscular ventricular septal defects.", "PMC4321713": "The development of a reagent-impregnated paper strip test for niacin is described.

Serum-free cultures of granulosa cells were established and found to be viable for 3-6 days of cell culture. Radiolabeled granulosa cell-secreted proteins were obtained and analyzed electrophoretically. No major changes were detected in the protein profiles of small, medium, and large follicle granulosa cells. FSH and insulin, however, had a dramatic effect on granulosa cell-secreted proteins and increased the apparent production of 200K, 65K, 25K, and 15K proteins. The effects of these hormones on the radiolabeled secreted proteins were similar for small, medium, and large follicle granulosa cells. Aromatase activity was high for the first day of serum-free granulosa cell culture and subsequently declined to low levels. Both FSH and insulin alone stimulated aromatase activity, while a combination of hormones resulted in an additive response similar to the stimulation observed with 10% calf serum. Although the level of aromatase activity increased slightly with the size of the follicle, the effects of hormones were independent of follicle size. Progesterone production was low on days 1 and 2 of serum-free granulosa cell culture and high on days 3 and 6 of cell culture. Interestingly, FSH and insulin suppressed progesterone production on day 1 of cell culture for small and medium follicle granulosa cells, but not for large follicle cells. In contrast, hormones stimulated progesterone production on days 3 and 6 of granulosa cell culture, and the level of progesterone production increased with the size of the follicle. The stimulatory effects of hormones on days 3 and 6 of the culture were similar for medium and large follicle granulosa cells, but were altered for small follicle cells. Results indicate that when aromatase activity is high and stimulated by hormones, progesterone levels are low and generally suppressed by the same regulatory agents. Conversely when progesterone levels are high and hormone responsive, aromatase activity is low. The inverse relationship between aromatase activity and progesterone production implies that bovine granulosa cells alter their differentiated state in culture from an estrogen-producing cell to a progesterone-producing cell. Combined observations indicate that the results obtained on day 1 of culture probably reflect the developmental and hormonal regulation of granulosa cell function in the preovulatory follicle, while data obtained at later times in culture reflect the ability of the cell to synthesize progesterone and develop a luteinization-like activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC3211433": "On the basis of previous work with various monoclonal antibodies (Mab) raised against carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), the anti-CEA Mab 47 was identified which selectively reacted with a surface glycoprotein (95 kDa; NCA 95) of normal human granulocytes. This new tracer was quality tested and radioiodinated with 123I (123I Mab 47) for clinical use according to established procedures. Extended in vitro studies revealed a high selectivity for granulocytes without inhibiting their vital functions. In vivo cell binding to the granulocyte pool was completed very rapidly and remained unchanged over 24 h. For clinical use one dose consisting of 120 mcg of Mab was labelled with 4-5 mCi of 123I. Clinical interest was mainly concentrated on cases of osteomyelitis, infected allografts and abdominal and brain abscesses. After injection of 123I Mab 47, infectious lesions were usually seen after 3-5 h or could be excluded after 24 h. Because of high counting rates the image quality was excellent and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) could be performed for an exact topographical localization of the lesions. No adverse reactions have been seen. It is concluded that there are distinct advantages of the new method compared with scanning of 111In-labelled leucocytes. However, despite this and the low dose of antibodies administered, we recommend restriction of immunoscintigraphy of infectious lesions before a clinically relevant immunization can be excluded.", "PMC3900376": "The role of intravenous salt solutions in resuscitation is reviewed historically.

In the transacylation of 4-aminoazobenzene catalyzed by AHNAT, 4-substituents (chloro, phenoxy, and mono-, di-, and trichlorophenoxy groups) of N-phenylacetohydroxamic acid enhanced the ability of the unsubstituted hydroxamic acid to serve as acetyl donors. As to the number of chlorines in the phenoxy group, the activity increased with decreasing number from three to zero. Of the monochlorophenoxy compounds, the 4'-chloro compound was the most effective acetyl donor. In 3-substituents (chloro and phenoxy groups) of N-phenylacetohydroxamic acid, the 3-chloro compound was an effective acetyl donor similarly to the 4-chloro compound, whereas the 3-phenoxy compound was 48% as active as the 4-phenoxy compound. None of 2-substituted N-phenylacetohydroxamic acids examined showed transacetylation activity. As to the effect of acyl group structure on the activity, N-propionyl, N-glycoloyl, and N-formyl derivatives of the 4-(4'-chlorophenoxy) compound were only 4, 2, and 0% as active as the corresponding acetyl compound, respectively. Esterification of the N-arylacetohydroxamic acid decreased the activity; O-acetyl, O-methyl, O-glucosyl, and O-glucuronosyl derivatives of the 4-(4'-chlorophenoxy) compound were 35, 7, 0, and 0% as active as the corresponding N-hydroxy compound, respectively.", "PMC2902501": "The effect of laser surgery on tissues of the periodontal apparatus was studied histologically in dogs using block surface light microscopy, a novel microscopical method. With this approach, changes in the hard and soft tissue components were concomitantly demonstrated; the method enabled preservation of the in situ relationship between these components. Following laser surgery, healing in the gingiva was delayed as suggested by the presence of epithelial ulcerations and dense inflammatory infiltrate. In the enamel and cementum the application of laser resulted in crater-like defects that could be avoided only partially by insertion of a tinfoil shield into the gingival sulcus. In the vicinity of the cementoenamel junction these defects were filled with epithelium or periodontal ligament fibers; the close proximity of the hard and soft tissues at the defect sites suggested occurrence of new attachment. Enamel defects located coronal to the gingiva contained bacterial plaque. These histologic results do not demonstrate any substantial advantage of laser over conventional knife gingivectomy. Such advantage may be accomplished with the design of a special intraoral handpiece and further experiments.", "PMC3197589": "Obstructive jaundice occurring in a patient with portal hypertension is a rare association. In this report, a 24-year-old patient is described who had biliary obstruction due to a portal cavernoma compressing the common bile duct and in whom surgical decompression of the portal system resulted in relief of the biliary obstruction, thus proving that the dilated portal vein collaterals were compressing the biliary tract and producing jaundice.

Fifteen healthy volunteers were treated with sulglycotide 400 mg t.i.d. for 10 days. Before and after treatment the bicarbonate content of basal gastric juice was determined by Feldman and Barnett's method. Sulglycotide was found to increase significantly (p less than 0.0001) basal HCO3- production from the human stomach, thus strengthening the gastric mucosal defences.

This model includes a correction for whole-brain recovery coefficient, a correction for the underestimation of flow due to the nonlinearity of the CBF model when considering tissue that includes both gray and white matter, the use of in vitro-determined brain-blood partition coefficients for gray and white matter, and a variation of the equilibrium model that permits the arterial concentration to vary. CBF values using this method compare well with values determined previously. Regional determinations using a brain overlay atlas are presented. Radiation dosimetry for the continuous infusion of H2(15)O is also included.", "PMC2862302": "The autonomic and antihypertensive activities of amosulalol (YM-09538) were studied in conscious rats. Single oral administration of amosulalol antagonized the phenylephrine-induced pressor and isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic responses with DR10 values of 11.5 and 13.6 mg/kg in pithed rats, respectively, indicating that the compound inhibits both alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors to almost the same extent in agreement with previously reported results in vitro. Amosulalol was approximately 50 times less potent than prazosin and 12 times more potent than labetalol at alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and it was approximately as effective as labetalol and 2 times more potent than propranolol at beta 1-adrenoceptors. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), renal hypertensive rats and DOCA/salt hypertensive rats, a single oral administration of amosulalol (3-30 mg/kg) lowered acutely systolic blood pressure with a duration of over 6 hr and was found to be approximately 50 times less potent than prazosin and 3 times more potent than labetalol in lowering blood pressure. Propranolol did not cause such an immediate hypotensive effect. Amosulalol and labetalol did not increase heart rate, whereas prazosin induced a tachycardia in the hypertensive rats. Repeated oral administrations of amosulalol and labetalol (50 mg/kg/day, b.i.d., for 12 weeks) produced not only an antihypertensive effect without evidence of tolerance, but also reductions in plasma renin activity (PRA) and heart rate in SHR with established hypertension. We conclude that alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by amosulalol might account for its antihypertensive activity and that its beta-adrenoceptor blockade might inhibit reflexogenic increases in heart rate and PRA due to the reduction in blood pressure.", "PMC3756341": "The experimental hemophthalm caused by the administration of different amounts of blood (0.1 to 1.2 ml) into the vitreous body of 74 rabbits with the following analysis of the results in I h-3.5 years has demonstrated that hematoma developed in the vitreous body at the moment of blood administration and persisted for 6-7 months.

The basis of the technique is the increase in epigastric impedance after the ingestion of a nonionic fluid. The subsequent decline in impedance is used as a measure of gastric emptying. The impedance epigastrograph used consisted of a four-electrode array (two source, two detector) that was applied over the epigastrium. The method was sufficiently sensitive to measure the effects of pregnancy, labor, and narcotics on gastric emptying. There was no difference in the rate of gastric emptying between pregnant and nonpregnant females. Labor appeared to cause a significant delay in gastric emptying; the mean +/- SEM time taken for the gastric volume to decrease to 50% (T0.5) was 7.2 +/- 0.6 min during pregnancy and 13.0 +/- 1.9 min in the immediate postpartum period. However, the principal factor associated with the delay in gastric emptying in the group studied within 60 min of delivery was probably the use of meperidine and promethazine, because there was a significant difference (P less than 0.05) between subjects who received meperidine and promethazine during labor and those in another group who had received either no analgesia or extradural analgesia, the T0.5 values for the two groups being 18.2 +/- 4.0 and 10.3 +/- 1.4 min, respectively.", "PMC3496038": "Electrocardiograms from 204 subjects aged 60 and above, residing in homes for the aged, were analysed. 13% had evidence of cardiovascular disease. 55% of the electrocardiograms showed at least one abnormality.

Insulin present in plasma and in glomerular ultrafiltrate is known to be degraded at this nephron site. This paper summarizes what is known about these processes and about the mechanisms by which the actions of insulin and the degradation of insulin are effected in the proximal tubular epithelial cell. Recent studies have characterized the binding of insulin to specific receptors present in the proximal tubular basolateral membrane. Binding of insulin to its receptor in this membrane is thought to initiate events that lead to the phosphorylation of that receptor. Such insulin-stimulated phosphorylation may mediate hormonal action. A possible role for insulin-like growth factor II in the modulation of the actions of insulin has been suggested by observations in the kidney and in nonrenal cells. These findings are integrated into a model characterizing the nature of the interaction of insulin with the renal proximal tubular cell.", "PMC4029881": "The final growth pattern of 27 children who developed growth hormone deficiency after treatment of an intracranial tumour other than craniopharyngioma was assessed retrospectively.

The IgG response was mainly restricted to subclasses 1 and 4 but a few patients were IgG2 and IgG3 responders. An intense and early IgG1 response was observed during the first clusters of injection followed by a levelling down of the titer. The IgG4 response had a later onset and showed slowly increasing levels during the 12 months of immunotherapy. The graded clinical efficacy estimated by symptom-medication score was significantly correlated to the preseasonal IgG1 value, with high values indicating a deleterious response of immunotherapy (deterioration of disease activity). Likewise, the fold increase of IgG1 and IgG4 after two clusters of immunotherapy (i.e. after 4 weeks) was significantly related to the clinical outcome. Little or no increase of IgG1 and IgG4 was associated with improvement, i.e. decrease in symptom-medication score. The magnitude of the IgG1 response during the dose-increase phase was directly correlated to the number of systemic side effects. No relation of IgG1, IgG4 or IgG4/IgG1 ratio to changes in the IgE-mediated parameters (skin prick test, bronchial challenge and circulating specific IgE) was observed. Our data, which are based on few patients and only one allergen system, do not support the hypothesis of IgG acting as blocking antibody being the immunologic mechanism of immunotherapy. The association between high IgG4 values and a deleterious efficacy of immunotherapy might be caused by IgG4 acting as sensitizing antibodies. This explanation, however, is opposed by the lack of relation to systemic side effects.", "PMC3487835": "The umbilicated nodules in colonic lymphoma may simulate aphthous ulcers of inflammatory or infectious colitides.

After fixation with glutaraldehyde, post-fixation with osmium tetroxide and flat-embedding in Epon, 4-micron-thick sections of the entire slices were radioautographed by dipping in nuclear emulsion. As previously reported, dopamine (DA) terminals could be specifically visualized and counted following incubation with 1 micron [3H]DA and 5 microM desipramine (DMI) with or without 5 microM citalopram (CITAL). The number of NA terminals could thus be obtained by subtracting DA varicosities from the total number of sites labeled in adjacent slices incubated without DMI but in presence of CITAL to eliminate some interspecific labeling of 5-HT terminals. NA terminals could also be identified exclusively and counted after labeling with 1 microM [3H]NA in the presence of 10 microM benztropine. 5-HT terminals were specifically detected after incubation with 1 microM [3H]5-HT in the presence of 10 microM non-radioactive NA. The labeled varicosities were counted in areas FR1 and PAR1 of the frontal and the parietal neocortex, respectively, with the aid of a microcomputer-based image analysis system. DA varicosities were concentrated mainly in layer VI of these regions and were more numerous in the frontal than the parietal area. NA terminals were equally distributed in the two regions but approximately twice as numerous in layer I than subjacent layers. The 5-HT innervation also showed a comparable overall density in the two cortical regions but with a differing intracortical distribution. In the frontal area, 5-HT terminals were slightly more concentrated in layer I (1.3-fold) than underlying layers where they were rather uniformly distributed. In the parietal area, layer I was again the most densely innervated (1.8 times the average), but a second zone of higher density (1.5 times average) was present in the outer part of layer V. The remaining layers showed lower numbers of 5-HT terminals than in the frontal region. To obtain absolute estimates of these innervation densities, the number of detected varicosities was assessed experimentally as a function of radioautographic exposure time and of histological section thickness, and their 'equivalent circle diameter' was measured in electron microscope radioautographs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC3738590": "One hundred sixty-two adolescents being seen for sick or well visits at two suburban private pediatric practices completed an anonymous, written questionnaire about drug habits.

This ingestion was inhibited 80-90% by the presence of polyclonal F(ab')2 anti-C3 fragments. Since the phagocytosis of both C3b- and iC3b-coated beads was about threefold stronger than for C3b-coated beads (trypsinized serum-treated beads), the results indicate that the CR3 is more phagocytic than the CR1. The phagocytosis of initially complement uncoated beads, which are slowly opsonized with macrophage-produced C3b and iC3b in vitro, was also strongly inhibited (70-80%) by the presence of anti-human C3 F(ab')2 fragments. There was an increased phagocytosis (10-17%) of complement precoated beads by macrophages cultured on the fibronectin substrate versus the plastic substrate.

This study examined the distribution of estradiol and progesterone receptors (ER and PR, respectively) within the primate ovary throughout the menstrual cycle. Ovaries were collected from rhesus or cynomolgus monkeys during the early, mid-, and late (n = 3-6/stage) follicular and luteal phases of the cycle. The tissues were processed for indirect immunocytochemical localization of receptors with specific monoclonal antibodies against ER (H222 and D75) and PR (JZB39). Specific immunocytochemical staining, as determined by comparing adjacent tissue sections incubated with either receptor antibodies or a nonspecific antibody, was exclusively nuclear. Both ER and PR were localized in the germinal epithelium of ovaries at all stages of the cycle. ER was not detected in any other ovarian structure (i.e. stroma, follicles, interstitial tissue, or corpora lutea) regardless of the stage of development. However, ER was detected in other estrogen-responsive tissues, e.g. the oviduct of the monkey and corpora lutea of the pseudopregnant rabbit. In the monkey ovary, PR was detected in stromal and interstitial tissues as well as theca interna and externa of healthy and atretic follicles at all stages of the cycle. The granulosa cells of some primordial and primary follicles demonstrated staining for PR. However, the granulosa layer of follicles that developed beyond the primary stage were consistently negative for PR. Only the granulosa layer of large preovulatory follicles that showed signs of luteinization after the LH surge showed staining for PR equivalent to that in the theca. Monkey corpora lutea exhibited specific nuclear staining for PR. Moreover, the percentage of receptor-positive nuclei in the corpus luteum varied (P less than 0.05) between the early (28 +/- 3%), mid (48 +/- 1%)-, and late (4 +/- 2%) luteal phase of the cycle. Nonfunctional (serum progesterone less than 0.5 ng/ml) regressing corpora lutea did not exhibit for staining for PR. Luteal cells that were PR positive also contained histochemically detectable 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

These changes begin to reverse when the axons start to innervate the tectum and by 3 months after the lesion the cell bodies have nearly returned to normal. When the axons projecting to the caudal tectum were severed by a mediolateral transection of the tectum, only retinal ganglion cells in the nasal portion of the contralateral retina underwent the changes normally associated with regeneration, followed by a speedy return to normal. Because the injured fibers probably did not fully retract from the tectum, these results indicated that: (1) the complete removal of the axons from the tectal milieu was not essential for initiating the cell body changes, and (2) close proximity to the target sites would speed the recovery of the cells. When the caudal portion of the tectum was ablated the retinal ganglion cells of the nasal retina remained enlarged significantly longer than after tectal transection. During the time the cells remained enlarged the electrophysiological projection onto the remaining rostral part of the tectum revealed no significant 'compression' of the visual field. Compression of the visual field onto the rostral portion of the tectum can be accelerated if the caudal tectal ablation is accompanied by an optic nerve crush. However, under this condition the recovery of ganglion cells in the nasal retina was significantly slower than the recovery of cells in the temporal retina. This may reflect an element of topographical specificity in the regulation of the recovery of the cell body from axonal injury.", "PMC3997902": "The importance of stress-strain myocardial constitutive relations is that they provide a criterion for behavior in vivo. Our purpose was to develop constitutive equations which are valid in diastole. The myocardium was assumed to be composed of a nonlinear viscoelastic, inhomogeneous, anisotropic (transversely isotropic) and incompressible material operating under adiabatic and isothermal conditions. The expressions contain five moduli. Two are fixed by the restriction of incompressibility, one is estimated, the remaining two refer to directions along and perpendicular to a fiber. Both possess a bimodal variation with intermodal switching occurring in late rapid filling and diastasis. They are functions of time and material constants. These constants can be observed. A dynamic test is suggested. Constitutive statements complete a set of equations sufficient for the solution of a class of boundary value problems. One type is formulated. They also permit the determination of stress from measured strain. Examples are given.", "PMC3676822": "Voltammetric electrodes have been used to monitor extracellular dopamine in rat brain slices. The electrode tips are small enough to be immersed inside the slice. Specificity for dopamine is increased through the use of voltammetry and a cation exchange membrane at the electrode tip. Dopamine overflow is observed in the caudate nucleus following electrical stimulation (60 Hz, 1 s, 3 V) with an adjacent bipolar electrode. The amount of overflow observed is increased when the tissue is perfused with 10 microM cocaine or nomifensine, both recognized inhibitors of dopamine uptake. The ability of dopamine in the perfusion buffer to permeate the slice was monitored with two voltammetric electrodes, one in the cerebral cortex and the other in the caudate nucleus. At a high concentration (100 microM), dopamine rapidly appeared (2.7 +/- 0.4 min) in the interior of the cortex, but dopamine was not observed in the caudate until a significantly later time (8.9 +/- 1.0 min). To examine whether this difference is a reflection of the presence of different uptake systems in the two regions, pressure ejection was employed. In this experiment a double-barrelled pipette was used to eject dopamine or DOPAC at a fixed distance (approximately 70 micron) from the voltammetric electrode. Ejection of small amounts of both substances could be detected in the cortex. When the ejector-detector assembly was moved to the caudate, dopamine could only be observed following pressure ejection after perfusion of the slice with 10 microM nomifensine. Detection of DOPAC was unaffected. All of these experiments indicate that uptake systems in the caudate keep dopamine concentrations very low in the extracellular fluid of the slice.", "PMC2289873": "Serum corticosteroid (CS) levels were measured in (B6xA)F1 mice following the implantation of ALZET mini-osmotic pumps. Studies of shipment stress were used as a basis for comparison. At 24 and 48 h following the implantation of pumps CS levels were moderately elevated. However, immunization of animals at 24 h postsurgery with sheep erythrocytes showed normal immune responses. The results of these experiments indicate that the use of mini-osmotic pumps for the delivery of immunomodulatory drugs induces moderate and short-term increases in CS levels, which do not appear to interfere with normal immune function.", "PMC3985798": "Between 1970 and 1976, 1,112 patients underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Follow-up, ranging from six to 12 years, was complete in 1,087 patients (97.7%). The most frequent cause of late deaths was coronary artery disease (45.6%), but significant morbidity related to the peripheral vascular system had developed in 94 patients, and led to 8.4% (48 patients) of all late deaths. Forty-nine true, 14 anastomotic, and five dissecting aneurysms were detected in 59 patients (5.4%) a mean (+/- SD) of 5.2 +/- 3.1 years after the initial aneurysm repair. These aneurysms were located in the thoracic (24), thoracoabdominal (five), or abdominal aorta (11), and in the iliac (six), femoral (17), popliteal (four), and renal arteries (one). Only one of 26 patients presenting with a rupture of one of these secondary aneurysms survived. There was a significant association between preoperative hypertension and recurrent aneurysm. These findings suggest that subsequent vascular disease, including recurrent aneurysms and graft complications, cause significant late morbidity and mortality after repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Careful follow-up and adequate control of hypertension may allow reduction in morbidity and an improvement in late survival.", "PMC4259475": "Initial energy utilization in the twitch is visualized as the result of the activity of two distinct processes. The first is the calcium-pumping activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which has a constant energy requirement under normal conditions. The second is the chemomechanical transduction process consisting of a variable number of quantal contractile events, each with a fixed enthalpy equal to the molecular enthalpy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis in vivo. This enthalpy appears either as heat or as contractile element work. Total enthalpy varies according to the number of quantal contractile events that occur in the twitch cycle. The basis of the variation is suggested to be velocity-dependent activity of the actomyosin ATPase, allowing more quantal events to occur in a contraction cycle when shortening occurs. The classical designation \"activation heat\" is held to be appropriate for the first process. The partition of the enthalpy of the second process that is currently in vogue is held to be misleading and a new formulation is suggested in which the properties of the quantal contractile event are reflected in general terms. The formulation of the proposed transduction model represents a conceptual return to the viscoelastic theory, but at a quantal level. The model can explain the results of the preceding paper and is adaptable to different muscles without having to postulate fundamental differences in energy utilization.", "PMC3044290": "Acinetobacter calcoaceticus LMD 79.41 produced significant amounts of pyrrolo-quinoline quinone (PQQ) in its culture medium when grown on quinic acid or shikimic acid. Studies with LMD 79.41 and PQQ- -mutants of this strain demonstrated that this organism contains an NAD(P)-independent quinate dehydrogenase (QDH) (EC 1.1.99.-), catalyzing the first degradation step of these compounds, and that the enzyme contains PQQ as a cofactor, i.e. is a quinoprotein. Synthesis of QDH was induced by protocatechuate and the enzyme appeared to be particle-bound. Acinetobacter Iwoffi RAG-1 produced a quinoprotein QDH apoenzyme since growth on quinic acid only occurred in the presence of PQQ. The results obtained with the PQQ- -mutants of strain LMD 79.41 also provided some insight into the regulation of PQQ biosynthesis and assemblage of quinoprotein enzymes in the periplasmic space. Since two species of Pseudomonas also contained a quinoprotein QDH, it is assumed that bacterial NAD(P)-independent quinate dehydrogenase is a quinoprotein.", "PMC3985796": "Computed tomographic (CT) scans are used to evaluate victims of blunt trauma for abdominal injury when reasons for immediate laparotomy are not present. Twenty-four patients whose CT scans showed liver injuries that were small parenchymal lacerations or intrahepatic hematomas were managed without laparotomy. Intra-abdominal blood was absent or estimated to be less than 250 mL in volume. None of the patients were in shock; six patients required transfusions, none for acute abdominal bleeding. None of these patients subsequently required laparotomy or showed hepatobiliary problems at a follow-up examination less than one year later. Five follow-up scans showed varying degrees of resolution. Two patients died of severe head injury, but the liver injury did not contribute to the cause of death. Other patients with more severe blunt liver injury who were treated nonoperatively developed significant complications that required delayed surgery. It seems that patients with limited liver injury diagnosed by CT scan and selected by strictly applied criteria can be managed safely without laparotomy in a setting where rapid evaluation and treatment of any potential complication is available.", "PMC3243084": "Lenses were removed from rabbit eyes using an extracapsular technique. Animals were in three groups; no treatment (NT), post-treatment (PT) and pre- and post-treatment (PPT). Treatment consisted of 2% topical indomethacin given three times a day after surgery, except for the PPT group that received 3 drops on the day prior to surgery and drops at 3 hours and 1 hour before surgery. Prostaglandin levels in ocular tissues and fluids were determined at 7, 14 and 21 days post-surgery. Indomethacin decreased prostaglandin formation in most ocular tissues, and was more effective in the PPT group than in the PT group. The data indicate that topical indomethacin suppresses prostaglandin formation from ocular tissues, and that local prostaglandin release from retina and choroid can provide locally high prostaglandin concentrations, regardless of their source, after lensectomy.", "PMC3930747": "The protein, polysaccharide and phospholipid constituents of Nocardia asteroides have been partially purified and their immunogenicity studied in mice. Humoral and cellular immune responses were demonstrated against a crude cytoplasmic protein fraction (CPF). Two fractions of CPF were prepared on a Sephadex G-200 column; a high mol. wt fraction, fraction-1(F1) was capable of eliciting both types of immune responses, whereas fraction-2(F2) behaved more like a hapten.

The ratio of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol also showed an age-dependent variation, being higher in children than adults. There was a significant difference between boys and girls aged 5-10 yr, but no difference in other subjects. No sex difference was demonstrable in the ratio of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol. Examination of circadian rhythm revealed that 6 beta-hydroxycortisol and cortisol correlated well in children, but showed poor correlation in adults, with a lowered morning peak of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol.", "PMC3168468": "Six animals were used to compare simple interrupted, simple continuous, and stapled techniques for end-to-end rotated small colon anastomoses. Three ponies were evaluated three days after surgery for adhesion formation and luminal diameter at each anastomosis site. Two ponies and one horse were evaluated 14 days after surgery for adhesion formation. All anastomosis sites were examined histologically for alignment of tissue planes, and evidence of inflammation. No single technique was superior in all areas examined. While only three of the nine anastomoses had mild fibrinous adhesions at three days after surgery, all anastomoses had varying degrees of well-organized adhesions by 14 days after surgery. Three days after surgery luminal diameter was most comprised by the simple continuous technique. Although the simple interrupted technique was most consistent in its alignment of tissue planes, it was only slightly better than the simple continuous pattern. Stapled anastomoses were inverted or everted at all sites examined. Adhesion formation was less extensive, and histologic evidence of inflammation was less severe, in stapled anastomoses. The average times required to complete the simple interrupted, simple continuous, and stapled anastomoses were 22, 14, and 8 minutes, respectively.", "PMC2881362": "A study of indices of the cerebral and central hemodynamics in 122 patients with essential hypertension revealed differences in indices of the cerebral blood flow depending on the initial hemodynamic type. It was shown that the assessment of initial indices of the central hemodynamics makes it possible to achieve more favorable hemodynamic rearrangement, and an analysis of the cerebral hemodynamics--to foresee the inclusion of drugs correcting the cerebral blood flow in multimodality antihypertensive therapy.", "PMC3084259": "The problem of the absence of centrioles in cells of the 1182-4 line of Drosophila melanogaster has been reexamined with high voltage electron microscopy. A hypotonic treatment of the cells before fixation allowed a clear recognition of centrioles in 1 micron thick sections. Three different approaches were used to determine the presence of absence of centrioles in a Kc control cell line and in the 1182-4D cell line. 1) 1500 random 0.5 micron thick sections representing the equivalent of 60 whole cells of the 1182-4D line show no centrioles. In contrast, nearly all centrioles of the Kc cells were detected by this examination. 2) In a blind test 10 grids with either Kc or 1182-4D cells were correctly identified by the operator. In Kc cells, 4 to 6 diplosomes were observed by grid square on about 300 cell profiles, while no centrioles were seen in the sections of 1182-4D cells. 3) Complete serial sections 1 micron thick of whole 1182-4D cells were screened for presence or absence of centriole.

Seven patients are presented who developed cranial nerve involvement (facial, spinal accessory) in the midst of a typical attack of neuralgic amyotrophy or who developed either recurrent brachial or brachial and lumbosacral plexopathies. An underlying demyelinating neuropathy was identified in one patient and two patients were herion addicts.

The 60-nm vesicles formed resembled closely transition vesicles in situ considered to function in the transfer of membrane materials between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The transition elements following incubation with ATP and cytosol were resolved by preparative free-flow electrophoresis into fractions of differing electronegativity. The main fraction contained the larger vesicles of the transitional membrane elements, while a less electronegative minor shoulder fraction was enriched in the 60-nm vesicles. If the vesicles concentrated by preparative free-flow electrophoresis were from material previously radiolabeled with [3H]leucine and then added to Golgi apparatus immobilized to nitrocellulose, radioactivity was transferred to the Golgi apparatus membranes. The transfer was rapid (T1/2 of about 5 min), efficient (10-30% of the total radioactivity of the transition vesicle preparations was transferred to Golgi apparatus), and independent of added ATP but facilitated by cytosol. Transfer was specific and apparently unidirectional in that Golgi apparatus membranes were ineffective as donor membranes and endoplasmic reticulum vesicles were ineffective as recipient membranes. Using a heterologous system with transition vesicles from rat liver and Golgi apparatus isolated from guinea pig liver, coalescence of the small endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles with Golgi apparatus membranes was demonstrated using immunocytochemistry. Employed were polyclonal antibodies directed against the isolated rat transition vesicle preparations. When localized by immunogold procedures at the electron microscope level, regions of rat-derived vesicles were found fused with cisternae of guinea pig Golgi apparatus immobilized to nitrocellulose strips. Membrane transfer was demonstrated from experiments where transition vesicle membrane proteins were radioiodinated by the Bolton-Hunter procedure. Additionally, radiolabeled peptide bands not present initially in endoplasmic reticulum appeared following coalescence of the derived vesicles with Golgi apparatus. These bands, indicative of processing, required that both Golgi apparatus and transition vesicles be present and did not occur in incubated endoplasmic reticulum preparations or on nitrocellulose strips to which no Golgi apparatus were added.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC3873296": "Of 300 consecutive patients undergoing primary operation for mitral valve replacement combined with coronary bypass grafting, 22 (7.3%) died in-hospital. Multivariate testing of preoperative and operative descriptors identified radiographic cardiac enlargement, preoperative paced rhythm or atrial fibrillation, 70% or more left main coronary obstruction, and serum bilirubin of more than 2 mg% as factors associated with an increase in in-hospital mortality. Follow-up of the 278 hospital survivors (mean interval 48 months, range 2 to 165 months) documented survival of 85%, 66%, and 31% and an event-free survival of 65%, 46%, and 21% at 2, 5, and 10 postoperative years, respectively. Cox proportional-hazard regression models of late risk implicated in-hospital ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction, and rheumatic or ischemic causes of mitral valve disease in decreasing long-term survival.

For CFU-S mobilization 1.5 mg trypsin, 150 micrograms endotoxin, 1 mg Zymosan per mouse or 5 mg/kg methylprednisolone were injected i.v. and the blood CFU-S level was measured 15 min to several days after provocation. Self-renewal capacity of the mobilized CFU-S showed a 4 to 14-fold increase if compared to that of normal blood CFU-S. This, however, proved to be lower than that of bone marrow CFU-S. This increase in self-renewal capacity was independent of the type of mobilizer, suggesting that CFU-S mobilizing agents, in general, release the same subpopulation of CFU-S. The fairly good correlation between the amount and self-renewal capacity of CFU-S in the circulation supported the assumption that, up to a certain limit, the more CFU-S are mobilized, the better quality stem cells can be obtained for transplantation purposes.", "PMC3425515": "Minocycline hydrochloride was percutaneously instilled into simple renal cysts to prevent recurrence of renal cysts after the puncture and aspiration of cystic fluid. Fifty-six simple renal cysts in 51 patients were punctured with an 18-gauge needle under ultrasonographic guidance, and the cystic fluid was aspirated under fluoroscopic control. A single 100 mg or 200 mg dose of minocycline hydrochloride dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water was instilled through the needle into the renal cyst. The patients were followed up by computed tomographic (CT) scan and ultrasonography 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment. Efficacy was evaluated after 3 months or longer. Of 20 renal cysts instilled with 100 mg of minocycline, efficacy was excellent in 10, good in 6 and poor in 4. Of 22 renal cysts instilled with 200 mg of minocycline, efficacy was excellent in 10, good in 9 and poor in 3. No significant difference was noted between the efficacy rate of 100 mg and 200 mg treatments. Complications attributable to treatment were observed in 15 patients: moderate pain in one, slight pain in 6, slight fever in 8 and slight hematuria in one. Neither severe adverse reactions nor infections were observed in any of the patients.

A total of 2218 primary care physicians evaluated 6669 patients over the study period for efficacy parameters, which included changes in a modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, symptomatology, and daily activity levels. Overall, 63.8% of evaluated patients improved with regard to functional ability, with 19% improving two or more modified NYHA classes. Symptoms of CHF, including dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and orthopnea and signs, including rales and peripheral edema, were reduced in 86% of these patients: 41.5% demonstrated mild improvement; 30.0%, moderate improvement; and 14.5%, marked improvement.

The larger sensilla are at the center of unpigmented patches of skin which are visible in the light microscope, while the smaller sensilla have not been previously described as distinct structures. Electron microscopy, though not light microscopy, shows that the lip sensilla differ markedly from the segmental sensilla of the leech, which have been shown to mediate mechanoreception and photoreception. In particular, the chemosensory lip sensilla contain multiciliated cells with cilia of a uniform length, whereas the segmental sensilla contain uniciliated cells with long, whip-like cilia, as well as multiciliated cells with short, stiff cilia. Thus, the two types of sensilla differ morphologically as well as functionally.

Mutations unique to each array, yet found in more than one subrepeat of the array, are preferentially found in adjacent and alternate subrepeats. The similarity of the DNA sequences of the flanking regions is consistent with a model of homogenization among rDNA gene units by intergenic conversion.

Regional blood flow was measured using the radioactive microsphere method in unanesthetized Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) breathing 21, 10 and 5% O2. In both birds, arterial PO2 was reduced from about 96 Torr during normoxia to about 28 Torr during severe hypoxia. Severe hypocapnic hypoxia produced a change in the pattern of blood flow in ducks; blood flow to some organs increased (brain, adrenal glands, heart, and eyes) while flow to other organs decreased (liver, spleen, small intestine, shell gland). Compared with ducks, bar-headed geese were able to provide higher levels of O2 delivery to their tissues since blood flow to a variety of organs and skeletal muscles was either unchanged or increased during severe hypoxia. The redistribution of blood flow in Pekin ducks during severe hypocapnic hypoxia may help to support large increases in cerebral and coronary blood flow but may also contribute to the development of a metabolic acidosis.", "PMC3486844": "Spontaneous and X-ray-induced mutants at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus have been isolated from V79 Chinese hamster cells and characterized at the biochemical and cytogenetic levels.

Results indicate an immediate increase in MAP and HR above posthemorrhage values in the rats treated with 1 and 5 mg/kg nalbuphine compared with no improvement for the rats in the saline-treated group. The increases in MAP were sustained for periods up to 120 min postadministration of nalbuphine.

Fluorescence polarization was, however, independent of the molar ratio of phospholipid to protein above a molar ratio of 50:1. Resonance energy transfer between FITC-ATPase and EITC-ATPase was also found to be independent of phospholipid:protein ratio. It is suggested therefore that the ATPase is not randomly distributed in the plane of the membrane but rather forms ordered clusters (probably rows of monomers or dimers) on the fluorescence time scale (nanoseconds) even in the presence of a large excess of phospholipid. This organization within the membrane is dependent both on the chemical structure of the phospholipid and on its physical phase.", "PMC2920834": "Squalene epoxide cyclase was extracted from microsomal preparations of rat liver using anionic, cationic and non-ionic microemulsions. The anionic microemulsion was the best with respect to protein solubilisation, extracted cyclase activity and stability of this activity over time. The activity assay showed cyclase activity to be higher in anionic microemulsion than in buffer in the presence of surfactant. Calcium chloride in the anionic microemulsion had a stabilising effect and less total protein seemed to be extracted.", "PMC4010486": "A quantitative analytical method has been developed to analyze methyl esters of blood fatty acids derived from human subjects fed deuterium-labeled fats. The GCMS computer method provides for the analysis of the fed deuterium-labeled fatty acids, the naturally occurring blood fatty acids and new fatty acids formed by chain elongation or shortening of the fed labeled fats. Approximately 20 fatty acids including 16, 17, 18 and 20 carbon chain acids were analyzed with a relative standard deviation of 0.02 at the microgram level and a sensitivity of less than one nanogram. The method uses capillary GC to separate the fatty acid esters and isobutane chemical ionization mass spectrometry with multiple ion detection to determine the isotopic constituents of the GC peaks. The technique provides for the determination of overlapping GC peaks labeled with 2, 4 and 6 deuterium atoms and makes extensive use of computers both for data acquisition and processing.", "PMC3757061": "It is generally held that the cells in all retinal layers bear a cilium during development but there have been controversial reports as to whether the ciliation of the Muller cell persists after birth. The present study of the developing and fully formed adult eye of the teleost Poecilia reticulata reveals that just prior to the formation of the photoreceptors in the embryonic retina, the Muller cell contains only a diplosome. Throughout development the diplosome is seen to migrate apically, always juxtaposed to many microtubules. When the photoreceptors are differentiated and capable of photomechanical movement, the Muller cell in Poecilia bears a cilium situated vitreally to the external limiting membrane. The cilium persists in juvenile and adult retinae in both the light- and dark-adapted state. The functional significance of the cilium in the Muller cell is presently unknown.", "PMC3493521": "The ability of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its analogue, 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2) to protect the rat gastric mucosa from damage has been investigated using the release of enzyme markers as an index of surface cell disruption. These studies have been extended to investigate whether prostanoids can also enhance the rapid repair process which re-establishes epithelial continuity. With low oral doses of PGE2 (100 micrograms kg-1) and dmPGE2 (2.5 micrograms kg-1), the deep necrotic damage induced by intragastric instillation of ethanol was inhibited, yet the mucosal enzyme release (acid phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase) determined in vitro was unaltered. At higher doses, both prostanoids reduced enzyme release, suggesting some preservation or rapid re-establishment of epithelial cell continuity under these conditions. Studies utilizing the gastric chamber indicated that high doses of dmPGE2 (20-40 micrograms kg-1) reduced the changes in potential difference and potassium efflux following challenge with 50% ethanol, and accelerated the rate of recovery of these parameters. Furthermore, a reduced level of epithelial cell discontinuity was determined by histological techniques. Thus, prostanoids not only protect deeper mucosal cells from necrotic damage by local irritants, but may protect the surface cells at higher doses under some conditions, and may enhance the process of epithelial restitution.", "PMC3958442": "Using optimal tissue concentration, supplemented with a thiol-protecting agent, the fetal liver has lower T4 5'-monodeiodinating activity than maternal or neonatal tissue. This is a true deficiency and is not due to deficiency of sulfhydryl groups in fetal tissue as previously suggested. Evidence indicates a dissociation of the neonatal surge of serum T3 and the increase in hepatic T4 to T3 conversion activity, suggesting that the neonatal T3 surge is related more to thyroid gland stimulation than to T4 to T3 conversion in non-thyroid tissues.", "PMC3704604": "The activity of creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase B(CK-B) was measured in 17 patients with injuries to multiple organ systems, including the chest. The patients were closely observed for clinical signs of disturbed cardiac function by means of serial ECG, continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, daily cardiac auscultation, serial chest roentgenography and monitoring of central hemodynamic parameters. No statistically significant difference in CK and CK-B activity was found between the group of patients with normal cardiac function and the group with disturbed cardiac function. The CK-B activity was markedly elevated, but CK-B activity relative to CK activity was normal in both groups during the first 7 days after the trauma. The authors conclude that the significance of these enzymes' serum activity, measured with the immunoinhibition method, is diagnostically doubtful not only as regards cardiac contusions, but also in other cardiopathy preceding or following major trauma.", "PMC3048385": "Sulfated glycoprotein 1 (SGP-1) is one of the abundant proteins secreted by rat Sertoli cells. Pulse-chase labeling shows that SGP-1 is synthesized as a cotranslationally glycosylated 67-kilodalton (kDa) precursor which is posttranslationally modified to a 70-kDa form before secretion to the extracellular space. A plasmid cDNA library was constructed from immunopurified mRNA, and two overlapping clones coding for the entire protein coding sequence were isolated. The cDNAs represent 27 nucleotides of 5' noncoding sequence, 1554 nucleotides of coding sequence, and 594 nucleotides of 3' noncoding sequence. The derived SGP-1 sequence contains 554 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 61,123. Four potential N-glycosylation sites occur within the sequence. An internal region of SGP-1 shows 78% sequence identity with the 67 N-terminal amino acids described for human sulfatide/GM1 activator (SAP-1). Sequence comparisons suggest that SGP-1 is the precursor to sulfatide/GM1 activator; however, the secretion of the protein from Sertoli cells is distinct from the proteolytic processing and lysosomal compartmentalization which have been described for human fibroblasts. The presence of internal sequence similarity suggests that three additional binding sites may occur in SGP-1. Northern blots show similar levels of expression for the 2.6-kilobase SGP-1 mRNA in all tissues examined. The site of SGP-1 synthesis in testis was localized to Sertoli cells by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization.", "PMC3338639": "Treatment, by local depot methylprednisolone injection, of severe anal pain in Crohn's disease not associated with overt sepsis is reported. It has given dramatic relief in 5 patients, but has not been successful in 2 patients where anal disease was in continuity with severe rectal involvement. Treatment has been effective for greater than 1 yr, and no complication of the technique has been found on regular follow-up. When compared with previous attempts at treatment, the beneficial results attained with methylprednisolone injection suggest that the effect is more than a placebo response. Careful patient selection to exclude overt sepsis or severe rectal disease is recommended before proceeding to steroid injection.", "PMC3923797": "Computed tomographic (CT) scans of 19 patients with 10 right and nine left orbital implants were reviewed. Except for orbital soft-tissue swelling due to recent surgery or infection, CT scans obtained with both the implant and prosthesis in place showed relative symmetry of the postoperative side and the native globe. Benign air collections were often associated with either the implant or prosthesis interface or with seating of the prosthesis in the conjunctival fornices. Six patients had either cartilage, silicone, or glass beads placed surgically along the orbital floor to elevate the implants, four having had prior depressed orbital floor fractures. CT identified implant migration in five patients. The orbital prosthesis, usually constructed of solid methylmethacrylate, is fitted over the implant and simulates the appearance of the eye of the contralateral side. The operative anatomy and its relation to the CT appearance of the implant and external prosthesis are reviewed.", "PMC2997047": "Carnitine was administered to a group of patients in shock, and the activities of cytochrome oxidase and succinate cytochrome c reductase in muscle needle biopsies from these patients were compared to those activities present in a non-carnitine treated control group of patients.

The serum concentrations of propranolol enantiomers were measured by h.p.l.c. using a novel chiral stationary phase allowing direct resolution of underivatized propranolol. The (+)-propranolol AUC increased from 412 +/- 223 ng ml-1 h after single doses (0-infinity) to 584 +/- 279 ng ml-1 h at steady-state (0-24 h) (P less than 0.05). Similarly, (-)-propranolol AUC increased from 609 +/- 304 to 777 +/- 370 ng ml-1 h (P less than 0.05). The AUC ratio (-)/(+) was 1.52 +/- 0.36 and 1.32 +/- 0.17 after single doses and steady-state, respectively (P greater than 0.05). Therefore, nonlinear accumulation occurs with both enantiomers although there is a trend for the (-)/(+) ratio to decrease at steady-state.", "PMC3841175": "Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 260 \"apparently healthy\" males and females, aged 20-97, have been investigated for age-related changes in a number of immunological parameters (percent and number of lymphocytes, OKT 4+ and OKT 8+ cells; OKT 4/8 ratio; intensity of fluorescence of OKT 4 and OKT 8 stained cells; membrane fluidity). Data were then reassessed after exclusion of people who did not conform to the SENIEUR PROTOCOL admission criteria of EURAGE (European Economic Community's Concerted Action Program on Aging) in order to investigate whether the differences observed were attributable to underlying disease. A slight decrease in the number and percentage of lymphocytes, OKT 4+ and especially OKT 8+ cells was found. Intensity of fluorescence of OKT 4 and OKT 8 stained cells from the elderly was reduced and may explain the lower percentages. Membrane fluidity was decreased in old persons (over the age of 75); the free cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio in the serum increased up to the age of 75 and then declined, and it did not correlate with decreased membrane fluidity. Exclusion of the 20-60% of the study groups who were not eligible for admission according to the SENIEUR PROTOCOL criteria did not affect these results. The feasability and applicability of the PROTOCOL is discussed.", "PMC2034477": "Prenatal caloric restriction in guinea pigs causes intrauterine growth retardation and reduced neonatal viability and surfactant phospholipid (PL). We report here fetal surfactant levels in this model, and correlate total lung PL with ultrastructural maturation of surfactant type II cells and lamellar bodies (LB). Pregnant guinea pigs were fed ad libitum throughout their 68-d gestation (control), or fed 50% rations from d 45 until term (starved). Fetal lungs were examined at d 55, 60, and 65 for PL content and composition, including disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DPC), and compared with neonates for both groups. Lung lobes were analyzed ultrastructurally in d 65 fetuses for the numerical, volume, and surface densities of type II cells and the volume densities of LB. Prenatal starvation caused significant intrauterine growth retardation at all ages; body and dry lung weights were reduced on d 65 by 26 and 23%, respectively. By d 55 and thereafter, starvation decreased total lung PL by 43-45% but did not alter PL composition. On d 65, the total lung volumes and relative numbers, surface densities, and volumes of type II cells in tissue and the relative volumes of LB within type II cells did not differ by caloric regimen. Thus, starved and control fetuses had similar total volumes of LB per lung (13-15 microL), although starved animals had significantly less lung DPC. Although the total volume of LB per lung correlated well with total lung DPC from d 55 through birth in controls, starvation led to a significant departure from this relationship.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC2194713": "Epidermolytic proteases were partially purified from six strains of Candida albicans, four of which were isolated from patients with cutaneous diseases. Two of the strains exhibited a unique time-course of enzyme production compared to that previously reported, with detectable epidermolytic protease levels being significantly delayed. All epidermolytic proteases had pH and temperature optima of 4-4.5 and 35-37 degrees C, respectively. These conditions are consistent with the microenvironment of human skin, a habitat where an epidermolytic protease would appear to be an important advantage to the yeast. Candida epidermolytic proteases were more active against a substrate of normal human epidermis than that obtained from psoriatic patients. When human epidermis replaced bovine serum albumin as the protein source within the culture medium, the epidermolytic activity of the resultant enzyme was reduced by 9 and 25% for normal and psoriatic epidermis substrates, respectively. The proteases were found to contain major protein bands at 42 and 66 kDa. The ability of these same Candida strains to adhere to human epidermal cells was studied and found to be optimal at 35-37 degrees C within neutral pH values. Pepstatin, bovine brain gangliosides, and convalescent human serum all interfered with the adherence of the yeast to epidermal cells. A higher yeast-epidermal-cell adherence for Candida was demonstrated on normal rather than psoriatic epidermal cells, and after treating the cells with partially purified Candida protease.", "PMC3364549": "We determined the in situ elemental composition of alveolar type II cells (ATII) and lamellar bodies (LB) with electronprobe microanalysis (EPMA) of freeze-dried unstained cryosections (100-200 nm) obtained from lungs frozen in anesthetized rats. Twenty-nine ATII from seven rats were subjected to EPMA. Cytoplasmic (Cyto) composition was the following (in mmol/kg dry wt, mean +/- SE, n = 30): 136 +/- 14.1 Na, 60 +/- 2.8 Mg, 549 +/- 34.8 P, 278 +/- 10.5 S, 158 +/- 7.3 Cl, 525 +/- 26.4 K, and 6.6 +/- 0.9 Ca. LB composition was the following (n = 66): 44 +/- 4.0 Na, 7.9 +/- 0.8 Mg, 1,060 +/- 25.0 P, 79 +/- 4.8 S, 64 +/- 3.6 Cl, 114 +/- 4.1 K, and 30 +/- 0.9 Ca. P and S concentrations were consistent with previous biochemical determinations of phospholipid and protein content of isolated LBs. LBs contain significantly more Ca and less Mg than Cyto. Ca correlated significantly with LB P but not S concentration, and the reported low Ca binding affinity of similar phospholipid mixtures implies a high LB free Ca concentration. Ca was significantly higher in apical and exocytotic LBs compared with those in the perinuclear region. Differences between LB and Cyto monovalent ion concentrations are not entirely due to the difference in hydration revealed by significantly lower K-Cl ratios in LBs. The relative excess of Cl and Ca in LB suggests that these ions may be distributed by active transport systems known to be present in the Golgi apparatus and in Golgi-derived organelles of other cell types.", "PMC3351436": "Cachexia is a potentially lethal syndrome of unknown etiology characterized by anorexia, weight loss, and protein wasting that frequently complicates the treatment of chronic inflammation and cancer. Cachectin/TNF was isolated during the search for a humoral mediator of cachexia and found to stimulate the breakdown of energy stores from adipocytes and myocytes in vitro, but the chronic effects of the monokine in vivo are not known. Sublethal doses of recombinant human cachectin administered twice daily for 7-10 d caused cachexia in rats, as evidenced by reduced food intake, weight loss, and depletion of whole-body lipid and protein stores. Significant anemia is also observed and found to be the result of decreased red blood cell mass, not expanded plasma volume. Leukocytosis and histopathological evidence of tissue injury and inflammation are observed in several organs, including omentum, liver, spleen, and heart. These data suggests that the exposure of the normal host to cachectin is capable of inducing a pathophysiological syndrome of cachexia, anemia, and inflammation similar to that observed during inflammatory states or malignancy.", "PMC2553568": "PK 11195 (or 52028 RP; 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide), an antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors which are coupled to calcium channels, was administered to 10 healthy volunteers in order to study the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular effects of the drug. PK 11195 was randomly administered intravenously (10 mg) and orally in three single dosages (100, 200 and 400 mg). Placebo was only given orally. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at rest and during exercise tests which were performed at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 h after dosing on each study day. The results showed that after IV administration, PK 11195 was rapidly distributed in two or three open compartments. Its elimination T 1/2 was short (3.7 +/- 3.0 h) with high interindividual variability. After oral ingestion the pharmacokinetics of PK 11195 were linear over the range of 100-400 mg single oral doses with a stable absolute bioavailability (33%). T 1/2 elimination was prolonged (7-12 h) and the presence of secondary increases in plasma concentration at 8-10 h and 22-24 h after drug absorption may have been related to enterohepatic cycling. No unchanged PK 11195 could be detected in urine. PK 11195 did not significantly modify heart rate and blood pressure at rest or during exercise and was well tolerated by the subjects. These data suggest a high inter-individual variability in PK 11195 disposition with extensive metabolism in normal exercising volunteers.", "PMC1636434": "Severe glomerulonephritis was induced successfully in (B10 x DBA/2)F1 (BDF1) mice by injection of parental DBA/2 lymphoid cells.

Electron microscopical examination demonstrated electron dense deposits first in the mesangial matrix, then in the subepithelium compatible with immune complex glomerulonephritis. Subendothelial deposits were not observed. Immunofluorescent study revealed IgG deposition in the capillary wall and IgM in the mesangium early in the process. As the lesion progressed, both IgG and IgM were present in the mesangial area and along the capillary wall. Some glomeruli showed segmental mesangiolysis, suggesting that altered mesangial cells have a role in the development of glomerular change, which together with rise in serum anti-DNA antibody titer suggest that autoantibodies promote the glomerular lesions in this model system.", "PMC3741900": "We consider the description of a nonlinear stochastic transduction in terms of its input/output distribution.

The enzymic activities involved in the formation and breakdown of long-chain acyl-CoA were both increased in the animals fed the semisynthetic diet, compared to pellet-fed control animals. Thus, the specific palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activity increased slightly in both the mitochondrial (1.4-fold) and the microsomal (1.6-fold) fractions. In the peroxisome-enriched fraction the activity was increased (about 2.6-fold) only on addition of linoleic acid to the diet. The data are consistent with an increased catabolism of long-chain fatty acids by a peroxisomal and a mitochondrial pathway. Thus, the total carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity increased 2-fold in the mitochondrial fraction, and was partly prevented by added linoleic acid. Peroxisomal beta-oxidation activity was also increased (about 7-fold) in livers of PHFO-fed rats, but did not change when linoleic acid was added. The PHFO-fed rats also revealed elevated capacity for hydrolysis of palmitoyl-CoA in both the mitochondrial (2.4-fold) and the cytosolic (2.0-fold) fractions and the latter was almost completely and selectively prevented by added linoleic acid. The s values of mitochondria and peroxisomes varied with the dietary regime, and some of the observed changes in the specific activities of the fatty acid metabolizing enzymes with multiple subcellular localization can be explained as an effect of changes in the s values of the organelles. Thus, the s value of mitochondria increased 1.8-fold as a result of PHFO feeding, but was fully prevented by linoleic acid in the diet. On the other hand, the s values of peroxisomes decreased by about 50% on feeding a PHFO diet, and by about 25% with added linoleic acid.", "PMC2715216": "The timing is opportune for this expansion of hospital nurses' practice into the home. First, more home health agencies are aligning themselves with hospitals, making cooperative arrangements easier. Second, in response to the nursing shortage crisis, institutions are developing share governance models that offer nurses more autonomy and control over their schedules, affording them the opportunities to accommodate home visits into their day. If these visits are reimbursable through a third party payer, the nurse and the home health agency could receive payment if the hospital nurse either had a direct contract with the agency or belonged to a temporary staffing agency (registry) from which the home health agency could request services. If, however, the hospital nurse is unable to follow the patient into the home, that nurse could make a referral to a home health agency. For example, the hospital nurse would communicate the patient's treatment plan to the home health agency, request any necessary ancillary services (e.g., physical therapy or home health aides), and provide any education and training necessary for the community health nurse to provide hands-on care to patients with complex or high-technology needs. The home health agency could also employ special high-technology nurses for these types of cases. The use of this alternative, however, reduces the continuity of care aspect of the nursing discharge concept. The concept of nursing discharge solves several problems.

To meet this need, I have provided a brief overview of the literature on osteoporosis. The structure and dynamic nature of bone are discussed.

Since the relation between these dimensions and the general term 'pain' is not known, two experiments developed a verbal descriptor scale of painfulness and compared the sensitivity of this scale to pharmacological manipulations used previously with scales of sensory intensity and unpleasantness. In exp. I, 20 subjects used cross-modality matching to both handgrip force and tone duration to quantify the amount of pain implied by verbal descriptor phrases such as 'slightly painful,' 'somewhat painful' and 'very painful.' Ratio scales of relative magnitude for each individual were highly correlated within subjects (mean r = 0.92) and between a scale from each individual and a combined scale from others in the group (mean r = 0.93). These correlations indicate agreement between individual scales; an individual's scale values were predicted equally well by that individual or by a group of similar persons. In exp. II, 4 groups of 10 subjects rated the magnitude of painful tooth pulp sensations by choosing pain descriptors from randomized lists. Seven electrical stimuli spaced between individually determined pain threshold and tolerance values were delivered in random sequence 6 times before and after double-blind intravenous infusions of placebo, 0.11 mg/kg diazepam, 0.66 microgram/kg fentanyl or a combination of the diazepam and fentanyl doses. Mean responses were reduced significantly after all active drugs but not after placebo.

ICUs admitted fewer patients with severe chronic failing health (N.Z. 8.7%, U.S. 18%) and following elective surgery (N.Z. 8%, U.S. 40%). Approximately half the N.Z. admissions were for trauma, drug overdose, and asthma while these diagnoses accounted for 11% of U.S. admissions. When controlled for differences in case mix and severity of illness, hospital mortality rates in N.Z. were comparable to the U.S. This study demonstrates substantial differences in patient selection among these U.S. and N.Z. ICUs that have equal technical and manpower capabilities and provide similar high-quality intensive care. Physicians from both countries justify the differences on medical criteria; however, both approaches to patient selection cannot be optimal. Additional outcome comparisons between acutely ill patients treated in the U.S. and N.Z. could help refine ICU selection criteria and improve the precision of clinical decision-making.", "PMC3080404": "The transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli trp-linked opp operon that encodes the oligopeptide permease was investigated by using lambda plac Mu51-generated lac operon fusions. Synthesis of beta-galactosidase by strains harboring oppA-lac, oppB-lac, and oppD-lac fusions occurred at a basal level when the fusion-containing strains were grown in minimal medium. The addition of L-leucine or L-alanine to exponentially growing, aerobic cultures or shifting the aerobic fusion-containing strains to anaerobic growth medium increased the synthesis of beta-galactosidase from all opp-lac fusions. When transcription of the opp operon was induced by L-leucine, the differential rate of beta-galactosidase synthesis from each opp-lac fusion increased 8- to 10-fold; this increased rate of lacZ expression from the opp-lac fusions resulted in a 5- to 6-fold increase in total beta-galactosidase activity after maximum expression was achieved. Importantly, when F'123 derivatives harboring independently isolated E. coli opp-lac operon fusions were introduced into E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the data clearly demonstrated that the E. coli opp operon was expressed identically and responded to the same transcriptional regulatory signals in both E. coli and S. typhimurium. A comparison of beta-galactosidase synthesis by E. coli strains harboring an opp-lac operon fusion and either an oppE+ locus or an oppE mutation demonstrated that the reduction in peptide transport produced by the oppE mutation does not result from a decrease in the level of opp operon transcription.", "PMC3944435": "Experience with 49 cases of Dupuytren's disease treated by the open palm method and followed for an average of 5 years is reported. This method permits excision of the involved fascia while minimizing early postoperative morbidity associated with the surgical management of this condition. There were no cases of wound necrosis, hematoma, or infection with this technique, and all wounds closed spontaneously within 3 to 5 weeks. Long-term follow-up, however, revealed a significant rate of recurrence (32%) and extension (48%), as well as flexion loss at one or more joints in 41% of involved hands. While helpful in the early care of these patients, the open palm method does not modify the long-term results in Dupuytren's disease, which is a pervasive condition without simple surgical solution.", "PMC4351623": "In a survey of virus cross-infection in paediatric wards there were 15 cross-infections due to respiratory syncytial (R.S.) virus and 16 due to influenza A, both during a four-month period, and 19 due to parainfluenza viruses over two years. The illnesses produced by these infections acquired in hospital ranged from a slight cold to severe pneumonia: in 17 of the 50 cases the illness involved the lower respiratory tract. A measure of cross-infection frequency in the form of a \"cross-infection rate\" has been devised, and it is suggested that this can be used to assess the influence of factors such as ward design and admission policy on the frequency of cross-infection.", "PMC3531394": "Klebocin, a bacteriocin produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae 158, was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate fractionation and sequential DEAE-Sephacel and Sephadex G-150 column chromatography.

Cerebral nuclei of diabetic rats maintained for 6 weeks were less susceptible to micrococcal nuclease digestion compared with control rats. Insulin treatment reversed diabetes-related changes in nuclease digestion kinetics. There were no changes in the kinetics of digestion in hepatic nuclei. The reduced digestibility of cerebral DNA in diabetes could not be attributed to altered DNA fluorescence spectra, or altered distribution of most abundant chromatin proteins that were either solubilized or that remained insoluble immediately following nuclease digestion. It is concluded that chronic, uncontrolled hyperglycemia can alter chromatin structure of some tissues in vivo, and this change is probably related to subtle alterations in DNA-protein interactions.", "PMC2801990": "Implantation of micromanometer-tipped catheters into dogs and other animals for invasive high-fidelity blood pressure measurement is expensive and impractical. We have devised an implantable sheath that allows insertion of the transducer each time the animal is to be studied. This eliminates animal-inflicted damage and the need for multiple transducers if several animals are to be instrumented concurrently. The sheath is coextruded from hard and soft forms of polyurethane to form a soft, flexible, thrombus-resistant tubing with a hard thin inner lining having a low coefficient of friction. This allows chronic implantation of the sheath into the heart and major vessels with minimal trauma, yet enables a transducer to be advanced through a sheath only slightly larger than the transducer itself without the frictional resistance common to other soft tubing. The sheath can be tapered for ease of implantation into vessels or curved to the appropriate angle for implantation into the heart. Our polyurethane sheath is a versatile, convenient, and inexpensive alternative to chronic instrumentation with transducers for high-fidelity pressure measurement.", "PMC3261145": "The growth and development of a child with a 49,XYYYY karyotype is reported.

Periorbital cellulitis is well-documented as a more common infectious process limited to the eyelids in the preseptal region. In contrast, orbital cellulitis represents a more severe, but less common, infection of the orbit posterior to the septum with or without subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess, or cavernous sinus thrombosis. A retrospective review of the clinical and laboratory data of 137 cases of orbital and periorbital cellulitis was performed. Periorbital cellulitis was documented in 98 cases (71%), in contrast to orbital cellulitis which was noted in 39 (28%) patients. All patients with orbital cellulitis received intravenous antibiotics, however, surgical therapy was necessary for progression of orbital cellulitis in 49% of patients. The majority of patients underwent incision and drainage of an abscess in the orbit. Complications as a result of orbital cellulitis occurred in nine (23%) of the patients. A distinction is made between the clinical entity of periorbital cellulitis and orbital cellulitis. Separating these clinical entities on the basis of physical examination and radiographic studies is important because the medical and surgical management of these two disease processes is different.", "PMC1475617": "To determine whether omeprazole eradicates Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric antrum, six adolescents and one adult with H. pylori colonization of the antrum were entered into a clinical, open trial of medical therapy. Histologic evidence of antral gastritis and three complementary methods to document H. pylori colonization of the stomach (silver stain, urease testing, and culture of antrum) were obtained before and after an 8-week course of omeprazole. In vitro susceptibility to omeprazole and restriction endonuclease analysis were performed on H. pylori isolates obtained from patients before and after omeprazole therapy. Each of the seven patients treated with omeprazole had continued active inflammation in the antrum and one or more features indicative of persisting H. pylori colonization. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and DNA fingerprints of H. pylori isolated after therapy were identical to those of the pre-treatment bacterial isolates in each of the four subjects examined. We conclude that omeprazole therapy alone did not eradicate H. pylori infection of the human antrum. Continued bacterial colonization was not related to either acquired bacterial resistance to the drug or reinfection of the stomach with a different H. pylori strain.", "PMC3675669": "Blood derived products carry the risk of virus transmission, especially for the hepatitis B virus (HBV), non-A/non-B virus(es) (NANBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

These proteins include erythropoietin and various colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), one of which is granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Recently, both murine and human GM-CSF have been purified to homogeneity and complementary DNAs encoding them have been cloned. Although the in vitro activity of recombinant human GM-CSF has been investigated intensively, little is known about the functional activity of this protein in vivo. There is strong evidence that colony-stimulating activities produced by various human and murine tumour tissues and cell lines can stimulate granulopoiesis in mice, as can human urinary extracts. A partially purified preparation of human urinary colony-stimulating factor, however, proved only marginally effective in stimulating granulopoiesis in humans. All these studies suffer from the lack of a homogeneous preparation of colony-stimulating factor. It has recently been shown that recombinant murine multi-CSF or interleukin-3 can stimulate haematopoiesis in mice in vivo. Large-scale production of recombinant human GM-CSF now permits us to examine its effects in vivo using a primate model. We find that the continuous infusion of GM-CSF in healthy monkeys rapidly elicits a dramatic leukocytosis and a substantial reticulocytosis. A similar effect has been observed in one pancytopenic, immunodeficient rhesus macaque. These results suggest that GM-CSF could prove useful in several clinical situations.", "PMC4066711": "The coupling between depolarization-induced calcium entry and neurotransmitter release was studied in rat brain neurons in culture. The endogenous dopamine content of the cells was determined by high performance liquid chromatography utilizing electrochemical detection. The amount of dopamine in unstimulated cells was found to be about 16 ng/mg of protein. Depolarization of the neurons by elevated K+ caused a Ca2+-dependent release of dopamine from the cells. Following 1 min of depolarization, the cellular dopamine content and the amount of [3H]dopamine in cells preloaded with the radioactive transmitter were reduced by 35%. The release of [3H]dopamine by the neurons was measured at 1.5-6-s intervals by a novel rapid dipping technique. Depolarization in the presence of Ca2+ (1.8 mM) enhanced the rate of neurotransmitter release by 90-fold (0.072 +/- 0.003 s-1) over the basal release in the presence of Ca2+. The evoked release consisted of a major rapidly terminating phase (t1/2 = 9.6 s) which comprised about 40% of the neurotransmitter content of the cells and a subsequent slower efflux (t1/2 = 575 s) which was observed during following prolonged depolarization. Predepolarization of the cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ did not affect the kinetics of the evoked release. The fast evoked release could be re-elicited in the cells after 20 min \"rest\" in reference low K+ buffer. The effects of varying the extracellular Ca2+ concentrations on the kinetic parameters of the evoked release were measured. The amount of neurotransmitter released during the fast kinetic phase was very sensitive to the external Ca2+ (from 0% in the absence of Ca2+ to 40% of the neurotransmitter content at Ca2+ 0.3 mM). The rate constant of the fast release did not depend on the extracellular Ca2+, whereas the rate constant of the slow release increased from 0.0004 +/- 0.0001 s-1 at 0.4 mM Ca2+ to 0.0012 +/- 0.0002 s-1 at 0.8 mM Ca2+. The fast evoked release was inhibited by verapamil in a concentration-dependent manner. By contrast, verapamil enhanced the basal and the slow release independent of the presence of Ca2+. Both fast and slow phases of the evoked release were blocked by Co2+. Addition of Co2+ within the first 6 s after the onset of depolarization inhibited the fast release but failed to do so when added later on.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC3529910": "The electrophysiologic effects and clinical efficacy of mexiletine used alone or in combination with class IA agents were studied in 35 patients with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation refractory to nonexperimental antiarrhythmic agents. At baseline before therapy, all patients had inducible VT by programmed stimulation (1 to 3 extrastimuli) and frequent (at least 30/hour) ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) during Holter monitoring. Mexiletine therapy was effective by programmed stimulation (VT no longer inducible or 15 or less beats) in 8 and ineffective in 27 patients. Twenty patients were discharged with mexiletine (14 of whom took an additional class IA agent). The discharge regimen was effective by programmed stimulation in 6 of these 20 patients. In 14 patients the discharge regimen was ineffective by programmed stimulation, but all patients had a marked reduction of ventricular ectopic activity (at least 83% reduction of VPCs and abolition of non sustained VT). During the follow-up period of 18 +/- 13 months (mean +/- standard deviation), 4 patients had recurrences (3 with an ineffective regimen by programmed stimulation and 1 with an effective regimen by programmed stimulation). Arrhythmia-free survival rates at 12 and 24 months were 86% and 77%, as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, in patients with an ineffective regimen by programmed stimulation, and 80% and 80% in patients with an effective regimen by programmed stimulation (p = 0.979 by log rank test).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3297556": "The lymphatic filarial parasites, Brugia and Wuchereria, continue to present an immunological puzzle, particularly with respect to the development of natural resistance or damaging disease. We have approached this question by examining humoral responses to a few defined antigens of selected interest from these parasites, using sera from each category in the spectrum of filarial disease. Many antigens, such as the major adult surface protein of Mr 29,000 (29K), appear to be recognized at all stages of infection, but two components show interesting patterns of differential recognition. A triplet of proteins of Mr 65-75K associated with the microfilarial surface is preferentially bound by serum from patent microfilaraemic infections, whereas an unrelated 75K protein has been found to react only with antibody from amicrofilaraemic individuals.

TPB derivatives in which all four phenyl groups were substituted with fluorine, chlorine or trifluoromethyl were much more toxic than the unsubstituted compound, the effect increasing dramatically with increasing size of substituents. These observations suggest that the toxicity of these hydrophobic ions is determined mainly by their size and possibly also by the chemical inductivity of their substituent groups. The order of the toxicities of these ions was in fair agreement with literature values for their translocation rates across artificial bilayers. Incubation times of 3 h were used as standard, longer incubations (up to 48 h) showed that the number of cells affected by low doses of TPB increased with the logarithm of time after the first hour of incubation. Although measurements of the percentage of cells showing co-field rotation showed that controls were not adversely affected by incubations as long as 9 h, rotation spectra showed that some cells suffer loss of internal conductivity during extended incubations. Decrease of the pH of the incubation medium, or inclusion of high concentrations of NaCl or KCl, potentiated the effects of these hydrophobic ions. The toxicity developed slowly, and the sensitivity of the assay was only very weakly dependent on the cell suspension density.", "PMC4051120": "A combination of heparin and dihydroergotamine mesylate (Heparin-Dihydergot) has been shown to be more effective than either of these drugs alone in preventing postoperative venous thromboembolism.

Phlebograms obtained after administration of 0.5 mg of dihydroergotamine showed marked constriction of the tibial and soleal veins with a significant reduction in the mean diameter of the femoral vein. The effect on the coagulation mechanism was assessed in 28 patients. Blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein during varicose vein operations.

We believe that the available data unequivocally support the concept that in those patients with HCM who have left ventricular outflow gradients measured at catheterization (and who have associated marked SAM) a mechanical impediment to forward flow, and thus true obstruction to left ventricular outflow, does exist. Most importantly, the gradient has critical clinical implications by virtue of the markedly elevated intraventricular systolic pressures associated with it. These chronically elevated pressures are potentially detrimental to the left ventricle (a view held even by investigators opposed to the term \"obstruction\"), by virtue of increasing systolic myocardial wall stress and myocardial oxygen demand. Therefore, surgical abolition of the obstruction and normalization of these pressures remains an important and rational therapeutic objective in those severely symptomatic patients who have obstruction to left ventricular outflow and who have failed to benefit from drug therapy.", "PMC3285199": "Shortly following the inception of genetic toxicology as a distinct discipline within toxicology, questions arose regarding the type and number of tests needed to classify a chemical as a mutagenic hazard or as a potential carcinogen. To some degree the discipline separated into two sub-specialties, (1) genetic risk assessment and (2) cancer prediction since data from experimental oncology also supports the existence of a genotoxic step in tumor initiation. The issue of which and how many tests continued to be debated, but is now focused more tightly around two independent phenomena. Tier or sequential testing was initially proposed as a logical and cost-effective method, but was discarded on the basis that the lower tier tests appeared to have too many false responses to force or exclude further testing of the test agent. Matrix (battery) testing was proposed for screening on the hypothesis that combinations of endpoints and multiple phylogenetic target organisms were needed to achieve satisfactory predictability. As the results from short-term test 'validation' studies for carcinogen prediction and evaluations of EPA's Gene-Tox data accumulated, it became obvious that qualitative differences remained between predictive and definitive tests and by assembling different combinations of short-term assays investigators did not appear to resolve the lack of concordance. Recent trends in genetic toxicology testing have focused on mathematical models for test selection, and standardized systems for multi-test data assessment.", "PMC3045798": "The clinical relevance of the neurobiochemical and pharmacological properties of the new generation of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is reviewed and discussed. The most distinctive characteristics of these drugs are the selectivity, competitive nature and reversibility of their MAO-inhibiting action. The most selective MAO-A inhibitors are moclobemide and brofaromine, with ratios between their MAO-A and MAO-B inhibiting potency (estimated in in vitro assays) of 1: greater than or equal to 1000 and 1:500, respectively, whereas the least selective drug is cimoxatone with a ratio of 1:66. If in vitro findings are considered, the most potent MAO-A inhibitor seems to be cimoxatone and the least potent toloxatone. After oral administration, however, cimoxatone, brofaromine and moclobemide appear to be about equally effective in inhibiting brain MAO-A. All these drugs are short acting and their MAO-inhibiting action is reversible within 24 h or, in the case of brofaromine, 48 h. Due to the selectivity and reversibility of the MAO-A inhibition, they were found to be less likely to induce large increases in the pressor responses to tyramine, both in animals and in man. In patients treated with 150 mg/day for 4 weeks, brofaromine, which appears to be the best-characterized drug in this respect, produced about a 4-fold increase in sensitivity to tyramine. Although the clinical antidepressant efficacy of these drugs remains to be confirmed in more extensive studies, based on their neurobiochemical and pharmacological properties, clear advantages in respect to their side-effect profiles are to be expected in comparison with the classical MAOIs.", "PMC3407199": "The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying migraine, 21 patients with migraine, 21 healthy controls and a group of 21 asthmatics participated in the investigation.

Similar incubation of the double-labeled molecule with K562 cells did not lead to the dissociation of the two labels.

Before random assignment, data on the infants were stratified according to low-weight (500 to 999 g) or high-weight (1000 to 1500 g) subgroups. Cranial sonography was used to document the absence of PVH-IVH before enrollment and the occurrence of PVH-IVH during the 7-day protocol. Indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg, or placebo was administered before 12 hours of age and at 24, 48, and 72 hours of age. Five patients receiving indomethacin and six receiving placebo were withdrawn before completion of the study. In the remaining 111 patients, the indomethacin and placebo groups were comparable with respect to gestational ages, maternal complications, Apgar scores, ventilatory requirements, complications of prematurity, and mortality rate. PVH-IVH developed in six of 56 infants who received indomethacin and 11 of 55 infants who received placebo (P = 0.174). Analysis of the individual strata showed that the indomethacin-treated infants in the low-weight subgroup sustained a higher mortality rate (11/17 vs 3/16; P = 0.008) without a reduction in the incidence of PVH-IVH. Infants in the indomethacin-treated high-weight subgroup demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of PVH-IVH (2/39 vs 8/39; P = 0.04), but the frequency of high-grade hemorrhages was comparable for both indomethacin- and placebo-treated groups. In summary, the prophylactic administration of intravenous indomethacin for the prevention of PVH-IVH cannot be recommended for infants less than 1000 g. In preterm infants between 1000 and 1500 g birth weight, indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of PVH-IVH.", "PMC3983907": "It has been previously proposed that platelet stimulation may involve two platelet-thrombin complexes: an initial platelet-thrombin complex (P-T) which is converted to an activated platelet-thrombin complex (P*-T). By using the release of radioactive serotonin as a measure of thrombin stimulation, we have demonstrated that under appropriate conditions, a hirudin sensitive and a hirudin insensitive complex can be differentiated. At short platelet-thrombin preincubation times (0-2 minutes) at 4 degrees C, in a buffer containing 18.7 mM phosphate, added hirudin almost completely inhibited the release of radioactive serotonin obtained upon subsequent warming to 37 degrees C (only the hirudin sensitive complex exists). If platelets were preincubated with thrombin for longer periods of time (30 minutes), hirudin became less effective in inhibiting the release obtained upon subsequent warming to 37 degrees C. The same results were obtained whether or not the platelets were washed after incubation at 4 degrees C and before warming to 37 degrees C. We postulate that this change in hirudin sensitivity may reflect a slow conversion of the first platelet-thrombin complex (P-T) to an activated platelet-thrombin complex (P*-T) which can undergo release upon warming. This transition appears to be much faster in acetatetris buffer since at short platelet-thrombin incubation times at 4 degrees C, added hirudin had little or no effect on the release obtained upon warming to 37 degrees C. The difference in the ability of hirudin to inhibit thrombin-induced release in the two buffers was shown to depend upon the presence of phosphate and on variations in ionic strength, and not due to a change in the inhibition constant (Ki) for hirudin.", "PMC4083606": "After a single IV or IM dose of a long-acting oxytetracycline (OTC) preparation, serum concentrations were determined at various times in the ring-necked pheasant, great horned owl, and Amazon parrot. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including serum half-life (t1/2) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd) were calculated from the OTC concentration-time curves for each species and route of administration. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) were found in the t1/2 and Vd parameters between species and routes of administration. Dosage regimens to maintain minimum OTC concentration of 5 micrograms/ml of serum were calculated from the t 1/2 and Vd values obtained, using steady-state pharmacokinetics. In the pheasant, the calculated mean IV dose was 23 mg/kg of body weight every 6 hours, whereas the mean IM dose was 43 mg/kg every 24 hours. The mean IM dose was 16 mg/kg every 24 hours for the owl and 58 mg/kg every 24 hours for the parrot.

Faults in the rate of amidopyrine n-demethylation and aniline n-hydroxylation correlate with the intensification of spontaneous peroxidation of lipids and activation of proteolytic processes in ischemia.

The effect of vasopressin is both time- and concentration-dependent. Maximal levels of both phosphatidyl-choline hydrolysis and accumulation of diacylglycerol are observed between 10 and 20 min after treatment with vasopressin. Effects are maximal at vasopressin concentrations of 100 ng/ml; the ED50 for vasopressin-stimulated phosphatidyl-choline hydrolysis is approximately 0.7 ng/ml.

In all cases, satisfactory quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRRs) were found and the data suggest that the differences in the retention behaviour of octadecylsilicas used in this study are silanophilic interactions which, together with solvophobic interaction contribute to the retention of these eluites. Further analysis showed that QSRRs of sterically crowded molecules must take into account reduced surface area available for binding. The retention data obtained with use of aqueous tetrahydrofuran as mobile phase failed to give rise to satisfactory QSRRs. This was attributed to selective solvation of eluite by tetrahydrofuran and/or nearly equipotent binding of eluite and tetrahydrofuran to stationary phase.", "PMC3083700": "Net renal tubular secretion of endogenous beta-amino acids (taurine, beta-alanine, beta-aminoisobutyric acid) and their endogenous analogue (L-cysteic acid) was revealed in the olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, and in the garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis, by renal clearance methods. The net secretory rates ranged from 16 to 795 nmol X kg-1 X h-1, with taurine being secreted at the highest rates. These rates of secretion are comparable to those observed in marine fish, the only other group of vertebrates exhibiting renal tubular secretion of L-amino acids under physiological conditions. However, only some snakes (8-58%) demonstrated net tubular secretion; the others (0-58%) showed net tubular reabsorption of these amino acids. Net tubular secretion was consistently observed whenever the filtered load of the amino acid was low, and net reabsorption was apparent whenever the filtered load was high; the two variables being significantly correlated. An analysis of the net amino acid transport rates, both secretory and reabsorptive, as a function of the filtered load suggests that in snakes the beta-amino acids are reabsorbed and secreted at discrete tubular sites, with the secretory sites located beyond the major reabsorptive sites. Taurine, beta-alanine, and L-cysteic acid appear to share a common transport system in the snake renal tubule cells.", "PMC4096216": "The method of repeated measures was applied to a group of 4 exotropes in order to test the hypothesis that irregularities in their day-to-day longitudinal horopter findings were caused by random horizontal vergence eye movements. Determining the mean of several sets of replications smoothed out the horopter. Horopters in exotropes appear to be very similar to those found in normal binocular subjects.", "PMC3436726": "The cricoid split operation is a well established treatment for subglottic stenosis; the success rate for this procedure is approximately 77%. The management of patients who fail this operation has traditionally involved tracheostomy followed by delayed laryngotracheoplasty. We have treated 22 patients using the cricoid split--6 required subsequent tracheostomy. Two-thirds of the patients with a tracheostomy have been unable to be decannulated, even after laryngotracheoplasty. In contrast, 3 patients had repeat cricoid split operations instead of tracheostomy. All 3 of these children have had no further problems with their airway. The authors propose that in patients who fail the cricoid split operation one consider repeating the procedure instead of performing a tracheostomy.", "PMC3812048": "Seventeen detoxified alcoholics were randomly assigned to a waiting list group or an inpatient treatment group. The waiting list group members were informed that they had to wait some time until there was a vacant place. By their discharge from the Detoxification Unit they were told to complete a self-report form every day with regards to drinking, working, sleeping home and use of disulfiram orally. Two weeks later they had an outpatient appointment in which the self-reports were collected and reviewed. This was repeated once for everybody so that they all had to wait 4 weeks. By discharge from further inpatient treatment, the inpatient treatment group was instructed to record the same four behaviors daily as the waiting list group did, and they, too, got an outpatient appointment with a 2 week interval. No significant differences between the groups were observed in the three main variables of drinking, working and sleeping home, but the waiting list group used significantly more disulfiram than the inpatient treatment group.", "PMC3963925": "Pericardial patching to enlarge the right ventricular outflow tract is often required in congenital cardiac surgery in lesions such as tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, pulmonary stenosis, and pulmonary artery repair following removal of a palliative pulmonary artery band. A method of simplifying the attachment of the pericardial patch onto the right ventricular outflow tract is described.", "PMC2952596": "The total DNA per cell and DNA synthetic cycle phases were determined by flow cytometry in five Candida isolates including three species: Candida albicans 208R1, Candida tropicalis ATCC 750, and Candida parapsilosis 970, 3138, and ATCC 22019. The cells were prepared for flow cytometry by fixation in Carnoy fixative followed by staining with mithramycin. Marked but stable and reproducible inter- and intraspecific differences in total DNA per cell of stationary-phase cultures were found which did not correlate directly to diphenylamine estimates of the same parameter. This discrepancy was resolved by mathematically converting flow cytometry data into diphenylamine data. The reason for the discrepancy was found in studies of the DNA synthetic cycle of these yeasts: a large but isolate-specific variable proportion of the population is arrested in the S and G2-M phases after the culture passes from exponential to stationary phase. Histograms of exponential-growth-phase Candida isolates demonstrate that the majority of the population is in the G2-M phase of the DNA synthetic cycle. The DNA content of the C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis isolates studied is as high as or higher than that of C. albicans. Extranuclear fluorescent particles were observed in the C. tropicalis isolate. No equivalent particles could be detected in the other four Candida isolates. The nature of the particles is unknown.", "PMC3825506": "Cytotoxic brain edema has been produced in rats by subacute intoxication with triethyltin (TET). Some animals were allowed to recover spontaneously, others were post-treated with an extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGB) for 1 to 4 weeks, beginning 3 days after intoxication was stopped. The time course of the resolution of the edema was studied biochemically and morphologically by light microscopy, histochemistry and electron microscopy (EM). Morphometric evaluation showed that the spontaneous reabsorption of TET-induced edema was very slow: it was evident only 2 weeks after ending TET administration and it required more than 4 weeks to be completed. EGB therapy markedly decreased the vacuolation, as well as the abnormal levels of water and sodium contents, 1 week after beginning the treatment. Less influence of EGB was observed at the later stages. During spontaneous recovery, astroglial cells in the edematous white matter of TET-intoxicated animals showed short and swollen processes containing few organelles, low levels of NADH- and NADPH-tetrazolium reductase activities and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunofluorescence for about 2 weeks. During EGB therapy the astrocytes regained their cellular processes, containing intense oxidative enzyme activities and GFAP-immunofluorescence as early as after 1 week of treatment. In the EM, astrocytes often appeared hypertrophic, surrounding myelin vacuoles and displaying phagocytosis of myelin debris. We conclude that EGB can accelerate the reabsorption of TET-induced cerebral edema and improve the astroglial reaction.", "PMC4028369": "Six to thirty percent of right ventricular-to-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) valved conduits in children fail within 5 years. Experience with correction of tetralogy of Fallot has shown that a competent pulmonary valve is not essential for excellent late results in most patients. Between March 1980 and November 1984, 26 patients who were 12.5 +/- 3.3 years old underwent conduit replacement 6.7 +/- 2.4 years after definitive repair of congenital heart defects in which a xenograft RV-PA valved conduit had been used. A new Dacron tube graft (n = 15) or pericardial (n = 8), dura mater (n = 2), or Dacron patch (n = 1) over the previous conduit bed was used as replacement. Preoperative mean right ventricular systolic pressure was 90.5 +/- 20 mm Hg and mean gradient across the conduit was 67.9 +/- 24.5 mm Hg. After replacement with a nonvalved conduit, right ventricular systolic pressure was reduced to 45.2 +/- 10.8 mm Hg (p less than .001), with a gradient of 8.9 +/- 7.6 mm Hg (p less than .001). There were no operative deaths. Follow-up at 19.5 +/- 14.9 months (range = 0 to 53) showed that all patients were in New York Heart Association class I (n = 21) or class II (n = 5). In the absence of pulmonary hypertension, hypoplastic pulmonary arteries, significant right ventricular dysfunction, or unrepaired tricuspid regurgitation, replacement of an obstructed conduit with a nonvalved conduit gives excellent early results and may diminish the need for late reoperation.", "PMC4131515": "The antibody-induced redistribution of beta2-microglobulin (beta2-micro) and HL-A antigens on the surface of living lymphocytes was studied by immunofluorescence. When all beta2-micro was redistributed on the lymphocyte membrane by specific rabbit antibodies and goat antirabbit Ig conjugates, the HL-A antigens were no more detectable with anti-HL-A conjugates outside the beta2-micro caps already formed. However, the redistribution of HL-A antigens fails to provoke the redistribution of all detectable beta2-micro molecules. These results suggest that HL-A antigens may be associated with beta2-micro at the cell surface, but that all beta2-micro molecules are not bound to HL-A antigens.", "PMC2850907": "The effect of estrogens on the renal responsiveness to parathyroid hormone (PTH) was examined by PTH loading tests with synthetic human-PTH (1-34) in 8 normal elderly females (mean +/- SD age, 81.0 +/- 7.1 yr) before and after administration of estrogen (Premarin 1.25 mg/day for 4 weeks). Basal urinary adenosine cyclic 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) excretion showed a tendency to increase after estrogen administration (5.47 +/- 1.68 vs 6.60 +/- 2.67 nmol/100 ml GFR) and the theoretical renal phosphorous threshold showed a tendency to decrease from 3.22 +/- 0.98 to 2.73 +/- 0.56 mg/dl. The blood ionized calcium concentration did not change after estrogen administration (4.44 +/- 0.16 vs 4.32 +/- 0.20 mg/dl) and serum phosphorous (P) decreased significantly (3.65 +/- 0.47 vs 3.01 +/- 0.42 mg/dl, p less than 0.05). There was no increase in mean serum immunoreactive PTH (0.34 +/- 0.10 vs 0.34 +/- 0.05 ngeq/ml). The urinary excretions of cAMP in response to PTH loading [100 U of human-PTH (1-34), intravenously] significantly (p less than 0.05) increased (94.8 +/- 57.0 vs 196.7 +/- 118.3 nmol/100 ml GFR/h) after estrogen administration. Moreover the changes in urinary excretion of cAMP (r = 0.698, p less than 0.01) and P (r = 0.555, p less than 0.05) induced by the PTH loading were positively correlated with serum estradiol in elderly females, assessed as groups before and after estrogen administration. These results suggest that estrogens may enhance the renal responsiveness to exogenous PTH administration.", "PMC2930322": "The ultrastructural features of the area postrema (AP) were investigated in the suckling lamb, weaned lamb and adult sheep. No morphological differences were observed between lambs and sheep. Unciliated ependymal cells, linked by zonulae adherentes-type junctions and gap junctions, cover the AP ventricular surface. Clusters of pyriform neurons, glial cells, and axons are present in the parenchyma. The blood vessels are surrounded by wide perivascular spaces, which present an inner and outer basal lamina. The capillaries are of the fenestrated type. Perivascular glial cells rest on the outer basal lamina of the perivascular space and form a continuous ensheathment with their cell bodies or with flattened interdigitating processes. Along adjacent perivascular glial processes gap junctions are present. From our ultrastructural observations it appears that the overall cellular morphology of AP of the sheep does not differ substantially from that of monogastric mammals.", "PMC3723492": "Rheumatoid factors (RF) constitute the major autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RF are directed against IgG Fc, are polyclonal, and are predominantly of the IgG and IgM classes. RF may participate in both synovial and extraarticular inflammation in RA, although the precise roles of serum IgG and IgM RF are unclear. The purpose of our study was to correlate serum IgG RF with serum IgM RF levels measured by radioimmunoassay and with clinical disease activity in 42 prospectively evaluated seropositive RA patients. IgM RF correlated with IgG RF levels and articular disease activity. IgG RF correlated with IgM RF but not with articular disease activity when adjusted for IgM RF.", "PMC3098259": "Lesions of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) produce obesity and hyperphagia. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. The connections of the PVN with brainstem centers for autonomic control suggest that a change in autonomic function could mediate the PVN obesity syndrome. We examined this hypothesis in a series of 3 experiments, searching specifically for changes in insulin secretion. Rats with PVN lesions were hyperphagic and hyperinsulinemic, when obese. However, hyperinsulinemia could not be detected prior to the onset of obesity or following weight reduction. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy reversed the PVN obesity and lowered insulin levels below those of sham-vagotomized rats. Since noradrenergic innervation of the hypothalamus is implicated in feeding, hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE) was depleted by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the central tegmental tract, posterior to the hypothalamus. The effects of NE depletion was compared with those of PVN lesions. Loss of hypothalamic NE resulted in hyperphagia with no increase in body weight and no change in insulin. Histological analyses indicated that the posterior PVN was the most effective lesion focus for producing disturbances in body weight and food intake. Although the results of these experiments implicate the autonomic nervous system in PVN obesity, basal hyperinsulinemia does not appear to be a primary feature of the syndrome.", "PMC3905165": "Serum drug concentration monitoring can be an invaluable aid to patient management, particularly in certain pathological conditions when individualisation of dosage is particularly critical. To be clinically useful, however, drug levels must be interpreted in the context of all factors that could influence the correlation between the concentration of the drug in plasma and the intensity of action. Several such factors may be operating in acute and chronic disease states. For example, a number of pathological conditions are associated with marked changes in the fraction of free, pharmacologically active drug in plasma and this will result in disruption of the normal relationship between total serum drug level and effect, as seen for phenytoin in uraemia. An altered response to a given serum drug level in disease states may also be caused by changes in tissue distribution, by abnormal accumulation of pharmacologically active metabolites in plasma or by changes in end-organ responsiveness. The latter are best illustrated by the altered sensitivity to digoxin in patients with various conditions, including hypokalaemia and thyroid disease. In addition to the factors listed above, consideration should also be given to potential interactions with concomitantly used drugs and to the possibility of analytical errors, especially in view of the evidence that the performance of otherwise reliable drug assays may be grossly impaired in certain diseases (e.g. uraemia), due to abnormal plasma composition and/or accumulation of interfering metabolites. In view of these complexities, a correct interpretation of serum drug levels requires a good knowledge of clinical pharmacology and a close collaboration between physician and laboratory. In any case, serum drug concentrations, like other laboratory tests, are not a substitute for careful patient observation, and any decision about drug treatment should be primarily based upon evaluation of the clinical state and, whenever possible, direct measurement of drug effects.", "PMC3154944": "A simple instance of parallel computation in neural networks occurs when the eye orients to a novel visual target. Consideration of target-elicited saccadic eye movements opens the question of how spatial position is represented in the visual pathways involved in this response.

An alternative approach based on distributed coding is developed.", "PMC2794157": "Two cases of retinoblastoma in fish are described.

Overall, 92% of the babies commenced breastfeeding and 54% were still breastfed by 3 months of age. This proportion dropped to 30% by 6 months, 20% by 9 months, and 16% by 12 months. The prevalence of breastfeeding soon after birth, and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age was studied according to socioeconomic status as measured by family income. Children from the poorest families were less likely to be breastfed from birth than those from the richest families (89% and 97%, respectively), and also showed lower prevalence of breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months. By the age of 12 months poor children showed the highest prevalence of breastfeeding.", "PMC4075082": "The effects of an acute injection of morphine on the activities of mesotelencephalic, tuberoinfundibular and incertohypothalamic dopamine (DA) neurons was estimated by measuring: the rate of turnover of DA (decline after alpha-methyltyrosine); and the concentration of the DA metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), in brain regions containing cell bodies or terminals of these neurons (i.e. nucleus accumbens, striatum, median eminence and various hypothalamic nuclei). The rate of turnover of DA and the concentration of DOPAC were increased in nucleus accumbens and striatum and decreased in the median eminence 60 min after the administration of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.). Morphine increased the rate of turnover of DA and the concentration of DOPAC in brain regions containing both cell bodies (periventricular nucleus and medial zona incerta) and terminals (medial preoptic, preopticosuprachiasmatic and dorsomedial nuclei) of incertohypothalamic DA neurons. The effects of morphine in all brain regions were blocked by pretreatment with naltrexone. These results indicate that incertohypothalamic DA neurons are stimulated by the acute administration of morphine, and in this respect they resemble the extrahypothalamic mesotelencephalic DA neurons rather than hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular DA neurons.", "PMC3927061": "Exogenous nutrient administration has been shown to significantly stimulate tumor growth in numerous animal models. The present study was performed to determine if substrate-induced alterations in tumor metabolism could be exploited to potentiate tumor response to cycle-specific chemotherapy. Following subcutaneous mammary tumor (AC-33) implantation, 55 female Lewis/Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of three nutritional regimens for 48 hr: (1) protein-depleted chow (0.03% protein) ad lib per os, (2) standard rat chow (22.0% protein) ad lib per os, or (3) total parenteral nutrition (TPN; 18.6% dextrose/2.8% amino acids). One-half of the animals in each group received a single dose of methotrexate (5 mg/kg im) while the remaining animals received placebo (saline) injections. At sacrifice, methotrexate-treated animals receiving TPN demonstrated a significantly smaller tumor volume (0.47 +/- 0.44 cm3) compared to animals given either protein depleted chow (1.30 +/- 0.76 cm3) or standard rat chow (1.34 +/- 0.83 cm3) (P less than 0.01). In this animal model, adjuvant TPN was found to significantly potentiate tumor response to cycle-specific chemotherapy with no detectable exacerbation of host toxicity.", "PMC3766450": "A correction needs to be made to the form of selenium used in earlier studies; what was believed to be selenite-Se in solution is now known to have been selenate-Se. In the present study, excretion of Se was followed in 13 women after ingestion of 1 mg Se as selenite or selenate in solution. Fecal excretion of selenate-Se was less than for selenite-Se reflecting a higher apparent absorption [94 +/- 4% (SD), 62 +/- 14%, respectively]. Peak excretion of Se occurred 3 h earlier for selenate-Se than for selenite-Se and was 6 times higher. Total urinary excretion of selenate-Se was 3 times that of selenite-Se and still 2 times as high when expressed as % absorbed dose. Total recovery of Se in urine and feces was similar for both forms. There was remarkable agreement between these results and those reported earlier for selenate-Se (Selovet-1) and selenite-Se.", "PMC3005826": "We demonstrate that [3H]captopril selectively labels angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.14.15.1) (ACE) and employ this technique to probe enzyme-inhibitor interactions. [3H]Captopril binding sites copurify with ACE activity from rat lung or rat brain. At each stage of the purification the Vmax/Bmax ratio, or kcat is 17,000 min-1 with hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine as substrate. The specificity of [3H]captopril binding is apparent in the similar pharmacologic profile of inhibition in crude and pure enzyme preparations. Furthermore, binding sites and enzyme activity comigrate in gel filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments. Equilibrium analysis of [3H]captopril binding to purified ACE reveals a Bmax of 6 nmol/mg of protein (KD = 2 nM), demonstrating the presence of one inhibitor binding site per polypeptide chain. The kinetics of [3H]captopril binding are characterized by monophasic association and dissociation rate constants of 0.026 nM-1 min-1 and 0.034 min-1, respectively. The affinity of ACE for both [3H] captopril and enalaprilat is greater at 37 degrees than at 0 degree, demonstrating that these interactions are entropically driven, perhaps by an isomerization of the enzyme molecule. The ionic requirements for [3H]captopril binding and substrate catalysis differ. Chloride and bromide ion, but not fluoride, are about 100-fold more potent stimulators of binding than catalysis. When the active site Zn2+ ion is replaced by Co2+, catalysis was stimulated 2-fold, whereas binding activity was decreased by 70%.", "PMC3244404": "In this study, changes in individual proteins in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMN) and the preoptic area (POA) of the female rat brain were quantitatively assessed following either a short treatment (2 h) or a discontinuous schedule of estradiol. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats were implanted with estradiol capsules or sham-implanted for the appropriate paradigm and sacrificed by decapitation. Punches of brain tissue containing the VMN and POA were incubated with 35S-methionine and 35S-cysteine, and the labeled proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Estradiol-induced changes were quantitatively assessed by computerized optical densitometry and subjected to a normalization procedure between pairs of estradiol-treated and OVX control gels. A number of proteins within the VMN and POA were found to be positively or negatively affected in labeling after either hormone administration paradigm. In both brain regions, the population of proteins affected in labeling after 2 h of estradiol treatment were markedly different from those affected after the discontinuous hormone paradigm. Comparison of the VMN and POA also indicated that the populations of proteins affected in labeling by either hormone treatment paradigm were different, with there being only 3 proteins (from a total of 39) affected in the same direction and 2 affected in the opposite direction by the hormone in both regions.

Incubation of the tissue with 0.2 muM aldosterone markedly increases this response to the two agents; incubation for a similar time without steroid reduces the response. The permeability responses (sodium transport and water flow) of the intact tissue to vasopressin, theophylline, and exogenous cAMP are also considerably greater in bladders incubated with aldosterone than without. The results are interpreted as indicating that the foregoing permissive effects of aldosterone on the permeability responses to vasopressin and theophylline are mediated by a steroid-dependent increase in the accumulation of cAMP in the pertinent epithelial cells, probably as a consequence of a diminution in the rate of degradation of the intracellular nucleotide.", "PMC3952814": "In the regenerating liver hepatocytes the centriolar cycle is retarded corresponding to the delay of the nuclear cycle up to the beginning of G2-block. A prolonged staying of cells in the premitotic condition results in the phenomenon that according to their DNA these cells correspond to the G2-period, whereas according to their centriolar complex structure they move into the following G1 and G0-periods, passing mitosis. Thus, in the G2-blocked hepatocytes there is a separation of the nuclear cycle and centriolar cycles.

The purpose was to gain insight into the release process responsible for this type of acetylcholine secretion. It was found that caffeine and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate increased significantly the frequency of slow mepps in Botx-poisoned muscles, but had no effect on slow mepps in control muscles. Vinblastine and cytochalasin B significantly increased the slow mepp frequency in Botx-poisoned as well as in normal control muscles. Inhibitors of oxidative metabolism reduced the frequency of slow mepps by 90%, indicating a high energy requirement for this type of release. No agent was found to augment the slow mepp frequency above 1-2 Hz, suggesting that an upper limit exists for this type of packaging and release of acetylcholine.", "PMC3968119": "We used a glass tube containing water at body temperature to simulate a lower limb and applied commonly used synthetic-cast materials to this artificial limb in order to measure the exotherm created by these materials.

The objectives of this study are: (1) to determine the association between largest tumor diameter assessed by clinical transillumination and largest tumor diameter assessed by measurement of the histologic slide; (2) to predict a clinical transillumination diameter for each enucleation specimen based on the best combination of histologic variables--diameter, height, location, and tumor shape; and (3) to use the predicted transillumination diameter in place of histologic diameter measurement as a prognostic factor for patients treated by enucleation in order to reevaluate previously reported survival outcomes for patients treated by proton beam and enucleation. Comparison of measurements on 40 eyes indicated that transillumination largest diameter measurements were larger than histologic slide measurements (mean difference, 2.87 mm). Multiple linear regression analysis yielded the following equation: transillumination diameter = [4.73 + (0.58 X histologic diameter) + (0.38 X histologic height) + (1.87 X anterior location)].

The H-D and respective H-I cultures have GC contents which are identical within the limits of experimental error. Most cultures of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, including the holotype culture, have 50.4 +/- 0.9 moles% GC in their DNA; two bdellovibrio isolates of presently uncertain nomenclatural status contain DNA of about 43% GC. Optical melting profiles of all the DNA from all of these organisms are particularly steep, indicating little compositional heterogeneity.

Adherent and sIgM+ cell-depleted bone marrow (BM) from untreated or 5-fluorouracil-pretreated donors or day 12 fetal liver cells were used as precursor cell populations. When adherent cells from thymus or highly enriched BM-derived macrophages were co-cultured with precursor cells, mature B cells were not developed. Similarly, aBM cell layers generated in the presence of hydrocortisone and horse serum were unable to support aBM cell-dependent precursor differentiation, even though cortisone was removed before the addition of precursor cells. In contrast, this type of microenvironment promoted the differentiation of precursor of myeloid cell lineages. Repeated treatment of established aBM cell populations with a monoclonal anti-macrophage antibody (31.3, known to recognize a surface marker on a subset of BM macrophages) and complement abolished the capacity of otherwise functional aBM cells to sustain the development of B cell precursors. Macrophage-depleted aBM cells regained their function after supplementation with highly enriched BM-derived macrophages grown in vitro. Limiting dilution analysis of aBM cells in microcultures containing saturating numbers of early B cell progenitors also suggests the participation of more than one cell type in the BM cell population. In conclusion, differentiation of early B cell progenitors requires macrophages in addition to at least one additional cell type contained in the aBM cell population.", "PMC3397965": "To assess the short and longterm efficacy of intensive inpatient treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 16 patients, the test group, admitted to a hospital based rheumatic disease unit (mean length of stay 12.4 days) were studied, using clinical and laboratory variables. The comparison group was similarly evaluated, using 10 outpatients with active RA to whom hospitalization was recommended, but refused by the patients. Both groups were studied intensively over a 12-week period. In addition, a 2-year followup was performed on 12 test group inpatients and 8 comparison group outpatients, using the same variables plus a functional status questionnaire. Health care costs were determined for both groups and corrected for a 1985 dollar value. The test group showed significant improvement in morning stiffness, pain, and joint score, whereas the comparison group improved only in pain score during the initial 12-week period. At 2 years, the test group and the comparison group showed significant improvement in morning stiffness, pain, grip strength, and joint score. The comparison group initially had a somewhat lower index of disease activity. The test group maintained their initial improvement and none required rehospitalization. Functional status scores were similar for both groups. Health care costs were initially higher for the test group ($5,065); followup care cost for the test group was $99 less/year than the comparison group over 2 years.

CsA was dissolved in ethanol. 500 and 2000 ng/ml increased resistance of renal vessels by 0.97 +/- 0.55 x 10(5) and 2.29 +/- 1.33 x 10(5) dyn s cm-5, respectively (mean values +/- SD, n = 12). The vasoconstriction developed gradually over 4 min. The vasopressor effect of CsA was not changed by saralasin (10(-6) M), nifedipine (10(-6) M) and ketanserin (10(-6) M), but was completely blocked by phentolamine and prazosin (each 10(-6) M). CsA-induced vasoconstriction was not prevented by perfusion with Ca(2+)-free solution containing 2 mmol EGTA. Similarly, pretreatment with reserpine to deplete sympathetic nerve endings from catecholamines did not affect CsA-induced vasoconstriction. The findings suggest that CsA-induced vasoconstriction is mediated by stimulation of alpha 1-receptors. Ca2+ influx does not play a role for CsA-induced vasoconstriction. Prolonged perfusion of rat kidneys with the vehicle cremophor EL elicits an irreversible increase in perfusion pressure.", "PMC3546561": "Recent treatment strategies have been directed toward blockade of estrogen action or inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis as a means of inducing regression of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The major source of estrogen in postmenopausal women is the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrone through the enzyme aromatase. It is known that aromatase activity increases proportionately with degree of obesity in women. To test the importance of this modulatory factor, we correlated body weight with estrogen excretion in our population of patients with breast cancer and found significant relationships. In situ production of estradiol from plasma precursors within breast cancer tissue may provide another source of estrogen. Major enzymes mediating estrogen biosynthesis were found to be present in tumor biopsy specimens. Aromatase activity was found to be present in 48/61 human tumors, sulfatase in 35/35, and 17 beta -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in 41/41. One inhibitor of aromatase, aminoglutethimide, has been extensively studied in patients with breast cancer. The additional effects of this drug on cholesterol side-chain cleavage and on 11-hydroxylase activity require coadministration of replacement glucocorticoid in treatment regimens. In pilot trials, 37% of patients experienced objective tumor regression with a combination of 1000 mg aminoglutethimide and 40 mg hydrocortisone daily. In randomized clinical trials with this regimen, aromatase inhibition with aminoglutethimide produced tumor regression with similar frequency as did surgical hypophysectomy, surgical adrenalectomy, or tamoxifen administration. The side effects of aminoglutethimide, including lethargy, skin rash, and ataxia complicate its use even though these problems are generally transient. Regimens of low-dose aminoglutethimide are being developed to reduce these side effects. Low-dose aminoglutethimide appears to block aromatase effectively and to have limited side effects, and is undergoing extensive clinical trial. A more specific aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione, is now also being tested clinically, whereas MDL 18962, another new selective inhibitor, is undergoing study in animals.", "PMC2648740": "Prior studies of gas transport mechanisms are reviewed with the aim of using these results to suggest improvements over current methods of ventilation. These concepts are cast in a simpler framework that more clearly identifies those factors that limit the rate of gas transport under conditions typical of HFV. One simplification introduced simulates the enhancement of molecular diffusion due to the movement of gas back-and-forth through regions of varying cross-sectional area. The region of the lung that currently poses the greatest resistance to gas transport is represented by those airways having diameters in the range of 1.0 to 2.5 mm. This suggests that new efforts should be devoted to better understanding the nature of transport in this zone and to the development of variations in the method of ventilation that have the greatest influence there.", "PMC3581523": "The material presented in this article represents the opinions and experiences of the authors and is intended to serve as guidance for obtaining more predictable results with chemexfoliation.

The fate of any alpha-glucoside entering the small intestine was studied by comparing the net disappearance of such alpha-glucoside from the small intestine with the absorption of glucose into the mesenteric venous blood. Glucose absorption from the small intestine was measured in sheep equipped with catheters in the mesenteric vein and carotid artery. A continuous infusion of [6-3H]glucose was used to determine glucose utilization by the mesenteric-drained viscera and the whole-body glucose turnover rate (GTR). The amounts of alpha-glucoside entering the small intestine when the dried-grass and maize-based diets were given were 13.9 (SE 1.5) and 95.4 (SE 16.2) g/24 h respectively; apparent digestibilities of such alpha-glucoside in the small intestine were 60 and 90% respectively. The net absorption of glucose into the mesenteric venous blood was -2.03 (SE 1.20) and 19.28 (SE 0.75) mmol/h for the dried-grass and maize-based diets respectively. Similarly, total glucose absorption amounted to 1.52 (SE 1.35) and 23.33 (SE 1.86) mmol/h (equivalent to 7 and 101 g/24 h respectively). These values represented 83 and 111% of the alpha-glucoside apparently disappearing from the small intestine, determined using the re-entrant cannulated sheep.

The advantages of using a carbon dioxide laser are its lack of pigment dependence, its ability to act both as a photocoagulator and as a phototransector, and its ability to deposit its energy in a well-defined area without adverse effect on neighboring ocular tissue. The main disadvantage of the carbon dioxide laser in vitreoretinal surgery is that in a fluid medium, such as the vitreous, the laser tip must be placed in direct physical contact with the target tissue to obtain a reaction.", "PMC3203174": "Communicative hydrocephalus (CH) is considered as one of the late sequelae of severe craniocerebral injury. However, as most of the series of patients with CH described in the literature deal with the results of various shunting procedures, the incidence of post-traumatic communicative hydrocephalus is not documented. We have found that almost 3.9% of 335 severe craniocerebral-injured patients develop communicative hydrocephalus. These patients were unconscious for various periods of time, therefore the triad described by Hakim and Adams cannot by itself lead the clinician to suspect possible development of communicative hydrocephalus. It is suggested that in prolonged coma, or in the presence of arrest in clinical progress in conscious craniocerebral-injured patients, communicative hydrocephalus should be suspected.", "PMC2615214": "Analysis of the early and long-term results of surgical treatment of 218 patients with a defect of the interventricular septum and aortic valve incompetence permits to recommend the wide use of radical plastic correction of a defect without aortic valve substitution.", "PMC3663763": "Mouse low-differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma (LD RMS) A7 contains 4.5 mg/cm3 of skeletal muscle type myosin and 9.7 mg/cm3 of actin.

In skeletal muscles the tissue concentrations of myosin and actin is close to the cytoplasmic concentrations. In mouse femoral muscles the tissue and cytoplasmic concentrations of myosin (approximately 102 mg/cm3) and actin (approximately 67 mg/cm3) are 8 (for myosin) and 2.5 times (for actin) higher than the cytoplasmic concentrations of these proteins in tumour cells. The molar ratio of myosin to actin concentrations is 1:26 in the tumour and 1:8 in the muscles.

The patient had a fistula that was associated with spontaneous disappearance of a large staghorn calculus in the involved kidney. The disappearance of the calculus and the presence of a pyeloduodenal fistula were confirmed at surgical exploration. Although neither an excretory urogram nor a retrograde pyelogram was useful to diagnose the fistula preoperatively a 111indium oxine-leukocyte scan revealed the renal abscess and pyeloduodenal fistula.", "PMC3025553": "By comparative S1 analysis we investigated the in vivo regulation of transcription of the chromosomal dnaA gene coding for a protein essential for the initiation of replication at the chromosomal origin. Inactivation of the protein in dnaA mutants results in derepression, whereas excess DnaA protein (presence of a DnaA overproducing plasmid) leads to repression of dnaA transcription. Both dnaA promoters are subject to autoregulation allowing modulation of transcriptional efficiency by at least 20-fold. Increasing the number of oriC sequences (number of DnaA binding sites) in the cell by introducing oriC plasmids leads to a derepression of transcription. Autoregulation and binding to oriC suggest that the DnaA protein exerts a major role in the regulation of the frequency of initiation at oriC. The efficiency of transcription of the dnaA2 promoter is reduced in the absence of dam methylation, which is involved in the regulation of oriC replication.", "PMC4039465": "The natural history of estrogen-responsive breast cancers often involves a phenotypic change to an estrogen-unresponsive, more aggressive tumor. The human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, which requires estradiol for tumor formation in vivo and shows growth stimulation in response to estradiol in vitro, is a model for hormone-responsive tumors. The v-rasH onc gene was transfected into MCF-7 cells. The cloned MCF-7ras transfectants, which expressed the v-rasH messenger RNA and v-rasH p21 protein (21,000 daltons), were characterized. In contrast to the parental cell line, MCF-7ras cells no longer responded to exogenous estrogen in culture and their growth was minimally inhibited by exogenous antiestrogens. When tested in the nude mouse, the MCF-7ras cells were fully tumorigenic in the absence of estrogen supplementation. Thus, cells acquiring an activated onc gene can bypass the hormonal regulatory signals that trigger the neoplastic growth of a human breast cancer cell line.", "PMC4200842": "The NH(2)-terminal amino acid distribution of Streptococcus faecalis R soluble and ribosomal proteins isolated from cells at different stages of growth on either folate-sufficient or folate-deficient medium was determined by the dinitrophenyl method. The NH(2)-terminal residues do not follow the random distribution observed for the total amino acid composition of S. faecalis soluble and ribosomal proteins. Methionine and alanine occur most frequently; serine, threonine, aspartic and glutamic acids, and glycine are also present at the NH(2)-terminal position of S. faecalis R proteins. The absence of folic acid yields cells that are incapable of formylating methionyl-transfer ribonucelic acid tRNA(f) (Met), but does not affect either the qualitative or quantitative NH(2)-terminal distribution of total soluble or total ribosomal proteins compared to cells grown with folate. A small quantitative difference was observed in the frequency of distribution of certain amino acids at the NH(2)-termini between log and stationary phase soluble proteins. The amino acid residues found at the NH(2)-terminal position of S. faecalis proteins are qualitatively similar to those reported for several other organisms.", "PMC4021832": "The angioarchitecture of rat brain with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-saline and renal forms of experimental hypertension were studied and compared with those of normotensive rats. The number of pial arteries of the third, fourth, and fifth order of branching was lower and their diameter smaller in hypertensive animals as compared with controls. In the medulla oblongata, pons, and mesencephalon the number of arterioles was lower and the total length of capillaries per unit volume was shorter in the experimental group. Rarefication of the capillary network was observed also in rats with spontaneous hypertension. Rarefication was found to begin at the earliest stage of developing hypertension. It was observed as soon as 24 hr after the ligation of the remaining kidney in rats with unilateral nephrectomy. A substantial decrease was recorded in the number of pial arteries with preserved lumens. The hypothesis that the rarefaction of the vascular net in the brain may lead to the formation of zones of ischemia is presented here.", "PMC4477481": "The cardiovascular effects of ergometrine have been examined using animal models in vivo and in vitro. In rats in vivo the pressor effects of a standard dose of ergometrine were found to be dependent upon the anaesthetic used for the procedure. The pressor action of ergometrine was greater when urethane, an anaesthetic which produces both sympathetic and parasympathetic acitivity, was used. The in-vitro experiments, using isolated rabbit aorta and portal vein, failed to explain the phenomenon; they suggested that ergometrine has a direct action on the alpha-adrenoceptor in rabbits. No evidence was found to suggest that ergometrine inhibits noradrenaline uptake or its release from the nerve terminals.", "PMC3905861": "As a consequence of osteomyelitis in a newborn, a defect developed on the medial part of the distal bony epiphysis and metaphysis of the right femur, resulting in a 30 degree varus deformity.

In vaginally delivered newborns the lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density was 38%, in the caesarean section group with general anaesthesia 27%, and with epidural anaesthesia 22% lower than in the corresponding mother group. Vaginally delivered newborns have lower lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density than those delivered by caesarean section. A plausible explanation is the down-regulation of the beta 2-adrenoceptors during labour and delivery.", "PMC2847169": "Membrane proteins of transporting epithelia are often distributed between apical and basolateral surfaces to produce a functionally polarized cell. The distribution of Na+,K+-ATPase [ATP phosphohydrolase (Na+/K+-transporting), EC 3.6.1.37] between apical and basolateral membranes of hepatocytes has been controversial. Because Na+,K+-ATPase activity is fluidity dependent and the physiochemical properties of the apical membrane reduces its fluidity, we investigated whether altering membrane fluidity might uncover cryptic Na+,K+-ATPase in bile canalicular (apical) surface fractions free of detectable Na+,K+-ATPase and glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. Apical fractions exhibited higher diphenylhexatriene-fluorescence polarization values when compared with sinusoidal (basolateral) membrane fractions. When 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl 8-(cis-2-n-octylcyclopropyl)octanoate (A2C) was added to each fraction, Na+,K+-ATPase, but not glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, was activated in the apical fraction. In contrast, further activation of both enzymes was not seen in sinusoidal fractions. The A2C-induced increase in apical Na+,K+-ATPase approached 75% of the sinusoidal level. Parallel increases in apical Na+,K+-ATPase were produced by benzyl alcohol and Triton WR-1339. All three fluidizing agents decreased the order component of membrane fluidity. Na+,K+-ATPase activity in each subfraction was identically inhibited by the monoclonal antibody 9-A5, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. These findings suggest that hepatic Na+,K+-ATPase is distributed in both surface membranes but functions more efficiently and, perhaps, specifically in the sinusoidal membranes because of their higher bulk lipid fluidity.", "PMC3954865": "The male rat emits ultrasonic (22 kHz) vocalizations after ejaculation and behavioural and electrophysiological evidence suggests that this vocalization reflects an inhibitory state underlying and determining the postejaculatory refractory period (PEI).

Accordingly, the World Health Organization undertook a prospective study in which several noninvasive methods were employed together in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy. The examinations analyzed encompassed chest roentgenography, electrocardiography, vectorcardiography, mechanocardiography, echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy and ventriculography and pulmonary scintigraphy. From the chest X-ray, the size of the main pulmonary artery, the transpulmonary artery distance and the size of the right descending pulmonary artery were analyzed; correct identification of patients with or without pulmonary hypertension was achieved in only 40%. With respect to the electrocardiogram, the number of false negative and false positive findings renders this method of negligible usefulness. Mechanocardiography proved technically difficult and incurred inconsistencies in interpretation such that this method was only rarely useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. The same held true for the use of echocardiography since it is technically difficult to obtain adequate imaging in patients with overinflated lungs and the pulmonic valve can only be visualized in about 50% of the patients. Right ventricular systolic time intervals would be interest but their measurement can only be accomplished in a small number of patients. Myocardial scintigraphy with thallium-201 may render indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension if the right ventricular wall can be visualized; this is the case in 80% of patients in whom mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 30 mm Hg but only in 56% of those with mean pulmonary artery pressures between 21 and 30 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3513292": "Radiotherapy is an effective means to treat several benign diseases; in fact, the therapeutic effects set in quickly and are of a long-term nature.

The average SCE in the malnourished animals was significantly higher than in the control group (p less than 0.01). The distribution of SCE per mitosis was also significantly higher in the malnourished animals (p less than 0.001).

It was shown that the emptying of solids from the stomach was significantly slower than that of liquid, whether liquid alone or liquid in the presence of solid material. It was concluded from these results that, in the case of a solid test meal from which radio-label could be eluted, the free label would empty considerably faster than the remaining solid material.

With the exception of one isolate from cattle, all had restriction endonuclease fragment patterns identical to the fragment patterns for the reference strain, M. paratuberculosis ATCC 19698T. These results confirm other reports and indicate that organisms identified as typical M. paratuberculosis isolates are genetically very similar.

In the asthmatic, awareness of the bronchial inflammation at the time of diagnosis is essential, as it contributes to prognosis and therapeutic orientation. The diagnosis of bronchial inflammation begins with the clinical assessment, such as cough, expectoration and the worsening of symptoms in the morning alerts the clinician. In the course of certain clinical forms of asthma the absence of any relief of airflow obstruction by bronchodilators, although it is proved to be reversible after a few days of glucocorticoids, is evidence of inflammation. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy extends the clinical examination and enables a direct observation of airways inflammation. In addition it allows sampling, such as bronchial biopsy and/or broncho-alveolar lavage. The mechanism of bronchial inflammation are well understood; some mastocytes (mucous) are present in the broncho-alveolar contents and are probably the origin of inflammatory reaction, whether the stimulus be allergenic or not. The mediators liberated lead in part to the bronchial obstruction but equally to cellular recruitment and thus to an amplification of the initial reaction. Probably the eosinophils play a fundamental role ar this stage. The alveolar macrophages are equally implicated in this inflammatory reaction. Bronchial inflammation appears as a result of complex cellular reactions, regulated by chemical mediators. The most obvious consequence of bronchial inflammation is the delayed bronchial reaction. The experimental model contributes to physio-pathological understanding and a characterisation of the inflammatory components is observed principally in those patients with severe asthma. Agents capable of causing or aggravating bronchial hyper-reactivity can also induce bronchial inflammation. From this observation the idea is born of a relation between the concept of bronchial hyper-reactivity and bronchial inflammation. Acquired bronchial hyper-reactivity evolves in parallel to the symptoms and its intensity is correlated with the severity of the asthma. An understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms without doubt will bring new therapeutic perspectives.", "PMC3338453": "Limited action of papain on the native forms of two cellobiohydrolases (CBH) from Trichoderma reesei (CBH I, 65 kDa, and CBH II, 58 kDa) leads to the isolation of the respective core fragments (56 kDa and 45 kDa) which are fully active on small, soluble substrates, but have a strongly reduced activity (respectively 10% and 50% of the initial value) on microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel). By partial sequencing at the C terminus of the CBH I core and at the N terminus of the CBH II core the papain cleavage sites have been assigned in the primary structures (at about residue 431 and 82 respectively). This limited action of papain on the native enzymes indicates the presence of hinge regions linking the core to these terminal glycopeptides. The latter conserved sequences appear either at the C or N terminus of several cellulolytic enzymes from Trichoderma reesei [Teeri et al. (1987) Gene 51, 43-52]. The specific activities of the intact enzymes and their cores on two forms of insoluble cellulose (crystalline, amorphous) differentiate the CBH I and CBH II in terms of adsorption and catalytic properties. Distinct functions can be attributed to the terminal peptides: for intact CBH II the N-terminal region contributes in the binding onto both cellulose types; the homologous C-terminal peptide in CBH I, however, only affects the interaction with microcrystalline cellulose. It could be inferred that CBH I and its core bind preferentially to crystalline regions. This seems to be corroborated by the results of CBH I/CBH II synergism experiments.", "PMC4352867": "1. Human lung tissue, passively sensitized with reaginic antibodies, released prostaglandins E(1), E(2) and F(2alpha) in addition to histamine and slow reacting substance (SRS-A), when exposed to the appropriate antigen.

Experiments with rats and guinea-pigs showed that the release of RCS is not confined to anaphylactic reactions mediated by non-reaginic antibodies but may be a feature of anaphylaxis in guinea-pigs alone.3. Human lung tissue gently agitated with a blunt nylon rod liberated an E-type prostaglandin and RCS in addition to histamine and SRS-A.4. Human isolated bronchial muscle was contracted by RCS.5. Disodium cromoglycate antagonized the release of prostaglandins during anaphylaxis but not during agitation of human lung tissue, whereas indomethacin blocked the release of prostaglandins during agitation and anaphylaxis.6.

The pure-tone selection criterion was an average hearing loss of less than 60 dB at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, with no thresholds exceeding 70 dB and only one threshold exceeding 60 dB. Both tests proved independently to be most effective in the diagnosis of cerebello-pontine angle (CPA) tumours and to a lesser extent for brainstem lesions. The ABR was positive in 100% of CPA group and 90% in the brainstem group compared with 93% and 70% respectively for the ART. The combination of the two tests provides patterns of abnormality which are more disease specific. In the CPA cases the most common and consistent patterns of abnormality were the unilateral delay of Wave V or III and V of the ABR associated with a vertical ART pattern indicative of an abnormality of the ipsi and contralateral reflexes on stimulating the affected side. Intrinsic brainstem lesions most commonly resulted in bilateral ABR abnormalities combined with the full-house ART pattern indicative of bilateral abnormalities of both ipsi and contralateral reflexes.", "PMC3988133": "Using the technique described, Hickman catheters can be inserted by a single operator at low cost and risk.

Unilateral implantation of dexamethasone around the PVN resulted in a decrease of hybridizable CRF mRNA at the dexamethasone-implanted side. Dexamethasone implants into the cerebral cortex, dorsal hippocampus, ventral subiculum, lateral septum or amygdala were without any effect on the CRF expression in the PVN. Corticosterone did not result in any significant change in CRF mRNA, when implanted into the paraventricular region, dorsal hippocampus or ventral subiculum.

We found that each of the three cell lines expressed vimentin; low-, middle-, and high-molecular-weight neurofilament proteins; and the synaptic vesicle membrane glycoprotein synaptophysin. Each of the cell lines also reacted with antibodies against neural cell adhesion molecules, but none of them were positive for antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein, keratin, microtubule-associated protein tau and microtubule-associated protein 2, human lymphocyte antigen-DR, epidermal growth factor receptor, and T-cell antigen. Immunoreactivities with anti-tenascin and anti-glioma-associated antibodies were variable in these cell lines. Anti-human lymphocyte antigen-A,B and anti-beta 2-microglobulin antibodies reacted with xenografts of D384 Med and D425 Med and were weakly positive for a small population of D384 Med cultured cells. In summary, the detection of neurofilament proteins and synaptophysin and the absence of glial fibrillary acidic protein provide strong evidence for a neuronal phenotype of D384 Med, D425 Med, and D458 Med.", "PMC4395452": "1. The synthesis of nucleic acids and the content of purine nucleotides have been studied in selected purine-requiring strains of Escherichia coli including a purB(-) strain and a purB(-)guaA(-) strain. 2. When the exogenous purines can be converted into GTP but not into ATP, RNA is synthesized at the expense of intracellular ATP, ADP and AMP. 3. Net synthesis of RNA as measured by the incorporation of uracil can be correlated with the availability of GTP except when ATP falls to a very low concentration. 4. Nicotinamide nucleotides are not an important reservoir of adenine nucleotides for RNA synthesis.", "PMC3307744": "The immunohistochemical detection of different isoforms of actin provides useful data in the histopathological diagnosis of human tumours. The marked resistance of this protein to fixation and embedding procedures makes it a practical alternative to the ultrastructural search of microfilaments in routine tissue sections. Staining with monoclonal antibodies against alpha smooth muscle actin is helpful in the diagnosis of benign and malignant smooth muscle tumours and allows the differentiation of various types of spindle cell sarcomas. These antibodies are also useful in tracing the myoepithelial cells in normal and various pathological conditions of the breast and salivary glands. Skeletal muscle actin is a reliable marker in the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcomas. Its use should be combined and complemented with other markers (i.e. desmin; foetal, slow and fast myosins; myoglobin) to monitor the degree of rhabdomyoblastic differentiation of the neoplastic cells in single cases, a parameter of potential prognostic value.", "PMC3675486": "Prolonged exposure to an inappropriate vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) will usually lead to motion sickness, and it has been predicted on theoretical grounds that VOR gain may be decreased in weightlessness. While experiments during parabolic flight in aircraft tend to confirm this prediction, experiments during orbital spaceflight have led to apparently contradictory results. It is suggested that VOR gain is reduced initially, but that rapid compensatory mechanisms restore it to normal within minutes of reaching weightlessness. However, even though this process may lead to the rapid return of functionally normal gaze stability, it may not protect against the development of motion sickness.", "PMC3257227": "B cell surface immunoglobulin (SIg) plays an important role in antigen recognition and cellular activation. Cross-linking of SIg by bivalent antibody converts it into a detergent insoluble state. The resultant SIg may be partially solubilized by incubating the detergent insoluble cytoskeleton in buffers that convert F actin to G actin. Immunoprecipitation of SIg from the detergent soluble fraction of [35S]methionine-labeled B cells results in the co-isolation of 112 kDa, 42 kDa, (actin), and three additional proteins in the 70- to 73-kDa molecular mass range, isoelectric point 4.8 to 5.6. Analysis of anti-Ig immunoprecipitates made after preclearing with anti-alpha-actinin showed complete depletion of the 112-kDa protein, suggesting that the 112-kDa protein is immunologically related to alpha-actinin. These immunoprecipitates also showed partial depletion of 70- to 73-kDa proteins and mu and delta heavy chains. After treatment of a rat B cells with anti-Ig, much of the Ig-associated 112-kDa protein and 70- to 73-kDa proteins became detergent insoluble, concomitant with most of the SIg. The migration of the SIg-associated 112-kDa and 70- to 73-kDa proteins from the detergent soluble fraction to the detergent insoluble fraction after ligand treatment, suggests that these proteins might be involved in linking SIg to the underlying cytoskeleton and could be involved in the transmission of mitogenic signals.", "PMC2737499": "Sympathetic reactivity in patients suffering from menstrual migraine has been evaluated by means of blood pressure, heart rate and catecholamine monitoring during the tilt-table test performed either in the follicular or in the luteal phase of menstrual cycle. A sympathoadrenal activation mainly described by increased plasma epinephrine levels, has been documented in menstrual migraine not only during the luteal period but also in the early phases of migraine attacks. On the other hand, the interval phases seem to be characterized by a sympathetic chronic hypofunction. Variations in catecholaminergic reactivity are discussed as factors conditioning headache pathophysiology and attack epiphenomena.", "PMC3288039": "Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is essential for biogenic amine synthesis, and alterations in its metabolism occur at birth (atypical PKU), in neuropsychiatric illnesses, and in aging. BH4 therapy has been attempted in atypical PKU and in neuropsychiatric illness with some success and may become more viable as more is learned about BH4 metabolism and ways are discovered to elevate brain BH4 levels. It is intriguing to consider that a genetic defect in BH4 biosynthesis occurring at birth might go unrecognized and contribute to altered biogenic amine metabolism that occurs in neuropsychiatric illness. Since there seems to be a sensitivity of BH4 metabolism to genetic alterations, it is possible that altered BH4 metabolism is involved in some of deleterious effects associated with the aging process. A link between genetic alterations in BH4 metabolism at birth and adult neuropsychiatric illness and aging remains to be established, although this seems plausible. The presence of BH4 and other pterins in cells of the immune system as well as the pineal gland and other neuroendocrine tissues suggests the potential for other functions of pterins. Hopefully, future research will uncover the full potential for the therapeutic use of BH4 in a variety of diseases as well as elucidating other potential roles for pterin molecules which are present in many different systems.", "PMC3431672": "Focal cerebral blood flow changes for judgment of line orientation were determined using the 133Xe inhalation technique with 18 normal right-handed male subjects. Measurements were made during three conditions in the same session: a line orientation task, a sensorimotor control task, and normal rest. Blood flow changes attributable to the judgment of line orientation were found for the measure f1 at a detector centered over the right temporo-occipital region. For the measure IS this activation was significant in the temporo-occipital region in both hemispheres but significantly greater in the right hemisphere. For f1 the change in blood flow and for IS the percent change in blood flow in the right temporo-occipital region attributable to judgment of line orientation decreased as performance on the line orientation task improved.", "PMC3674003": "Red blood cell (RBC) antioxidant defense was investigated in eight individuals with hemoglobin E (Six EE and two E-B(+) thalassemia) and compared to that in six individuals with thalassemia and ten normal subjects. Individuals with hemoglobin E had increased incubated Heinz body formation (68% +/- 18%; p less than 0.001) compared to normal and thalassemic RBC (10% +/- 2% and 11% +/- 5%, respectively). Stimulated pentose phosphate shunt activity was increased in the thalassemic and decreased in the hemoglobin E RBC as compared to normal. The 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) content of the EE RBC was increased to 5.59 +/- 0.69 mumol/ml RBC as compared to normal (4.51 +/- 0.77; p less than 0.001). In the EE RBC, there was a direct correlation between Heinz body formation and DPG content (r = 0.73). Ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid (0.1 and 1.0 mM) were able to decrease the degree of Heinz body formation in the hemoglobin E RBC. Ascorbic acid (0.1 mM) prolonged the response of the pentose shunt. Thus impaired antioxidant defense may account for the persistence of the hemoglobin E gene in areas where malaria is endemic.

Animals were actively sensitized and 2 wk later were challenged through the airways. Airway responses of sensitized animals were compared to those of 6 control animals challenged with sufficient methacholine (MCh) to at least double RL and to 4 unsensitized control rats challenged with OA. Ten of 15 rats in the experimental group displayed an early response (ER), defined as an increase in RL of at least 50% within 1 h of challenge. A late response (LR) was considered to have occurred when the value of RL exceeded the mean plus 2 standard deviations of all the measurements taken from 1 h after challenge to the end of the experiment. Two rats died less than 240 min after OA challenge with RL greater than 200% baseline. The remaining 13 were studied for a total duration that ranged from 390 to 720 min and of these animals 10 demonstrated LRs. Maximal RL during the LR after OA was 287 +/- 49% (SE) baseline (range, 129 to 760) versus 115 +/- 15% (75 to 176) for control animals after MCh (p less than 0.01) and 52 +/- 3% (51 to 142; p less than 0.01) for unsensitized control animals after OA. There was no correlation between the magnitude of ER and LR; 3 LRs occurred in the absence of detectable ERs.

The villus height and the number of epithelial cells of the same villus were measured on the histological sections under a light microscope. Both the number of epithelial cells per villus and the villus surface area correlated well with the villus height and with the number of epithelial cells per villus sections. In the normal rat jejunum, the approximate values of the number of epithelial cells per villus surface and villus surface area may be estimated from the villus height or the number of epithelial cells per villus section.", "PMC4065209": "Within the feline locus coeruleus complex (LCx) there exists a subpopulation of neurons with a distinct behavioral neurophysiological profile; these neurons fire most during waking, less so during slow wave sleep, and fall virtually silent during paradoxical sleep (PS). These \"PS-off' cells have been thought to be noradrenergic, largely because their heterogeneous distribution throughout the LCx parallels the distribution of noradrenergic neurons within the feline dorsolateral pontine tegmentum. The alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine has been shown to markedly inhibit the central noradrenergic neurons of the anesthetized rat, regardless of the route of administration. We therefore tested the PS-off cells of the feline LCx with intravenous clonidine, to determine if they too were inhibited by this agent. We found 13/13 LCx PS-off cells to be inhibited by intravenous clonidine (2-4 micrograms/kg) as compared with saline controls; non-PS-off cells were not inhibited. These data add strength to the argument that the PS-off cells of the feline LCx are noradrenergic.", "PMC3431832": "Twenty-eight cases of posterior choroidal melanoma were treated with iodine-125 in gold eye plaques. Eleven cases were located within 3.0 mm of the optic nerve (group A), nine were within 3.0 mm of the fovea (group B), and eight were within 3.0 mm of the optic nerve and fovea (group C). The mean follow-up of group A was 46.3 months; group B, 25.5 months; and group C, 42.7 months. Complications included macular edema, cataract and tumor growth. Visual acuity remained within two lines of that tested preoperatively for 4 of 11 patients in group A, 4 of 9 in group B, and 5 of 8 in group C.

First, undecalcified ground sections of bone metastases were made from four patients with renal cell carcinoma. Second, renal cell carcinoma cell line (RCC-K1) was established from one of the four patients, and its effect on bone resorption in vitro was examined. Marked proliferation and activation of osteoclasts around the tumor cells was histologically demonstrated. Conditioned medium from the RCC-K1 cells contained potent bone-resorbing activity in vitro. The activity was reduced to basal level by calcitonin, but was not blocked by indomethacin. The activity was lost after dialysis (MW cutoff 3500), while it was retained after 2 weeks of storage. Levels of prostaglandin E2 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D of the RCC-K1-conditioned medium were insufficient to cause bone resorption in vitro. The conditioned medium did not stimulate cAMP accumulation in rat osteoblastic cells. These results suggest that renal cell carcinoma causes bone destruction through the stimulation of osteoclasts by locally secreting an unknown humoral factor or factors.", "PMC2896113": "Stools from 1000 travellers returning from the tropics were examined for intestinal parasites. The most frequently isolated intestinal pathogens were Giardia lamblia (5%) and E. histolytica (3.6%).

Among the chymotryptic peptides obtained from the reduced and S-carboxymethylated enzymes, only peptides C-3 were different from each other in terms of chromatographic behaviour on reverse-phase h.p.l.c. On the basis of chemical analyses of these peptides, it was shown that RNAase U2-B had an isopeptide bond in which Asp-32 was linked to Gly-33 through the beta-carboxy group in its side chain instead of the alpha-carboxy group. Deamidation of Asn-32 in RNAase U2-A led to the formation of this unusual linkage. The previously reported sequence of RNAase U2 [Sato & Uchida (1975) Biochem. J. 145, 353-360] was corrected by changing amino acid residues at eight different positions and by inserting an asparagine residue at position 32. The numbering of the positions of amino acid residues located downstream of Asn-32 was therefore shifted by 1.

The origin of the pain was, at the beginning of the century, attributed to an inflammation of fascia, tendons, ligaments, subcutaneous tissues and even the muscle itself. Although this inflammatory etiology is not based on proven anatomical facts, some authors advocate an organic pathology of unknown origin and the terms of fibrositis or primary fibromuscular pain are used in the literature, especially the anglo-saxon literature, to describe such symptomatology. Clinical diagnostic criteria have been recently proposed in order to differentiate primary fibromuscular pain from functional diffuse muscular pains. The authors discuss the legitimacy of such distinction.", "PMC3287591": "A new method used to study in vitro synthesis by human monocytes and alveolar macrophages of the essential complement components for the functional classical, alternative and terminal pathway is presented. The method is based on accumulation of major complements components on activators of the alternative (agarose beads) and classical (lgM-sensitized sheep erythrocytes; ElgM) pathway during co-culture with the phagocytes. There was a time-dependent increase in binding of labelled protein to the co-cultured activators, demonstrating de novo protein synthesis by the phagocytes. Moreover, there was a significant binding to the co-cultured agarose beads and ElgM of monoclonal anti-C3c, anti-C3g, polyclonal anti-C5-C9 and of two monoclonal antibodies (poly C9-MA and MCaEll) to a neoantigen of polymerized C9 present in the terminal complement complex (TCC). In addition, we found a significant binding of polyclonal anti-C4 antibodies to co-cultured ElgM. Incubation of the activators in human serum, subsequently revealed the same pattern of antibody binding. There was no binding of anti-S protein antibodies to the activators after incubation with serum or with the phagocytes. We thus conclude that mononuclear phagocyte-produced complement in the form of C3b, iC3b, and the TCC (C5b-9) was deposited on both activators, whereas C4b was detected on the ElgM. It is our hope that this method can be applied when studying complement biosynthesis by cells other than mononuclear phagocytes.", "PMC4937783": "Twenty-six strains and colony variants of Pseudomonas solanacearum belonging to four described biotypes were characterized, by using 169 phenotypic characters previously found useful in distinguishing among strains of other Pseudomonas species.

The authors attempted to define a subset of these adult patients who, based on clinical criteria, could reliably be excluded from cervical spine radiography, thus avoiding unnecessary radiation and saving considerable time and money in their evaluation. Patients fell into four groups: (1) patients who were awake, alert, and had no complaint of neck pain or tenderness on physical examination; (2) patients who were awake, alert, but had complaint of neck pain or tenderness on physical examination laterally over the trapezius muscle only; (3) patients who were awake, alert, but had complaint of central neck pain or tenderness on physical examination over the cervical spine or center of the neck; and (4) patients who were not fully awake or alert, were clinically intoxicated, had other painful or distracting injuries, or had focal neurologic findings. Patients in group 4 had significantly more fractures (21/387) when compared with all other patients (7/478). Patients with central neck pain or tenderness (group 3) had significantly more fractures (7/237) than patients without pain or tenderness or with these findings limited to the trapezius area (0/236).

After CS, a significantly increased incidence rate of RD was found compared to vaginal delivery (24.6% vs. 5.5%). The increased overall risk affected full term infants only but IRDS was more common after CS in preterm infants. Rupture of membranes or uterine contractions prior to CS significantly reduced the incidence rate of RD in full term infants. Acute maternal complications did not affect the incidence. The elevated RD rate could partly be related to an increased incidence of low Apgar score after CS, and to absence of labour and rupture of membranes before the CS. But full term infants with Apgar score of 7 or more, delivered surgically after rupture of membranes and start of contractions, still had almost three times higher incidence of RD.", "PMC3354956": "The spinal nerve root origins of the cutaneous nerves innervating the canine pelvic limb were determined in 12 barbiturate-anesthetized, healthy dogs by stimulating the dorsal roots L1-S3 and recording the evoked-action potentials from each cutaneous nerve. The dogs were then euthanatized, identification of each dorsal root and cutaneous nerve was verified by dissection, and the type of lumbosacral plexus (prefixed, median fixed, or postfixed) was determined. With one exception, the dorsal cutaneous branches and lateral cutaneous branches of L1-L3 originated only from their corresponding spinal nerve roots. The genitofemoral nerve received afferent fibers predominantly from L3-L4 nerve roots.

We have also examined the changes in the intracellular levels of free calcium in neonatal neutrophils and compared the results with those in adult neutrophils. Following exposure to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or zymosan-activated serum (ZyAS), neutrophils from adult donors showed an increase in intracellular free calcium, as determined by Quin 2/AM fluorescence, and in actin polymerization (45-55%), as measured by nitrobenzoxadiazole phallicidin fluorescence. These responses were abolished by preincubation with the calcium antagonist verapamil (0.1 mM), which inhibits both calcium influx and release from intracellular stores.

Brain death was induced by creating intracranial hypertension by inflating a balloon inserted into the subdural space. Hemodynamic parameters and left ventricular systolic function as assessed by echocardiography were measured before and during intracranial hypertension and 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 hrs after brain death. During intracranial hypertension, heart rate, systemic and pulmonary blood pressures, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance raised significantly. After brain death, all parameters decreased rapidly and significantly, and then stabilized. On comparison with values obtained before intracranial hypertension, systemic blood pressure decreased markedly following brain death, while no marked change was noted in cardiac output. This result is attributable to a marked reduction in peripheral vascular resistance following the induction of intracranial hypertension. The left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters did not change; consequently, fractional shortening did not change, either. The Weissler's index improved after brain death, reflecting a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance. This indicates limited usefulness of afterload-dependent cardiac indices. At the agonal period of brain death, three of 13 dogs died because of ventricular fibrillation or a marked decline in systemic blood pressure. Within five to eight hours after brain death, seven dogs died because of intractable acidosis. These results represent the specific hemodynamic features occurring after brain death. It is thought that recognition of these features is useful in managing cases of brain death and in selecting donors for heart transplants.", "PMC3907818": "A randomised double blind controlled trial was conducted to see whether vitamin A supplementation in the form of retinyl palmitate would increase the concentrations of serum retinol and retinol binding protein.

Supplementation continued for 6 months and blood samples were collected immediately before the start of supplementation, after 3 months and after 6 months. There was a small but statistically significant increase in serum retinol levels associated with supplementation, but no significant increase in serum retinol binding protein. The extent of the increase in serum retinol was related to the extent of the supplementation. On average, for every 10,000 IU of retinyl palmitate per day, the serum retinol concentration increased by 13 micrograms/l after 3 months (an increase of 2%) and 12 micrograms/l after 6 months of supplementation (2% increase).

Mechanical slaughtering methods often severed the spinal cord without cutting the carotid arteries. The manual method of slaughter cut one carotid artery plus one jugular vein. The effects of 9 different slaughtering methods on spontaneous and evoked electrical activity in the brain were examined in anaesthetised chickens and ducks. Severing the spinal cord without cutting the carotid arteries was found to result in death from asphyxia, and cutting one carotid artery plus one jugular vein was one of the slowest methods of killing the birds. Inducing a cardiac arrest at electrical stunning was the quickest method of inducing death. Spontaneous activity in the brain was lost before visual evoked activity. The times before loss of spontaneous activity varied between 23 and 233 s according to the method of slaughter and loss of evoked activity ranged between 90 and 349 s after slaughter.", "PMC3040480": "ACTH (1 unit per 1 rat) induced a 6-fold increase of the corticosterone synthesis in adrenals and a 2-fold increase of its secretion into the blood. Met-enkephalin (15 micrograms/kg) also increase the corticosterone secretion, the level of the hormone in the blood, however, becoming even lower. Combined action of these two substances involved a greater increase of the hormone concentration in the gland than in case of each of them separately. The hormone content in the blood remained low in this case, too. In perfusion of an isolated adrenal gland with met-enkephalin (15 micrograms/ml), no increase in the corticosterone concentration was observed either in the perfusate samples. The data obtained suggest that met-enkephalin activates synthesis of corticosteroids, on the one hand, and inhibits their secretion into the blood, on the other hand, whereas ACTH activates both these processes.", "PMC3500998": "Both regional differences in mucosal sensitivity and a gas chromatography-like process along the mucosal sheet have been separately proposed in two sets of earlier studies to produce different odorant-dependent activity patterns across the olfactory mucosa. This investigation evaluated, in one study, whether and to what degree these two mechanisms contribute to the generation of these activity patterns. Summated multiunit discharges were simultaneously recorded from lateral (LN) and medial (MN) sites on the bullfrog's olfactory nerve to sample the mucosal activity occurring near the internal and external nares, respectively. Precisely controlled sniffs of four odorants (benzaldehyde, butanol, geraniol, and octane) were drawn through the frog's olfactory sac in both the forward (H1) and reverse (H2) hale directions. By combining the four resulting measurements, LNH1, LNH2, MNH1, and MNH2, in different mathematical expressions, indexes reflecting the relative effects of the chromatographic process, regional sensitivity, and hale direction could be calculated. Most importantly, the chromatographic process and the regional sensitivity differences both contributed significantly to the mucosal activity patterns. However, their relative roles varied markedly among the four odorants, ranging from complete dominance by either one to substantial contributions from each. In general, the more strongly an odorant was sorbed by the mucosa, the greater was the relative effect of the chromatographic process; the weaker the sorption, the greater the relative effect of regional sensitivity. Similarly, the greater an odorant's sorption, the greater was the effect of hale direction. Other stimulus variables (sniff volume, sniff duration, and the number of molecules within the sniff) had marked effects upon the overall size of the response. For strongly sorbed odorants, the effect of increasing volume was positive; for a weakly sorbed odorant, it was negative. The reverse may be true for duration. In contrast, the effect of increasing the number of molecules was uniformly positive for all four odorants. However, there was little evidence that these other stimulus variables had a major influence upon the effects of the chromatographic process and regional sensitivity differences in their generation of mucosal activity patterns.", "PMC3966838": "We prospectively studied patients undergoing open-heart surgical procedures to evaluate the role of phrenic nerve palsy in the causation of the high incidence of pulmonary complications reported in these patients.

In 1, the left phrenic nerve became inexcitable; 2 had paresis of the left hemidiaphragm, and 2 had paresis of the right hemidiaphragm.

The reticular fibroblast cultures employed in these studies were 95%-100% pure on the basis of Mac-1, F4/80, MIV-51, T200, antifactor VIII and ER-TR7 monoclonal antibody staining. Further support for the fibroblastic nature of these cells was obtained from collagen and laminin analyses. Addition of stromal cell-depleted bone marrow cell suspensions to flasks of confluent reticular fibroblasts resulted in production and release of granulocytes, monocyte-macrophages, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors from the adherent layer for 4-8 weeks. Pluripotent spleen colony-forming units were detected during the first four weeks. Assay of reticular fibroblast conditioned medium for hemopoietic growth factors demonstrated production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity and stem-cell-activating factor. We did not detect any erythroid burst-promoting activity. These results suggest that reticular fibroblasts may play a role in the maintenance of pluripotent stem cells and in the proliferation and differentiation of cells committed to the granulocyte-monocyte lineage.", "PMC3623704": "The mitogenicity, lethal toxicity, and Shwartzman reaction of three derivatives of chemically synthesized 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid-linked 2,3-diacyloxyacylglucosamine-4-phosphate (KDO-GlcN-4-P) were determined. The compounds, A-301 (with di-3-hexadecanoyloxytetradecanoyl at the C-2 and C-3 positions), A-303 (di-3-tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoyl), and A-305 (3-dodecanoyloxytetradecanoyl and 3-tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoyl), induced a significant incorporation of [3H]thymidine into splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice. The compounds A-301 and A-303 showed lethality at a high dose of 50 micrograms per mouse in C57BL/6 mice sensitized with D-galactosamine, whereas A-305 caused toxicity even at a dose of 10 micrograms per mouse. However, the three compounds did not elicit the local Shwartzman reaction in rabbits. These findings indicate that the addition of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid enhances the mitogenic activity of 2,3-diacyloxyacylglucosamine-4-phosphate but does not affect the lethal toxicity and the induction of Shwartzman reaction.", "PMC3646009": "A pregnant employee must decide for herself on whether to keep working in the OR. Several factors (ie, constant standing/sitting, high-stress situations, exposure to infectious diseases and noxious chemicals) can be detrimental to a pregnant employee and her unborn infant, yet if precautions are taken, the OR can be a safe environment.", "PMC3723060": "The migratory pathways of neural crest-derived pigment cells were examined in two anurans, Xenopus laevis and Discoglossus pictus, and correlated with the distribution of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of these pathways. In Xenopus, melanophores in the trunk reach the dermis by initially migrating ventrally, between the neural tube and somites, and then by migrating through the somites to reach the subectodermal space. In Discoglossus, melanophores, iridophores, and xanthophores migrate laterally over the dorsal margin of the somites to reach the dermis. GAG was identified in the light microscope using alcian blue staining and in the electron microscope using ruthenium red staining. The ECM at the dorsal entrance to the lateral pathway in Xenopus and in young Discoglossus (at a stage prior to invasion by pigment cells) is filled with 25-50 nm chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan aggregates. When this ECM in Xenopus is digested in vivo with chondroitinase ABC, melanophores enter the lateral pathway. In older Discoglossus embryos, the migration of pigment cells into the lateral pathway is correlated with increases in the space between the ectoderm and somites and in the number of hyaluronate microfibrils. These observations suggest that chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan in the subectodermal ECM restricts the migration of pigment cells into the lateral pathway by limiting the amount of space for migration and possibly by acting as a less adhesive migratory substratum than the ventral pathway, and that in Discoglossus hyaluronate opens spaces permitting the migration of pigment cells directly over the dorsal margin of the somites.", "PMC3005937": "From 1980 to 1984 fifty-four patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma after operation and concluding chemotherapy with alkeran (n = 7) or cis-platin/alkeran +/- hexamethylmelamine (n = 47) as well as second-look laparotomy received follow-up radiotherapy either with the moving-strip technique (n = 35) or later the open-field technique (n = 19). 32 patients in CR received radiation therapy. 15 patients in CR are without relapse after undergoing open-field radiation therapy and a mean observation period of 25 months. At this point of time 5 of 17 patients had relapses under the moving-strip radiation treatment. The frequency of the relapses is apparently due to the very long periods of radiation and numerous interruptions in treatment. If residual tumors were present at the begin of ray therapy, a CR could only be achieved in cases where the previous monotherapy was with alkeran.", "PMC4020583": "Three adolescents with severe Crohn's ileocolitis developed osteonecrosis after receiving intravenous corticosteroids and parenteral nutrition, including 10% lipid infusion. Each had achieved clinical remission with therapy. However, several months following completion of therapy, each developed arthralgias and arthritis of weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing joints. Roentgenographic evaluation revealed osteonecrosis involving multiple joints. Osteonecrosis may result from the interference with blood flow to bone and has been produced in animals by infusion of lipid solutions and administration of corticosteroids. We report these cases of osteonecrosis as a probable complication of corticosteroid and lipid infusion in adolescents treated for severe Crohn's disease.", "PMC4207130": "1. Membrane potentials were recorded from single rods in the isolated retina of Bufo marinus while the ionic composition of the extracellular medium was rapidly changed. Substitution of 2 mM aspartate(-) for Cl(-) produced a prompt depolarization of horizontal cells, but no modification of either resting potential or response to light in receptor cells. This implies that feed-back from horizontal cells to receptor cells was not active.2. During substitution of choline(+) or Li(+) for Na(+), and during isosmotic substitution of sucrose for NaCl, the resting potential of receptor cells became more negative and responses to light were abolished. During exposure to K(+)-free medium, the resting potential became slightly more negative and the responses to light became larger and developed small after-depolarizations. Exposure to [K(+)](out) of four times normal resulted in permanent diminution of response magnitude and permanent change of response waveshape. Removal of Mg(2+), four times normal [Mg(2+)](out) or substitution of methylsulphate(-) for Cl(-) had no effect on resting potential or responses to light. With the exception of the small effects seen with altered [K(+)](out) these results are consistent with the receptor potential being generated by a light-induced decrease of membrane conductance to Na(+).3. Exposure to decreased [Ca(2+)](out) caused both a depolarization of the receptor membrane in the dark and an increase in the magnitude of the maximal response that could be evoked by a test stimulus. The magnitude of the increase in response equalled the magnitude of the depolarization. Exposure to increased [Ca(2+)](out) or steady background light caused both a steady hyperpolarization and a decrease in the magnitude of the maximal response that could be evoked by a test stimulus. For steady hyperpolarizations greater than 3.5 mV, whether caused by elevated [Ca(2+)](out) or steady background light, the decrease in response magnitude exceeded the magnitude of the hyperpolarization. These results imply that externally applied Ca(2+) ions mimic the effects of steady background lights, but the applied Ca(2+) ions must do more than merely decrease membrane conductance to Na(+).", "PMC2876781": "Resistance of tumor cells to multiple cytotoxic drugs is a major impediment to cancer chemotherapy. Multidrug resistance in human cells is determined by the mdr1 gene, encoding a high molecular weight membrane glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein). Complete primary structure of human P-glycoprotein has been determined from the cDNA sequence. The protein, 1280 amino acids long, consists of two homologous parts of approximately equal length. Each half of the protein includes a hydrophobic region with six predicted transmembrane segments and a hydrophilic region. The hydrophilic regions share homology with peripheral membrane components of bacterial active transport systems and include potential nucleotide-binding sites. These results are consistent with a function for P-glycoprotein as an energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells.", "PMC3192808": "The large flap sculptured facelift is a redraping rather than a pinching or pulling operation.

Two comparable groups, a total of 191 hay fever patients, were treated for 1 week. Symptom severity was assessed by the investigators before and at the end of the treatment (visual analogue scale), and daily by the patient (four-point rating scale). All symptoms improved to a similar degree in both groups. Differences between the two groups were not statistically significant, except for nasal symptoms in three cases as assessed by the visual analogue scale in one centre (better relief in the group given 120 mg terfenadine once daily). Tolerability was good and similar in both groups. The data presented show that in the treatment of hay fever 120 mg terfenadine given once daily is an effective, convenient and well tolerated alternative to the regimen of 60 mg terfenadine given twice daily.", "PMC3667038": "Relationships between respiratory health and environmental conditions (pollen, pollution and meteorology) are investigated in 204 subjects in four symptom groups in four geographical clusters in Tucson. Techniques used are principal components, factor and path analysis. Daily respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flows were recorded during a three-year period. Ambient pollutants, meteorological conditions and pollen types were monitored in or near the clusters. Factor-based scales, which are climate and season specific, are developed for the environmental variables. Three pollutant/meteorological scales represent 'Summer', 'Winter', and 'Humidity'. Four pollen scales represent early and late spring, summer and fall pollen types. Relationships between environmental variables, respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow are analyzed with path diagrams, after accounting for age, sex, smoking habits and stove type. The different effects of the environment on asthmatics, allergics and airways obstructive disease subjects have been demonstrated. Many relationships were found between environmental factors and respiratory responses. The pollutant and meteorological variables are related to respiratory symptoms and peak flow directly as well as through interactions with pollen types. Some of the largest positive coefficients are seen in association with seasonal pollen types, specifically, rhinitis and dyspnoea.", "PMC3206076": "The field trial for the oral immunization of foxes against rabies in the Federal Republic of Germany began in 1983 and since the end of 1985 has had the specific goal of the elimination of rabies in large interdependent areas of that country. To meet this goal it was necessary to develop methods for the large-scale production of the SAD (Street Alabama Dufferin) clone B19 vaccine as well as to develop a bait that could be mass-produced (the Tubingen fox bait). It has been shown that after a single vaccination campaign in the field approximately 75% of the fox population is immune to rabies and that after one or two repeated campaigns vaccination in many areas could be discontinued. Participation in the field trial in circumscribed border areas was extended to Italy in 1985 and to Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France in 1986. For the first time, through the use of oral immunization, a method for the elimination of rabies is available that is effective, safe, inexpensive, and practical. Further, this method meets the requirements of animal-protection societies, does not interfere with the preservation of endangered species, and therefore represents a significant political factor.", "PMC3621082": "Experiments in conscious goats were done to see whether heat production and respiratory evaporative heat loss show dynamic responses to changing core temperature at constant skin temperature. Core temperature was altered by external heat exchangers acting on blood temperature, while skin temperature was maintained constant by immersing the animals up to the neck in a rapidly circulating water bath. Core temperature was altered at various rates up to 0.9 degrees C/min. Step deviations of core temperature from control values were always followed by a positive time derivative of effector response, but never by a negative time derivative during sustained displacement of core temperature. Ramp experiments showed that the slopes at which heat production or heat loss rose with core temperature deviating from its control level grew smaller at higher rates of change of core temperature. It is concluded that neither heat production nor respiratory evaporative heat loss respond to the rate of change of core temperature. At constant skin temperature, thermoregulatory effector responses appear to be proportional to the degree to which core temperature deviates from its set level.", "PMC1885261": "The effects of repeated periods of weight loss and regain on metabolic rate and body composition were investigated in 11 obese women (mean weight 81.98 kg, height 1.61 m, body mass index 31.44 kg/m2) studied for 18 weeks through three consecutive cycles of 2 weeks dieting followed by 4 weeks ad libitum eating. Weight loss was achieved by a very low energy diet (1861 kJ/day). Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was measured by whole-body indirect calorimetry and body composition by a variety of standard in vivo methods. During the three diet periods mean weight losses were 4.44, 3.29 and 2.98 kg although the mean overall weight loss from week 0 to 18 was only 5.93 kg. The proportion of weight lost as fat was estimated as between 67 and 105 per cent of the weight lost depending on the body composition methodology employed. Absolute BMR decreased in response to dieting by 545, 285 and 286 kJ/day. When corrected for body weight and FFM only the decreases in the first diet period were significant (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001 respectively). BMR had returned to normal following each 4-week ad libitum period and by the end of the study absolute BMR and BMR/kg FFM had not changed significantly, despite a significant loss of weight. Consequently BMR/kg was increased (P less than 0.01), indicative of the loss of adipose tissue. We have found no evidence in this group of obese women that weight cycling leads to a progressive decrease in BMR or increase in the proportion of body fat.", "PMC3542330": "Zenoderm (Ethicon Ltd., Edinburgh, Scotland) is porcine skin dermis specially treated so as to be weakly antigenic when implanted. Its use as an extradural spinal and nerve root membrane to reduce postoperative adhesions after laminectomy was tested in 22 rabbits with laminectomy in the second and fourth lumbar vertebra. The sites were reviewed histologically two to 36 weeks after operation. Histologic sections showed that Zenoderm was initially surrounded by hematoma that organized into fibrous tissue and, later, bone. When Zenoderm was placed immediately adjacent to the dura, dense adhesions formed, which were slower to resolve than those in the control sites. The rate of Zenoderm resorption was variable. In general, Zenoderm did not excite excessive fibrous tissue formation and was slowly replaced by bone. Contrary to the experience of others, it was unusual to find adhesions between the laminectomy site, and the dura began disappearing after six to nine weeks. In rabbits, Zenoderm is unlikely to prevent adhesions forming after lumbar disc surgery. The resorption rate is variable, and laminectomy sites are unsuitable for the investigation of material for the prevention of spinal dural adhesions.", "PMC3827254": "From August, 1976, through May, 1986, 111 patients with brain metastasis from lung cancer received various treatments according to their systemic conditions. Forty-two out of 55 patients without systemic metastasis were selected for surgical removal followed by radiation therapy, and the remaining 13 inoperable patients received radiation therapy alone. The median survival of the former group was 14.5 months with a 1-year survival rate of 57.2%, and was 11.0 months with a 1-year survival rate of 38.1% for the latter group. Twenty patients among the former group received intraoperative radiation therapy, and the result obtained was the same as that of the remaining 22 patients treated by surgery and conventional external radiation therapy. As to the conservative therapy applied for the 47 cases with systemic metastasis, radiation therapy, surgical decompression or steroid therapy were planned. The overall median survival of patients of this group was 3.5 months, with a 6-month survival rate of 27.7%. Radiation therapy combined with cisplatin was evaluated to be effective, showing more than 50% reduction of tumor volume in 73.9% of patients. The surgical removal of metastatic tumors should be considered for patients without systemic metastasis, and should also be followed by radiation therapy. Such cases would be expected to survive for more than 1 year, whereas there is no suitable treatment for patients with systemic metastasis.", "PMC4570792": "Rabbit retinas were incubated in medium containing 500 microCi of [(3)H]leucine for 3 min, and transferred to medium without isotope for another 7, 17, 37, 57, and 117 min. Retinal pieces were fixed in paraformaldehyde and osmium tetroxide and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were autoradiographed with Ilford L4 emulsion, and a quantitative study of silver grain distribution per Muller cell portion, and per Muller cell organelle, was carried out. Grain density per unit area was high over the middle cell portion at each incubation interval. Silver grains were numerous over background cytoplasm (which comprised free ribosomes) but their percentage was constant at all times and their relative concentration low. Silver grains were numerous and highly concentrated, at pulse incubation, over the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and then decreased sharply, but this decline coincided with an increase over the Golgi complex, peaking at 20 min. Another peak appeared over the cell periphery at 60 min. These findings suggest the simultaneous synthesis of two types of proteins in Muller cells; structural proteins in background cytoplasm and proteins of secretory type in the RER.", "PMC3575807": "The aim of this work has been the study of the mechanism of lymph formation and drainage in the upper limb in patients with monolateral lymphoedema (15 limbs, L) in comparison with the apparently healthy limb (S) as well as with a control group (8 limbs, C).

Results were expressed as percentage of the id removed from the injection site 1 and 6 hr pi, mean T6%/h it is (T6-T1)/5 and percentage lymph nodes uptake at the same times. Mean T6%/h is significantly different between C and L, but not between L and S, while lymph node uptake at 6 hr shows a significant difference even between C and S. Quantitative lymphoscintigraphy appears to be a feasible indicator of early changes in the lymph pathophysiology and supports the hypothesis that lymphoedema generally arises from a predisposing congenital pathology.", "PMC4096393": "It was found in a study on numbers and size of aggregated lymph nodules (ALN) occurring in the small intestine of 2 groups of one-year-old hares from 2 different localities that: the macroscopically visible ALN were regularly present only in jejunum and ileum. In jejunum, the numbers of ALN ranged from 2 to 9 while in ileum from 1 to 3. The surface area of individual ALN ranged from 10 to 530 mm2 and more than one half of ALN had an surface area of 50 to 150 mm2. The total surface area of all ALN occurring in the small intestine showed considerable individual differences and ranged from 410 to 1,320 mm2. There were no correlations between the numbers and size of ALN on the one hand and the origin of hares (i.e. locality) and the length of their small intestine on the other.", "PMC3826001": "The quantitation of platelets in peripheral blood is a well-recognized tool. However, other platelet parameters that recently have become available on a routine basis with the introduction of automated cell sizers may become increasingly important in evaluating the integrity of the thrombocytic function. These parameters include mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet-crit (PCT). This study established reliable reference ranges for these platelet parameters while taking into consideration the effects of age and sex in a study population of 447 normal persons. There was an inverse, nonlinear relationship between MPV and platelet count, with no statistical difference (P greater than 0.05) seen between males and females. Platelet-crit showed no variation with respect to age or sex, however, a direct, linear relationship was suggested between PCT and platelet count. These relationships provide a better understanding of these platelet parameters and may contribute to their use as helpful diagnostic aids.", "PMC2868010": "We have developed an in vitro translation system from heat-shocked and normal Drosophila cultured cells. The lysates retain regulation of translation typical of the whole cells from which they were prepared, both when programmed by endogenous mRNA and when RNA-dependent. These systems have been used to investigate the mechanism of shutdown of normal protein synthesis and selection of heat shock mRNAs for translation in heat shock in Drosophila. Supplementation of intact RNA-dependent lysates with separated ribosome or supernatant fractions from normal or heat-shocked translation systems showed the normal supernatant fraction could \"rescue\" normal protein synthesis in a heat shock lysate. Normal ribosomes had no rescuing activity and neither heat shock fraction affected translation in normal lysates. Reconstitution of the system from separated ribosomes and supernatant in normal and mixed combinations showed heat shock and normal ribosomes were both competent to support normal protein synthesis with normal supernatant. Heat shock supernatant did not support normal protein synthesis with ribosomes from either source. We conclude that the factors regulating translation in heat-shocked Drosophila cells are soluble factors in the lysate and that the soluble factors present in the normal lysate are dominant.", "PMC3820509": "Between January 1985 and May 1986, following completion of a pilot study, a main study concerning the possible association between Reye's syndrome and salicylates was conducted. Twenty-seven patients with stage II or deeper Reye's syndrome whose diagnoses were confirmed by an expert panel and who had appropriate antecedent illnesses (chickenpox, respiratory illness, or gastrointestinal illness) prior to the onset of Reye's syndrome were compared with 140 controls matched for age, race (black or not black), and type and timing of onset of antecedent illness. Controls were selected from the same hospital, emergency room, or school as case-patients or were identified by random-digit telephone dialing. As in the pilot study, a strong statistical association with ingestion of salicylates during the antecedent illness and prior to the onset of Reye's syndrome was observed (odds ratio, 40; lower 95% confidence limit, 5.8). Analysis of the independent risk of aspirin and nonaspirin salicylates revealed a significant association with aspirin (odds ratio, 26; lower 95% confidence limit, 6.4); the independent risk of nonaspirin salicylates could not be assessed because only two cases were not exposed to aspirin. Assessment of epidemiologic issues of concern, including case-control differences in the severity of the antecedent illness, did not explain the high odds ratios that were observed. The high percentage of patients with Reye's syndrome exposed to salicylates (greater than or equal to 90%) in this and prior studies suggests that, though the reported incidence of Reye's syndrome has declined in recent years, concomitant with a decline in salicylate use among children, a majority of Reye's syndrome cases may be attributable to salicylate use.", "PMC2896192": "Incubation of [gamma-32P]ATP with a molar excess of the soluble, homogeneous ATPase from beef heart mitochondria (F1) results in binding of substrate primarily in a single, very high affinity (KA = 10(12) M-1) catalytic site and in a slow rate of hydrolysis characteristic of single site catalysis. Subsequent addition of millimolar concentrations of nonradioactive ATP as a cold chase, sufficient to fill catalytic sites on the enzyme, results in an acceleration of hydrolysis of bound radioactive ATP of as much as 10(6)-fold, that is, to Vmax rates (Cross, R.L., Grubmeyer, C., and Penefsky, H.S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12101-12105). For this reason, it was proposed that the high affinity catalytic site is a normal catalytic site on the molecule. Recently, Bullough et al. (Bullough, D.A., Verburg, J.G., Yoshida, M., and Allison, W.A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11675-11683) reported that when 5 to 20 microM concentrations of nonradioactive ATP were added as a cold chase to an enzyme-substrate complex consisting of F1 and ATP bound to the high affinity catalytic site, hydrolysis of the chase was commensurate with the turnover rate of the enzyme, whereas the hydrolysis of bound ATP was considerably slower. These authors suggested that the high affinity catalytic site on F1 is not a normal catalytic site. This paper shows, in experiments with a rapid mixing-chemical quench apparatus, that hydrolysis of ATP bound in the high affinity catalytic site is accelerated to Vmax rates following addition of 5 microM ATP as a cold chase. Hydrolysis of bound ATP appears to precede that of the chase. The weight of the available evidence continues to support the original suggestion that the high affinity catalytic site of beef heart F1 is a normal catalytic site.", "PMC3220518": "The hamster cheek pouch microcirculation was used to investigate the effects of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on leukocyte adhesion to microvascular walls by means of intravital microscopy.

An inverse relationship between PAF concentration and number of adhering white cells per 100-microns length was found in venules ranging in diameter from 10 to 60 microns (grouped into 10-microns intervals). Importantly, the PAF-induced adhesion of leukocytes lasted for the 3-h experimental period.

They share similar clinical and embryologic characteristics, are frequently difficult to diagnose, and all require surgical treatment. From December 1974 to January 1985, 22 patients were operated upon on the Pediatric Surgical Service for congenital cystic disease of the lung. There were eight females and 14 males, ranging in age from 1 day to 18 years; 12 were under 6 months of age, and 14 were under one year. There were 7 CAMs, 5 extralobar pulmonary sequestrations, 5 intralobar pulmonary sequestrations, 3 bronchogenic cysts, and 3 cystic lobes caused by CLO. One patient had bilateral pulmonary sequestrations, intralobar on one side and extralobar on the other, with both sharing a common systemic artery arising from the infradiaphragmatic aorta. All except two asymptomatic patients presented with either progressive respiratory distress or recurrent pulmonary infections, and had cystic changes noted on chest roentgenograms. The differentiation of these congenital lesions from resolvable inflammatory cysts is important. Diagnosis was aided by selective utilization of barium contrast studies, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and arteriography. Operation consisted of resection alone of the extralobar pulmonary sequestrations and bronchogenic cysts, and total lobectomy in CAM, intralobar sequestration, and CLO. One infant with CAM died 1 day postoperatively from bilateral hypoplastic lungs.

In immunodiffusion studies, the antibodies raised with the re-crystallized enzyme were highly specific to ornithine aminotransferase. To show localization of ornithine aminotransferase in normal rat tissues, clear immunohistochemical staining of this enzyme through the inner mitochondrial membrane in paraffin sections was achieved with Fab'-horseradish peroxidase conjugates. Strong immunoreactivity was present in cerebral neurons, hepatocytes, and epithelial cells of renal tubuli, gut mucous membranes, and ocular tissues. Specific distribution of ornithine aminotransferase was found in ependymal cell groups: namely, epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, pigmented and nonpigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary body. and Muller cells and pigment epithelium of the retina.", "PMC3814715": "This study was designed to examine the effect of inflammatory reaction elicited by percutaneous tube on bone induction.

In order to evaluate incorporation of percutaneous tubes, bone matrix and subcutaneous tissue, demineralizing bone matrix was implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of rats and was exposed to interaction with inflammatory conditions. Inhibition to the induction of cartilage and bone by the inflammatory process could be clearly demonstrated. It is suggested that the low pH levels, typical to enzymes operative in inflammation are a direct cause for inhibition of chondro and osteogenesis.

There were eight male and six female patients. Their average age was 61 years. The hip was involved in 14 joints (femoral component 11 times, acetabulum 7, and greater trochanter once). One patient presented with granulomatous pseudotumors of the knee. The principal findings included increasing pain and radiographic evidence of loosening occurring on average 2.7 years following the implant. This was followed by a characteristic and gradually developing radiographic pattern of discrete rounded lucencies. These developed into large ovoid lytic areas, destroying both methylmethacrylate and bone. Histologically, the appearances were characterized by histiocytic infiltration and the presence of multiple foreign body giant cells. Foreign material was identified in 9 of 11 cases.

Anthropometric and skinfold measurements were used to estimate lean body mass in eight male Asian subjects. They remained for 36 h in a metabolic chamber wearing a calorimeter suit. A ventilated hood and differential gas analysers were used to measure oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. While the subjects were sitting inactive, the KM respirometer indicated a mean energy expenditure which was significantly lower than with the calorimeter suit or with the ventilated hood. During exercise on an ergometer at 25 W and 75 W the respirometer gave readings of energy expenditure which were also significantly lower than either the ventilated hood or the calorimeter suit. The daily energy expenditure expressed in MJ for a standard body weight of 60 kg (MJ/60 kg) measured from the calorimeter suit was 9.79 MJ; from the ventilated hood, 9.51 MJ; from the diary-respirometer method, 8.30 MJ. The mean energy intake, measured for 10 consecutive d after the the subjects had left the metabolic room was 7.87 MJ, while during their stay in the metabolic room, their spontaneous intake was 7.74 MJ. The diary-respirometer technique tends to cumulate the errors from an incorrect time and motion recording and the potential lack of representativeness of the measurement of the energy cost of the activities. In the present study, it seems that the discrepancy observed between the results of the different methods can be attributed almost entirely to the underestimation of the energy cost of the activities by the respirometer. Contrary to our expectation the diary-respirometer technique does not seem to overestimate systematically the daily energy expenditure.", "PMC3948463": "A 7-month-old male presented with lethargy and failure to thrive.

This study emphasizes the need for assuring maternal dietary adequacy during pregnancy and after birth.", "PMC3098214": "The persistence of Langerhans cells, melanocytes and ABH red cell antigens in human epidermal cell cultures derived from neonatal foreskin explants has been investigated. Langerhans cells were recognised via the detection of ATPase activity and by immunohistochemical staining for T6 and HLA-DR antigens. Melanocytes were detected by the dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) technique; whilst the presence of red cell antigens was confirmed by immunohistochemical tests using monoclonal anti-A, anti-B, and anti-H antibodies. Langerhans cells were not detected in the cultured epidermis, and few melanocytes were found more than 0.2 mm from the periphery of the explants. However, both Langerhans cells and melanocytes were found to persist for up to 4 weeks in the explants themselves. Red cell antigens, consistent with the blood group of the donor infant, were consistently detected on the surface of the differentiating keratinocytes throughout their in vitro lifespan. The significance of these findings is discussed.", "PMC3976404": "The interaction between chlorpromazine (CPZ) and lithium on renal concentrating ability was studied in rats fed a Li-containing diet for 8 weeks (plasma-Li 0.6-0.7 mmol/l). CPZ (15 mg/kg daily orally) reduced the polydipsia and increased the ability to concentrate the urine upon water deprivation in rats treated with lithium. CPZ also reduced systolic blood pressure, but had no effect on the glomerular filtration rate or plasma levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in hydrated rats treated with lithium. However, CPZ prevented the rise in plasma AVP levels observed in lithium-polyuric rats in response to dehydration. During anaesthesia CPZ partially restored the impaired anti-diuretic response to exogenous AVP in rats treated with lithium. CPZ had no influence on plasma-Li levels in rats treated with lithium. It is suggested that CPZ by unknown mechanisms interferes with the effects of lithium on the water permeability response to AVP.", "PMC2856169": "We have found elevated IgA class mumps and Coxsackie B4 virus antibodies and IgA/IgG antibody ratios in type 1 diabetic patients. However, IgA class herpes simplex (HSV1) virus antibodies showed no difference between patients and controls. To study the possible contribution of genetically polymorphic immunoglobulin markers to the pronounced IgA class reactivity Ig allotypes (Gm, A2m and Km determinants) were compared to virus antibodies in diabetic patients and healthy controls. Ig allotypes were equally distributed in both groups suggesting that the genes coding for these structures are not in close linkage disequilibrium with susceptibility gene(s) for type 1 diabetes. Accordingly, pronounced IgA class immune response in diabetic patients is hardly due to Ig allotype related factors. Patients had elevated IgA class mumps and Coxsackie B4 antibodies and IgA/IgG antibody ratios independently of the Gm phenotype group. In healthy subjects but not in diabetic patients IgA class mumps antibody levels and IgA/IgG mumps antibody ratios significantly correlated with the Gm phenotypes. Such Gm association was not observed in Coxsackie B4 or HSV1 antibodies. These results suggest that though Gm phenotypes have a general effect on mumps specific antibody response, some other factors than Ig allotypes are responsible for the elevated IgA class mumps and Coxsackie B antibody levels and IgA/IgG antibody ratios in type 1 diabetes.", "PMC3666032": "Differences in the reactivity and in the influence of the epithelium on responsiveness of canine 2nd and 3rd generation airway smooth muscle were examined. Epithelium-containing 3rd generation airways produced a greater maximum contraction and were more sensitive to methacholine and histamine, but not to KCl, than corresponding 2nd generation airways. Mechanical removal of the epithelium increased the sensitivity to methacholine and histamine in 2nd generation airways; there was also an increase in the maximum response elicited by histamine, but not by methacholine, in epithelium-free preparations. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity to or the maximum response elicited by histamine or methacholine in epithelium-containing and epithelium-free 3rd generation airways. Epithelium removal had no effect on KCl-induced responses in either airway region. The inhibitory effects of verapamil (1 microM) against KCl- and methacholine-induced responses were identical in preparations containing and lacking the epithelium. The results support the postulate of an epithelium-derived inhibitory factor modulating airway smooth muscle reactivity. Furthermore, the influence of the epithelium exhibits regional differences, being greater in larger airways.", "PMC3303834": "The effect of GnRH was studied on progesterone (P4), oestradiol-17 beta (E2) and testosterone (T) secretion by porcine luteal cells from the 13th day of the oestrous cycle and the 18th day of pregnancy. Trypsin-dispersed luteal cells (5 X 10(4) cells/ml) were incubated in medium 199 with 10% calf serum with or without GnRH in doses of 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mg/ml and with 1 microgram LH and 50 U/ml hCG. The concentration of P4, E2 and T in the medium was estimated by radioimmunological method after 6 hours of incubation. The results showed that GnRH had no effect on the secretion of the investigated steroid hormones by luteal cells from cyclic sows. GnRH at a dose of 10 g inhibited E2 secretion and at a dose of 1 ng T secretion by cells from pregnant sows. LH and hCG stimulated release of P4 by luteal cells in both physiological stages. The conclusion drawn was that GnRH does not act directly on luteal cells of cyclic sows but may inhibit E2 and T secretion by cells of pregnant sows.", "PMC3405069": "Biopsy forceps with a suture needle were developed. They will enable to increase considerably the efficacy and accuracy of diagnostic procedures in early cancer and precancerous conditions, and the differentiation of malignant and benign affections of internal organs as well.", "PMC3675092": "Serum lipids and lipoprotein patterns were prospectively analyzed in 33 previously untreated patients with active chronic inflammatory arthritides during different anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying drug regimens. Before treatment the lipoprotein pattern was characterized by low cholesterol concentrations in all lipoprotein fractions and low triglyceride concentrations in the very-low-density lipoprotein fraction as well as in the high-density lipoprotein fraction. During treatment with prednisolone combined with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide (n = 10), a reduction of the disease activity was achieved and the lipoprotein pattern was normalized; similar results were noted in a small group of patients (n = 4) treated with prednisolone alone while nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy (n = 9) neither significantly affected the lipoprotein pattern nor the inflammatory activity measured by the acute-phase reactants. The long-term treatment with penicillamine (n = 4) and chloroquine (n = 6) induced both a clinical remission of the disease and a reduction of the inflammatory activity. The lipoprotein concentrations started to reverse to the normal values during penicillamine treatment. In contrast, in the chloroquine-treated group the alterations in lipoprotein lipid concentrations were further pronounced, ie, the cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in serum and the very-low-density lipoprotein fraction decreased.", "PMC3840923": "The reported incidence of thyroid carcinoma in Hashimoto's thyroiditis varies widely. For this reason the specific subpopulation of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a solitary cold nodule was analyzed. Between 1972 and 1984 we operated on 146 consecutive patients with solitary cold nodules and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. There were 47 carcinomas, for an incidence of 32%. The mean age of the 146 patients was 43 1/2 years (median 44 years), with 126 females and 20 males. There was a history of prior head and neck radiation exposure in 54 patients, with a 33% incidence of thyroid carcinoma. The 92 patients without a history of radiation exposure had a 31.5% incidence of carcinoma. The frequency of multicentricity (bilateralism) was 33% in the group that underwent radiation and 24% in the group that did not. To date, with a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, there have been no deaths and no evidence of recurrence. In conclusion, we report a 32% incidence of thyroid carcinoma in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a solitary cold nodule, with no apparent difference between the patients with or without a history of radiation exposure, although there was a higher incidence of bilateralism (33% versus 24%) in the carcinomas of the patients with a history of head and neck irradiation. We suggest that the operative management of these patients is total thyroidectomy for those with a history of head and neck radiation and thyroid lobectomy for patients with no history of radiation, followed by contralateral lobectomy if a carcinoma is demonstrated.", "PMC4627230": "For 3 months, 259 cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from nonpatient environmental sources and 262 cultures from 16 infected patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Shriners Burns Hospital were typed by a combined system with a high degree of reliability. Sinks were major sources of environmental contamination. Serotypes 1 and 2 were the predominant types found in patients, and they were most prevalent among typable strains from sinks. Strain designations were made on the basis of similarities in data from serological and phage typing. All nontypable strains were typed by pyocin production. Two infected patients carried different strains of P. aeruginosa that remained the same type for 45 days, even though their beds in ICU were approximately 6 feet apart. Cross-contamination from patient to patient and spread of infection by nursing personnel were eliminated as major modes of transmission because nasopharyngeal swabs, hair samples, and hands of nursing staff were consistently negative. Splashing of water from contaminated sinks to fomites was suggested as a possible mode of transfer for this infectious agent.", "PMC3759938": "Microtubules were purified from porcine brain by two cycles of temperature-dependent assembly and disassembly, then microtubule associated proteins, MAP-1, MAP-2, and tau, were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of radioiodinated polypeptides were compared with each other by means of mixed sample experiments, and the following results were obtained. Subspecies of MAP-1 (355-345 and 325 kDa) showed about 33% homology in the tryptic peptide maps. Structural homology of MAP-1 and MAP-2 was very low; only 3 out of 40 peptide spots of MAP-2 were identical with those of MAP-1-C. Subspecies of tau proteins (65 and 60 kDa) were very closely related. Structural similarity between MAP-2 and tau was very low. MAP-1 from porcine brain and rat brain showed very high structural homology.", "PMC3282753": "This paper reports the use of a 10 MHz pulsed A-scan ultrasound system to measure the thickness of subcutaneous fat and its comparison with two other established techniques. Measurements using both ultrasound and Harpenden's skin calipers were made on the abdomen, over the scapula region, over the triceps and on the front of the thigh. Computerised axial tomography (CAT) was also used to obtain measurements of subcutaneous fat over the abdomen. In most instances the different techniques were significantly correlated. The ultrasound method showed non-dependency or bias upon the size of measurement when compared with the other two techniques. In addition, the ultrasound method was considered more accurate, reproducible and sensitive compared with the caliper technique and much more convenient than CAT scanning. However, the presence of septa at some sites in the more obese subjects was revealed by CAT scanning and made ultrasound assessment at these sites more difficult.", "PMC3782641": "To investigate the mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias induced by epinephrine in dogs with hypokalemia, 30 adult mongrel dogs were separated into a control group (n = 13) and a hypokalemia group (n = 17). In the hypokalemia group, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (5 g/kg body weight) was infused into the colon. In both groups, the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium were measured every 15 minutes for 60 minutes. The mean (+/- standard deviation) serum potassium level of the hypokalemia group decreased significantly from 3.81 +/- 0.21 to 2.92 +/- 0.36 mEq/liter; there were no significant changes in other electrolytes. After 60 minutes, epinephrine (10 micrograms/kg) was injected intravenously in the hypokalemia and control groups, and the arrhythmia ratio (the number of ventricular ectopic beats divided by the total heart rate) was calculated for 5 minutes. Each group was further classified into subgroups of dogs with an arrhythmia ratio higher or lower than 10%. An arrhythmia ratio over 10% was observed in 7.7% of the control group and 53% of the hypokalemia group. Immediately after 5 minutes of epinephrine injection, myocardial mitochondria and plasma membrane fraction were prepared from each group. Mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity of plasma membrane fraction were determined. Significant increases in both mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity were observed in the dogs with hypokalemia and an arrhythmia ratio greater than 10%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3349666": "The growth and metastasis of four commonly used experimental tumour lines have been compared after the implantation of cells into a lobe of the liver, the spleen, the left kidney, the peritoneal cavity, the thorax, the right thigh muscle, subcutaneously into the dorsolumbar region and intravenously into the tail vein or the right femoral vein. This was done to assess the importance of site in affecting metastatic distribution, and to determine whether any general conclusions could be drawn as to the role of this factor. Tumours grew at variable rates in different sites, but this did not affect the extent or distribution of metastasis. Each line gave a characteristic pattern that could be considerably modified by site. For example, in the spleen, metastasis was always extensively to the liver; in the kidney, and to some extent in the muscle, metastasis was similar to that obtained for intravenously injected cells; in the peritoneal cavity or thorax, metastasis was usually lower than from other sites; and in the liver, the metastasis to other lobes of the liver and to the lungs was modified. Many of these findings could be explained by both specific and non-specific factors operating at each site. It is suggested that interactions at the primary site of tumour growth may be very important in affecting metastasis, and that in the future more attention should be given to this factor in order to make progress in understanding tumour spread.", "PMC3272818": "The present paper describes a method of subtyping of properdin factor B (BF) using polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing followed by immunoblotting, and the distribution of BF subtypes in Japanese patients with IgA nephropathy or idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) along with controls. BF*F allele was splitted into two suballeles, named BF*FA and BF*FB. There were significant differences in the BF suballele frequencies between the IMN patient group and the control group. A significant association of IMN with the BF FA subtype (p less than 0.05) and with the BF FB subtype (p less than 0.001) was also found. BF*FB may be a susceptibility suballele to IMN rather than BF*FA.", "PMC3485014": "Antitumor synergism occurs with two drugs in sequence when the second drug is given at the time of maximal regrowth of residual leukemia and peak humoral stimulatory activity (HSA). To determine if this enhancement relates to a host derived HSA, studies were conducted in Lewis x brown Norway F1 rats bearing brown Norway myelocytic leukemia. A significant cure rate was observed in rats treated initially with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and then given injections of 10(6) leukemia cells and treated with a second 2-day course of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine in every-8-h s.c. injections in the 6-day period after the initial drug. No effect on survival of the initial drug or of the second drug given at intervals after day 6 was noted. This result is consistent with the efficacy of treatment at the time of peak HSA and tumor growth. The direct effect of HSA on tumor sensitivity to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine was evaluated by 18-h incubations of leukemia and HSA, followed by bioassay. Increased survival and high cure rates were observed when compared with cultured cells in normal serum. These studies support the notion that host derived factors operative during drug induced aplasia stimulate tumor growth and thereby, if the drugs are properly timed, increase sensitivity to cycle active agents.", "PMC4015988": "Marrow specimens from six patients with anorexia nervosa and three with involuntary starvation were examined for the presence of gelatinous transformation and marrow cell necrosis. Five of the patients had pancytopenia. Acanthocytes were present in the circulation of all nine. In only two patients was marrow cellularity adequate. Gelatinous transformation was present in every marrow specimen and was of a marked degree in eight. Marrow cell necrosis was identified in all nine marrow specimens. The necrosis was extensive in one specimen, focal in the others and limited to the areas of gelatinous transformation. Severe malnutrition was the single element common to all the patients.", "PMC1888835": "The human stomach has a normal circadian rhythm of intragastric acidity characterized by increasing acidity during the day and peaks in the early hours of the morning. Eating causes a transient decrease of intragastric acidity. Acid appears to be the permissive factor in peptic ulcer disease and to be responsible for symptoms; the patient with duodenal ulcer may secrete too much acid. Pharmacological control of gastric acid secretion will speed ulcer healing. Modern regimens, which typically use a bedtime dose of an H2-receptor antagonist, produce a pulse of decreased acidity. Intragastric acidity is decreased during the night and early morning, leaving a normal profile of acidity during the day and early evening. Higher or more frequent doses of an antisecretory agent can produce a more profound decrease of 24-h intragastric acidity. Theoretical problems associated with a sustained or profound decrease of 24-h intragastric acidity include the threat of enteric infection and infestation, potential bacterial overgrowth with possible N-nitrosamine formation, and drug-induced hypergastrinaemia. In light of these potential problems, for the management of simple peptic ulceration, it appears sensible to use the minimum intervention required. Bedtime H2-receptor blockade is one such regimen. The more potent antisecretory regimens can be used for difficult clinical problems such as the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, intractable duodenal ulceration, and severe oesophagitis.", "PMC3312296": "Reporting colorectal cancer comprises two phases: the careful collection of pathological data; and the division of patients into groups with differing prognoses. Dukes' classification of rectal cancer was the outcome of this dual approach. It evolved over many years, and full details of its final form were not published until 1958, towards the end of his career. Others modified the classification during its evolution, and numerous rival pathological and clinicopathological systems now exist. The resulting confusion that surrounds the Dukes classification may make it impossible to compare pathological findings and the results of treatment between different centres. The importance of meticulous dissection and examination of surgical specimens is emphasised and a simple set of recommendations made. It is shown how modern statistical methods may identify pathological variables that have independent clinical importance. On the basis of this information a new system of prognostic categorisation for patients receiving apparently curative surgery for rectal cancer has been developed, which is superior to the Dukes classification in that it can place many more patients into groups with clear prognostic implications.", "PMC4333397": "A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.", "PMC3281007": "Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF) has been reported to increase the leukocyte count in subhuman primates subjected to total-body irradiation and in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We administered this substance to 19 patients with breast cancer or melanoma treated with high-dose combination chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support. Groups of three or four patients were treated with 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, or 32.0 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day of glycosylated rHuGM-CSF by continuous intravenous infusion for 14 days, beginning three hours after bone marrow infusion. Total leukocyte and granulocyte recovery was accelerated in these patients as compared with 24 historical controls matched for age, diagnosis, and treatment. Leukocyte counts (mean +/- SD) obtained 14 days after transplantation were 1511 +/- 1003 per microliter in patients given 2 to 8 micrograms per kilogram per day, 2575 +/- 2304 in those given 16 micrograms, and 3120 +/- 1744 in those given 32 micrograms, as compared with 863 +/- 645 per microliter in the controls. No consistent effect on platelet counts was noted. Toxic effects were generally mild and not clearly dose-related in patients given 2 to 16 micrograms per kilogram per day. Edema, weight gain, or myalgias occurred in all patients given 32 micrograms per kilogram; marked weight gain, generalized edema, pleural effusions, and hypotension developed in two patients, one of whom also had acute renal failure. Our results indicate that rHuGM-CSF can accelerate myeloid recovery after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation, over a range of doses that can be tolerated. In this setting the ability to increase the dose is limited by the development of myalgias and fluid retention.", "PMC2805716": "We reviewed 397 cases of microbial keratitis examined at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA, U.S.A., from January 1982 through December 1985.

Cosmetic contact lenses accounted for 59 (44%) of lens-related cases, aphakic contact lenses 44 (32%), and therapeutic (bandage) contact lenses 33 (24%). Fifty-three microbial keratitis cases associated with contact lens wear were culture-positive: 28 (52%) were gram-positive, and 19 (36%) were gram-negative. Mixed cultures, fungi, and Acanthamoeba accounted for two cases (4%) each.

Transformed (Cl 16) cells were more sensitive toward the cytotoxic effect of methotrexate (MTX) than their normal counterpart Cl 8 cells. The disposition of endogenous L-homocysteine (Hcy) was investigated in these two cell lines after MTX exposure. Both nonmalignant and transformed cells exported Hcy into the extracellular medium, and only small amounts were retained within the cells. The Hcy efflux from the malignant cells was markedly increased after MTX exposure (0.5-10 microM), and this effect was almost completely prevented by 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF), whereas treatment with thymidine plus hypoxanthine did not inhibit the MTX-dependent Hcy efflux. Cytotoxic concentration of MCA reduced rather than increased the Hcy efflux from these cells. High concentrations of MTX (greater than 10 microM) were required to increase the release of Hcy from nonmalignant cells. The enhancement of Hcy export from the malignant cells in the presence of MTX was not associated with cellular build-up of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy), indicating that the amount of intracellular Hcy was kept below the level required for inhibition or reversion of the AdoHcy hydrolase reaction. MTX-dependent Hcy efflux probably reflects cellular deficiency of 5-methyl-THF required for the salvage of Hcy to methionine and may therefore be a measure of lack of this reduced folate relative to the metabolic demand.", "PMC3607592": "Heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, its distribution and organ blood flows were measured, using the microsphere technique (15 micron in diameter microspheres), in 5, 12 and 24 months old conscious male rats. Each rat was then infused with isoproterenol (0.2 microgram/kg.min) and the measurements were repeated. It was found that resting cardiovascular values do not change within the age range studied, with the exception of the renal blood flow. After infusion of isoproterenol, the heart rate and cardiac output increased in the youngest group while only smaller increase in heart rate and no significant changes in cardiac output were found in the oldest group. Similarly, organ blood flow increased after isoproterenol in all organs studied in the 5 months group, with significance levels reached in the case of blood supply to the right and left ventricles, total heart, skin and carcass. In contrast, infusion of the same dose of isoproterenol in the 24 months old animals did not elicit any significant changes in the regional blood flow. Thus, the response to beta-adrenergic stimulation is depressed with advancing age. This finding of decreased in vivo response to beta-adrenergic stimulation may be a mechanism for the altered cardiovascular performance during stress seen in aged animals and man.", "PMC1326249": "On the basis of one case, the authors report about an exceptional tumor of the larynx: malignant fibrous histiocytoma. This tumor, belonging to the soft-tissue sarcomas, usually develops in the limbs.

A histological grading associated to other deciding prognostic factors, such as the size and depth of the tumor and the quality of exeresis, would demonstrate a prognostic correlation. The evolution is characterized by frequent local recurrence and metastases. The treatment is mainly surgical, with as extensive an exeresis as possible at once.

Antisera from two separate broiler breeder flocks with known fowl-cholera-vaccination histories were collected just before the birds were challenged with virulent strain X-73 P. multocida. A potassium thiocyanate (KSCN)-extracted antigen, a capsular (CAP) antigen, a lipopolysaccharide-protein antigen, and heat-stable, salt-soluble antigen were all suitable as ELISA plate-coating antigens. Filtered and unfiltered sonicates of the CU strain of P. multocida were also suitable ELISA plate antigens. The results suggested that different plate antigens were detecting different populations of antibodies formed in response to fowl cholera vaccinations. When antibody titers were correlated with survival after challenge, the KSCN and the CAP plate antigens placed more nonsurvivors into low-antibody-titer ranges and more survivors (protected birds) into the high-antibody-titer ranges than the other plate antigens.", "PMC4840435": "Forty-one strains of Streptococcus mutans (34 from blood specimens from patients with endocarditis and 7 from stock cultures) were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, erythromycin, cephalothin, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. Minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined by a broth microdilution procedure. Most of the strains were very susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin, with most strains having minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.08 mug/ml or less. Most of the strains were also susceptible to cephalothin, methicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and vancomycin. Gentamicin was the most effective aminoglycoside. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are similar to those of other viridans streptococci. S. mutans strains have proven to be difficult for some microbiologists to identify. But when organisms suggesting S. mutans are isolated from patients with endocarditis, they should be at least identified as nonenterococcal streptococci so that appropriate therapy can be initiated.", "PMC3527612": "It has recently been reported that there is a significant loss of insulin immunoreactivity and bioavailability secondary to heat-induced insulin aggregation during prolonged insulin delivery by the Biostator.

This question was addressed in 30 men between 20 and 76 years of age who were known as a group to have experienced significant age-related loss of Leydig cells. If the loss of Leydig cells resulted from transformation into another cell type, other testicular interstitial cells in these men should have increased with age. Testes obtained at autopsy were perfused with glutaraldehyde less than 15 h after sudden death due to trauma or heart attack. Numbers of other interstitial cells were determined by quantitative histometric estimation of the proportion of testicular parenchyma occupied by other interstitial cell nuclei of measured average volume. Other interstitial cell nuclei declined significantly with advancing age (rho = -0.41, P less than 0.05). Mean number of other interstitial cell nuclei per individual was significantly reduced in the 15 men 50 yr old or older compared to the 15 younger men (460 +/- 34 million vs. 609 +/- 43 million; P less than 0.05). There was no tendency for individuals with reduced numbers of Leydig cells to have increased numbers of other interstitial cells. These findings argued against the persistence of Leydig cells in aged testes as dedifferentiated mesenchymal elements. Instead, light and electron microscopic observation of testes from these men revealed evidence of Leydig cell degeneration and dissolution.", "PMC3968076": "Isoprene formation in a rat liver cytosolic fraction is shown to be increased 146-fold by acid treatment. This acid catalysis is dependent upon prior incubation of the cytosolic fraction with DL-mevalonate and is stimulated when the incubation also contains ATP. Formation of isoprene proceeds linearly through 5 h of acid treatment and is nearly complete at 10 h. These results suggest that the acid-catalyzed isoprene formation arises from the decomposition of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate via a carbonium ion mechanism. Chemical model studies using 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol and 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol (the alcohols corresponding to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate, respectively) confirm this hypothesis. At a pH less than or equal to 1, an 85% decomposition of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol to isoprene occurred after 24 h, while 3% of 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol was converted to isoprene under identical conditions and time. It is concluded that the predominant immediate precursor of isoprene is dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and at low pH the ultimate fate of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate is complete conversion to isoprene. These conclusions have important biochemical and methodological implications.", "PMC3623848": "A canine model was used to determine the feasibility of preoperative, angiographic staining of bowel segments. Because methylene blue (MB) is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or unstable hemoglobins, two alternate dyes, isosulfan blue (lymphazurin) and fluorescein were also studied. These three dyes were injected into 27 different mesenteric arterial branches in seven dogs following transfemoral catheterization. The duration of staining was evaluated over periods ranging from hours to 14 days, and pathologic sections were obtained to detect possible toxic effects. MB staining adequate for surgical resection persisted consistently up to 6 hours. Isosulfan blue and fluorescein produced adequate staining for only 30 to 60 minutes. Toxic mucosal changes were noted in four of 12 segments harvested within hours of the injection of MB and in none of the five MB injected segments harvested at four of 14 days. These changes varied greatly from focal regions of superficial necrosis to more generalized regions of transmucosal necrosis. All of the segments injected with isosulfan blue or fluorescein were free of histologic damage. It is concluded that the duration of staining produced by MB is sufficiently long to allow injection at angiography rather than at surgery. This allows decreased catheter time, and more importantly, precludes the possibility of interval catheter displacement. However, its clinical use should be viewed with some caution until its safety is established by further investigation. Isosulfan blue and fluorescein appear as alternate injectables, particularly for patients in whom MB is contraindicated. Because of their relatively short staining durations, injections with these agents should be made during surgery after angiographic catheter placement, although this method risks interval catheter dislodgement.", "PMC3884787": "Infection by C. albicans is a significant cause of denture stomatitis. Therefore, the results of this study, which demonstrated that yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes removed C. albicans from acrylic resin surfaces, suggest that these compounds are potentially useful denture cleansers.", "PMC3428290": "Recently a novel and non-invasive technique of lower leg length measurement (knemometry) was introduced. The method estimates the distance between heel and knee in the sitting child with an accuracy of 0.09 mm(SD). Two female patients with anorexia nervosa, aged 14:4 and 13:7 years, weighing minus 27 and minus 38% of normal weight for age, were measured repeatedly with this method within periods of 72 and 129 days during hospitalization und up to 133 days thereafter. During the first 40 days of hospitalization, patient 1 was measured 30 times and showed significant shrinkage of the lower leg length of -0.040 mm/day (P less than 0.001). Over the remainder of her hospital stay her mean lower leg length increment still was much less (+0.036 mm/day) than that expected just by increase of soft tissue due to rapid weight gain (+0.126 kg/day). The second patient also showed significant shrinkage of lower leg length during a 4 month period after discharge from the hospital (-0.009 mm/day, P less than 0.01). This is the first demonstration of long term lower leg shrinkage in children. Its origin remains unclear, but this shrinkage is clearly distinct from either arbitrary changes of lower leg length due to errors of measurement or changes of body diameters due to temporary alterations of soft tissue (i.e. during periods of weight loss). We speculate that progressive atrophic changes of the epiphyseal plates still open in both patients may account for the observed long term shrinkage of lower leg length.", "PMC3677617": "1.

In the lumbar region and in the filum terminale, many cytoplasmatic protrusions are visible. They are irregular in size and shape and display many microvilli. They are extending into the lumen of the central canal. The basal parts of the ependymocytes occasionally have a very close association with the ependymal blood vessels. The pericapillary space, the pericapillary structures like pericytes and collagen fibrils, and the basal lamina are absent. Opposite branches of the ependymocytes growing together could be observed in the central canal, eventually forming a cytoplasmic unit. Cytoplasmatic extensions of the ependymocytes bridge the lumen of the central canal and melt into each another. Lacunae, such as described by LEONHARDT (1980) in the apical cytoplasm of the ependyma in the rabbit, do also exist in the ependyma coating the central canal of the spinal cord of the monkey Cercopithecus nigroviridis. Some of these lacunae have direct contact to the luminar surface of the central canal, others are separated. Cilia and short microvilli are coating the lacunae. Adjacent ependymal cells form complex interdigitations with each other. Close to their surface on the central canal, there are numerous zonulae adhaerentes.

Treatment with 20-80 mg omeprazole daily reduced basal acid secretion by 77-100%. The effect persisted during a continuous treatment of up to 2 years. In five patients the initial dose could be reduced after some time of treatment. In eight patients the treatment promptly relieved all symptoms, and in the last patient, who had disseminated metastatic disease and large anastomotic ulcers, the symptoms disappeared gradually over a period of 10 weeks. No adverse events were seen. We conclude that omeprazole is an effective inhibitor of the acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison patients, also when H2-receptor antagonists have failed.", "PMC3402463": "The 24-h ambulatory electrocardiograms of 15 patients with both variant angina and ischaemia-related arrhythmias were analyzed to correlate cardiac pain with the following variables: site, type, duration and magnitude of ECG changes, presence and type of arrhythmias and time of occurrence of ischaemic attacks during the 24-h. Apart from sublingual nitrate therapy, Holter monitoring was performed in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU), in the drug-free state in all patients. During a total of 79 days of monitoring, patients had 1385 ischaemic episodes, of which only 30% were painful. The site of ischaemia did not predict the occurrence of pain. Pain was more frequently associated with ST-segment elevation, longer ischaemic duration, increased time to peak ECG change, and greater ST-segment shift and arrhythmias. When the 259 attacks in association with ventricular arrhythmias were compared to the arrhythmia-free episodes, they were more frequently painful for the same duration and magnitude of ECG ischaemic changes. Furthermore, the complexity of arrhythmias increased the probability of cardiac pain. Most ischaemic episodes occurred at night and a decrease in the frequency of painful episodes (apart from those associated with arrhythmias) was apparent. Thus, in addition to electrocardiographic severity and duration of ischaemia, the presence of ventricular arrhythmias and the time of occurrence seem to influence pain perception during ischaemia.", "PMC2914742": "The safety of atrial pacemakers is still a remaining cause of controversy. Since 1972, we have implanted 111 atrial pacemakers and we were able to follow-up 100 patients continuously. Mean follow-up time was 47 +/- 36 months (maximum 154 months) with a total population time of 391 patient years. Over a period of 10 years, the cumulative incidence of complete atrioventricular block was 4% (2 patients). The cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation was 11% (5 patients). Lead-related complications were strongly dependent on the type of the lead and the mode of fixation. The cumulative incidence of all lead-related problems was 19% over a period of 5 years and 33% over a period of 10 years. The cumulative survival rate was 85% for 5 years and 61% for 10 years. These survival rates were not different from the survival rate of a matched cohort of the normal population. We conclude that atrial pacing could be done in patients with sick sinus syndrome. The risk of developing a complete atrioventricular block seems to be rather low. The main problem of the atrial pacemaker is the fixation of the lead which could be reduced by using screw-in-type leads.", "PMC1351271": "In the companion report [Nisenbaum and Berger (1992) Neuroscience 48, 561-578] the contrasting paired impulse responses to stimulation of the corticostriatal pathway which define the Type I and Type II subpopulations of striatal neurons were shown to reflect differential regulation by GABAergic and dopaminergic inputs. More specifically, the decreased probability of spike discharge (inhibition) to long interstimulus intervals (60-260 ms) characteristic of Type I neurons was found to be dependent on dopaminergic input via D1 receptor activation, whereas the inhibition to short interstimulus intervals (10-20 ms) distinctive of Type II neurons was found to be mediated by GABAergic input acting through GABAA receptor stimulation. The present experiments have further investigated the contribution of GABAergic and dopaminergic feedforward and/or feedback circuits to the functional identities of Type I and Type II neurons using an in vitro corticostriatal slice preparation. In this preparation, the cortical afferents to the striatum are preserved, allowing for activation of striatal cells in a manner similar to that used in vivo; however, all axons arising from midbrain and brainstem structures including the substantia nigra are transected, and intrastriatal GABAergic pathways are reduced. Consistent with the predicted effect of disrupting these two neurotransmitter pathways, the paired impulse responses of striatal neurons recorded in vitro were not similar to the responses of either Type I or Type II neurons recorded in vivo. Indeed, the paired impulse profiles of striatal neurons recorded in vitro were relatively homogeneous in that virtually all cells displayed an increased probability of spike discharge (facilitation) to the second impulse of all interstimulus intervals (10-500ms) tested. Low concentrations of allosteric agonists for the GABAA receptor, pregnanolone (5 microM) and pentobarbital (50 microM), selectively inhibited spike discharge in response to short interstimulus intervals (10-20 ms) for approximately 40% of the neurons sampled, but produced no change in facilitation to longer interstimulus intervals (30-500 ms). The agonist-induced inhibition to short interstimulus intervals was blocked by bicuculline (10-20 microM), and was not mimicked by the GABAB receptor agonist, baclofen (1-5 microM). In addition, application of dopamine (5-10 microM) or the D1 receptor agonist, SKF38393 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine; 5 microM), inhibited spike discharge to longer interstimulus intervals (40-500 ms) for approximately 10% of striatal cells recorded. The inhibition to longer interstimulus intervals was blocked by the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390 [R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepin+ ++-7-ol], but not the D2 antagonist, sulpiride.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC2711228": "In most countries of the third world, strategies for development in the health sector include efforts to upgrade the skills of village level health care workers, including traditional birth attendants (TBAs).

Drawing on data from several years of ethnographic fieldwork with Maya midwives in Yucatan and on participation in government-sponsored training courses for indigenous midwives, this paper examines some of the reasons underlying this failure.

The macrophage hybridomas were further screened for the capacity to acquire tumoricidal activity upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) using murine mammary adenocarcinoma MM48 cells as targets, and three macrophage hybridoma clones, KM-1, KM-2, and KM-3, were established. With concomitant stimulation with LPS, IFN-gamma activated these hybridomas dose dependently to exhibit high tumoricidal activity, whereas single stimulation with either INF-gamma or LPS, even with higher concentrations, did not activate the macrophage hybridomas. This contrasted with the activation of glycogen-PEC for eliciting tumoricidal activity with a single stimulation with LPS (greater than 1 ng/ml) or IFN-gamma (greater than 10 IU/ml). Thus, the macrophage hybridoma clones established here represent inflammatory macrophages which require both IFN-gamma and LPS for their activation.", "PMC4018078": "Biosynthesis of N-acetylcysteine S-conjugates of xenobiotics (mercapturic acids) occurs via interorgan metabolism and the renal transtubular transport system plays an important role in elimination of the final metabolites from the organism. To assess the behavior of a mercapturic acid in the circulation, plasma clearance of radioactive S-benzyl-N-acetylcysteine and its interaction with plasma proteins were studied in normal and mutant analbuminemic rats (NAR). Intravenously injected S-benzyl-N-acetylcysteine rapidly disappeared from the circulation both in NAR and normal animals. However, its plasma clearance was significantly higher in NAR (45.7 ml kg-1 min-1) than in normal rats (25.2 ml kg-1 min-1). Ultrafiltration analysis revealed that 18.4% and 80.1% of the mercapturate bound to plasma protein(s) from NAR and normal rats, respectively, at 50 microM ligand concentration. The mercapturic acid bound to plasma albumin with an association constant of 2.24 X 10(5) M-1 and the number of binding sites was 1.18/mol albumin. The binding was competitively inhibited by probenecid and L-tryptophan. Concomitant administration of this mercapturic acid with equimolar amounts of albumin resulted in a marked decrease in the plasma clearance (26.2 ml kg-1 min-1) and an increase in the urinary secretion of this ligand in NAR. 30 min after injection of the mercapturic acid (10 mumol/kg body weight), 27.3% and 60.4% of the injected dose was recovered from urine and kidneys of NAR and normal rats respectively. About 41% of the dose was recovered in NAR urine when the ligand was injected bound to an equimolar amount of albumin. These results suggested that albumin is important for the renal accumulation and urinary elimination of the circulating mercapturic acid.", "PMC3561949": "Tapetoretinal degeneration is not infrequently associated with other systemic abnormalities.

Pretreatment with pyrilamine (0.1 mg/kg i.v. bolus injection) did not reduce the increase in microvascular permeability produced by any dose of histamine. In contrast, cimetidine (0.5 mg/kg/min i.v. infusion) significantly inhibited the microvascular permeability responses to 10 and 100 micrograms histamine. Although neither cimetidine nor pyrilamine significantly altered the microvascular permeability response to 0.1 and 1 micrograms histamine, inhibition was afforded by a cimetidine-pyrilamine combination. These results suggest a predominantly H2-receptor mediated phenomenon with a minor H1-receptor mediated component. Studies with the H2-receptor agonists impromidine and dimaprit and the H1-receptor agonist beta-histine provide further support for this contention. Dimaprit and impromidine caused a dose-dependent increase in cutaneous microvascular permeability, but betahistine produced only a relatively modest response. In other laboratory species, increased cutaneous microvascular permeability appears to be mediated solely by H1-receptors. Therefore, the hamster skin appears unique with respect to the pronounced H2-receptor involvement in histamine-induced microvascular permeability changes.", "PMC4050303": "Four about 4-week-old puppies were fixed by perfusion; the secretory ameloblasts of the first molar tooth germs were observed with an electron microscope.

In view of a recent interesting hypothesis that the vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the maintenance of hypertension, we examined the effect of delapril (DP), a newly developed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), on angiotensin II (Ang II) release from isolated perfused hind legs of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in comparison with normotensive rats of Wistar-Kyoto strain (WKY). 2. Male SHR and WKY were given DP orally (10 mg/kg per day) for 2 weeks. Isolated hind legs of these rats were perfused with angiotensinogen-free Krebs-Ringer solution, and Ang II released into the perfusate was determined directly by extraction with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges connected to the perfusion system. 3. Delapril produced a sustained antihypertensive action in SHR but not in WKY. The spontaneous release of Ang II in SHR was 112.9 +/- 17.6 pg during the first 30 min of perfusion, which was somewhat greater than that in WKY (96.5 +/- 9.8 pg). An active metabolite of DP, delapril diacid (DPD), when added to the perfusion medium, suppressed the Ang II release in a dose-dependent manner in the two strains. Oral pretreatment of DP for 2 weeks suppressed the Ang II release by 60% in WKY and more pronouncedly by 73% in SHR. 4. These results suggest the presence of a functional RAS in vascular tissues which contributes to the maintenance of vascular tone of SHR, and that ACEI including DP exerts their antihypertensive effect through inhibition of vascular Ang II release in this animal model of human hypertension.", "PMC3203221": "A woman with renal colic and microscopic hematuria had filling defects in the left renal collecting system detected on excretory urography.

The history may indicate admission for AMI exclusion or unstable angina, although these data remain largely subjective. The physical examination provides few clues in subtle presentations of myocardial cell death, and instead identifies patients with left ventricular dysfunction, often with failure. The 12-lead ECG is an insensitive early indicator of AMI, often identifying 50% or fewer of these patients. Currently, thrombolytic therapy or invasive catheterization techniques such as PTCA are based on 12-lead depictions of acute injury patterns.

Human metanephric explants from foetuses 10-18 weeks of gestational age were cultured in serum-free Leibovitz L-15 medium without hormones. Under the current minimal conditions for growth, the system permitted to maintain the renal tissues in culture for periods up to 9 days, although no evident sign of morphological differentiation was observed. However, during the studied period the overall architecture of the explants was preserved as well as the ultrastructural features of cytoplasmic organelles. The incorporation of 3H-thymidine and 3H-leucine indicated that DNA and protein synthesis was maintained or increased. Glycoprotein synthesis evaluated by 3H-glucosamine incorporation and radioautography continued in mesangium as well as in glomerular and tubular basement membranes.

Malonyldialdehyde, produced in vivo (endogenous malonyldialdehyde) or following in vitro exposure of cells to 10 mM H2O2 (H2O2 malonyldialdehyde), was used as a measure of peroxidant stress. After 5 weeks, the plasma cholesterol concentrations in rats receiving 1.2% cholesterol + 0.6% cholic acid in their diet rose to 6-times that of control rats receiving a diet without added cholesterol; at the same time, erythrocyte H2O2 malonyldialdehyde in the cholesterol-fed rats decreased significantly relative to the control rats. During subsequent exposure of both groups to in vivo peroxidant stress with phenylhydrazine in two separate dose trials, erythrocyte peroxidant stress remained significantly lower in the cholesterol-fed rats: at a dose of 100 mumol/100 g body weight, H2O2 malonyldialdehyde was lower; at a dose of 25 mumol/100 g body weight, both endogenous and H2O2 malonyldialdehyde were lower. Erythrocyte membrane cholesterol concentrations were 12% higher in the cholesterol-fed rats than in controls. The effects of in vivo peroxidant stress on plasma cholesterol were also studied. In vivo peroxidant stress at the higher dose of phenylhydrazine produced a decrease in plasma cholesterol concentrations of control rats. The lower dose had no effect on this group and the plasma cholesterol concentrations were unchanged in the cholesterol-fed rats during both treatments. The data suggest that elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations are protective against erythrocyte peroxidant stress. The mechanism of cholesterol's protective effect is probably mediated through elevated membrane cholesterol concentrations.", "PMC3491847": "Authors report on a rare case of thyroid involvement by histiocytosis X.

For the experimental group, adult labeling occurred when the children expressed interest in the toy. Control group children were yoked temporally to experimental group children for the purpose of adult labeling. Thus, adult labeling for the control group was randomly related to the children's expressions of interest. Although both groups of children learned some Spanish words, children in the experimental group produced significantly more Spanish words during the training sessions and showed superior performance on posttraining tests of Spanish production. Levels of comprehension of the Spanish words were equivalent for both groups.

[N-35S]Heparin is the most commonly used substrate for the assay of sulfamidase activity but has certain disadvantages which have prompted us to search for alternative substrates. We report here on the use of heparin oligosaccharides for this purpose. The trisaccharide, GlcN-IdoUA-GlcN, and the pentasaccharide, GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN, were N-sulfated with [35S]sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex; the tetrasaccharide, GlcN-UA-GlcN-UA, and the pentasaccharide, GlcN-IdoUA-GlcN-IdoUA-GlcN, were labeled by reduction with sodium borotritide followed by chemical N-sulfation. When incubated with sonicates of cultured skin fibroblasts from normal individuals, all four oligosaccharides were found to serve as substrates for heparin sulfamidase. Fibroblast sonicates from patients with the Sanfilippo A syndrome had little or no activity toward these substrates. Optimal activity of the enzyme was at pH 4.4-4.5. Comparison of the kinetic parameters showed that heparin had a lower Km than the oligosaccharides, whereas the Vmax values of the latter were higher than for heparin.", "PMC4009323": "Primary pancreatic carcinomas were studied histologically and histochemically, to assess the frequency of ductal hyperplasia in tissue adjacent to malignant neoplasms. Hyperplasia was divided into four types: simple, papillary, atypical and ductular, affecting large, medium and small ducts (ductules). All types of hyperplasia were frequently seen in areas adjacent to carcinomas, including ductal, pleomorphic, mucinous, adenosquamous, small and spindle cell and cystadenocarcinomas. In contrast, acinar cell carcinoma and microadenocarcinoma were less frequently associated with ductal hyperplasia. Mucin histochemistry revealed differences in types of mucin between the normal ducts and hyperplastic pancreatic ducts and carcinomas. The former group contained small amounts of sulphated mucin while the latter showed a marked increase in neutral and sialomucins. Our study also suggests that both papillary and atypical hyperplasia are precancerous lesions, supporting an hypothesis of ductal origin of pancreatic carcinomas.", "PMC3540692": "Plasma fibronectin (FN) concentration was measured in patients with idiopathic glomerulonephritis (GN) with or without impaired renal function, in uremic patients undergoing periodic hemodialysis and in renal transplant patients before and after an acute rejection crisis. Results show normal FN levels in idiopathic GN and in renal transplant patients with normal renal function, while significantly lower levels were found in GN with severe renal damage, in uremia before and after dialysis, and in renal transplant patients during acute and chronic graft rejection. Significant correlations between high serum creatinine values and low plasma FN levels were found in renal transplant patients. These findings suggest that the kidney may influence FN levels in the blood since acute (rejection crisis) and chronic renal failure (uremia) cause low concentrations of this protein, while levels tend to return to normal values in patients with uremia after renal transplantation. We hypothesize that the normal kidney removes or perhaps degrades some substances or hormones that may control the release or synthesis of FN. These substances are not dialyzed by cellophane membranes since low plasma FN levels persist after periodic hemodialysis. Only the renal graft provokes an increase of FN in the blood stream.", "PMC3320645": "IgE-associated cells in the specimens of 25 allergic and non-allergic subjects were stained by the peroxidase technique with the use of a polyclonal antiserum. The technique is described and its advantages over the immunofluorescence procedures are shown. In each allergic subject IgE-associated cells could be stained, whereas no cells could be found in non-atopic subjects after suppressing non-specific background staining (Fig. 4). Therefore, this method allows to distinguish between IgE-mediated allergic diseases of the nasal mucosa and diseases of other pathomechanisms. The stained cells formed a specific distribution pattern with a typical accumulation in the subepithelial and epithelial layer (Fig. 2), whereas only few cells were found in the mucosal glands.", "PMC3521232": "A simplified technique of harvesting of the ear cartilage graft is described which (1) uses a postauricular incision to minimize the visible scars, (2) removes the whole floor of the conchal fossa to avoid the irregularities, and (3) uses a tie-over dressing to eliminate the need for a head dressing. This technique has been used on 88 patients with one visible and tender medial irregularity, and three minor palpable, but invisible irregularities.", "PMC4037201": "Sixty-eight patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas had an estimated 5 year survival rate of 34 percent after initial treatment.

The respective survival rates for patients with partial excision were 33 percent and 0 and for those with only a biopsy the survival rates at 5 and 7 years were 10 percent. Radiotherapy with chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone was given to 47 patients. In the treatment of macroscopic tumor, radiotherapy or radiotherapy plus chemotherapy resulted in a 5 year survival rate of 10 percent and chemotherapy alone in a 5 year survival rate of 8 percent.

Isolates were inoculated into a defined medium and incubated aerobically for 1 h at 35 degrees C. The organisms were removed, and the supernatants were derivatized for 1 min at room temperature by the addition of o-phthalaldehyde. The total time required to run each chromatogram was approximately 50 min. Standardized peak heights for each medium component and any new peaks formed were calculated for each isolate and compared with those for uninoculated control medium. Multiple isolates of various Clostridium species gave consistent patterns of medium utilization that could be used for identification.

Bright light had a marked antidepressant effect, whereas the dim light did not. This response could not be attributed to sleep deprivation. Subsequent pilot studies indicated that bright evening light alone is probably also effective. Several patients were able to maintain the antidepressant response throughout the winter months by continuing daily light treatments.", "PMC3617199": "A survey of a community in northeast Thailand where Opisthorchis viverrini is endemic permitted comparison of two methods of measuring incidence: direct determination of the rate at which an uninfected group became infected between two surveys a year apart, and estimation of incidence from age-specific prevalence data using a logarithmic regression method. Both methods revealed that incidence increased with age in young children, and estimation from age-prevalence data showed that the increase was roughly linear from near birth to about age 5 years, beyond which no clear trend in incidence was evident. A catalytic infection model incorporating an infection rate increasing from birth to age 5, and remaining constant thereafter, gave an excellent fit to age-prevalence profiles. Both methods of determining incidence are sensitive to errors in diagnosis, but the direct determination method is more sensitive to the presence of false negatives. A method for correcting this bias is given. The regression method, which was less sensitive to yearly variation in incidence and is easier to use, is recommended for preliminary surveys to identify villages with high transmission intensity.", "PMC3546078": "A mentally retarded male was found to be homozygous for a paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 12(inv(12)(q21.1q23.2].

Three cancer cell lines from the stomach and one from the colon were transplanted into nude mice to establish a standard assay method for selection of effective drugs on individual tumors using the criteria of the Japanese Association of Sensitivity Determination for Carcinostatic Agents. From the LD values of anticancer drugs in nude mice, the appropriate doses of drugs were 6 mg/kg of MMC X 1(i.p.), 50 mg/kg of 5-FU q4d X 3 (i.p.), 120 mg/kg of CPA (i.p.), 30 mg/kg of ACNU (i.p.) 8 mg/kg of CDDP (i.p.) and 8 mg/kg of ADM (i.v.). At 3 weeks after initial treatment, the inhibition rate (IR) of the tumor was calculated from the formula IR = (1-T/C) X 100%, where T is the mean tumor weight of the treated group and C is the mean weight of the untreated group at that time. The tumors respond well to the anticancer agents when IR is more than 58%.", "PMC3598906": "Hypertension due to pheochromocytoma is generally considered to be a straightforward, direct consequence of the elevated concentrations of circulating catecholamines. However, clonidine, a centrally acting antihypertensive drug, has been reported to lower blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma, suggesting the possibility that the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the maintenance of hypertension in this disease. We have investigated this possibility in New England Deaconess Hospital rats harboring a transplantable pheochromocytoma that secretes norepinephrine and dopamine. Both clonidine and chlorisondamine, a ganglionic blocker, markedly decreased blood pressure in tumor-bearing rats. However, in other rats made acutely hypertensive with a norepinephrine infusion, neither clonidine nor chlorisondamine decreased blood pressure. This result indicates that in an acute model of hypertension, where baroreflex mechanisms have likely withdrawn sympathetic tone, neither clonidine nor chlorisondamine had nonspecific antihypertensive effects. A central nervous system site of action for the antihypertensive effect of clonidine in the rats harboring pheochromocytoma was suggested by the observation that the opiate antagonist naloxone both reversed and prevented clonidine's effect on blood pressure. Prazosin and yohimbine were utilized to determine the respective contributions of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the maintenance of hypertension in rats harboring pheochromocytoma. Both drugs markedly lowered blood pressure in these rats. Our data suggest that both the sympathetic nervous system and circulating catecholamines are involved in the maintenance of hypertension due to pheochromocytoma.", "PMC2245900": "Doppler echocardiography is a potentially useful tool for the non invasive evaluation of cardiac output and, therefore, for the quantitative assessment of valvular regurgitation. The aim of our study was to establish the presence of possible pitfalls in the evaluation of mitral and aortic regurgitant fraction obtained by Doppler echocardiography comparing the cardiac output measured at the level of the mitral and aortic valve. For this purpose 19 healthy volunteers, aged between 14-68 years, were studied. Stroke volume and cardiac output were calculated at the level of the mitral and aortic valve. The methods we used for the measurement of both the mitral and aortic cardiac output had already been validated and presumes that the shape of the valve annulus, is circular. No statistically significant differences were found between the parameters obtained at the two different valvular levels. Furthermore, cardiac output values correlated fairly well (r = 0.83, ESS = 0.78 l/min). In 9 subjects the aortic cardiac output was greater than the mitral one, while in the others mitral cardiac output was greater. The average of the differences between the two cardiac outputs was 0.58 +/- 0.48 l/min with a regurgitation fraction of 9.5 +/- 7.9%. Our results show that the mitral and aortic stroke volume and cardiac output, as measured by Doppler echocardiography (considering a circular shaped valve annulus, are not statistically different and correlate fairly well in our normal subjects. Nevertheless, we observed a certain degree of variability between the mitral and the aortic cardiac output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3807708": "Clonogenic cells of some normal tissues (CFU-GM of the bone marrow of mice, CFU-F of the bone marrow of rats, CFU-GM and CFU-F of the bone marrow of dormice) as well as tumor clonogenic cells of the ascitic variant of ascitic Ehrlich carcinoma were characterized by similar thermosensitivity during their heating under in vitro conditions whereas thermosensitivity in clonogenic cells of solid tumors (LLC, solid Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma) turned out twice as high. A possibility of inducing thermotolerance in these cells by various modes was shown.", "PMC2790901": "A twelve-day reducing regime involving exercise and a reducing diet (2.5 MJ/day), led in 23 obese women to an average loss of body weight of 4.52 +/- 0.35 kg. The loss of adipose tissue during the reducing regime was greater than the total loss of body weight, obviously due to proliferation of lean body mass as a result of exercise. Concurrently a significant decline of the mean morning concentration of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, C-peptide and STH in serum was recorded, while the concentration of TSH, cortisol, prolactin, LH and FSH increased insignificantly and the concentration of insulin and testosterone declined insignificantly. Exercise thus did not prevent a decline of triiodothyronine induced by the low energy diet. The exercise in the morning did not cause a stress conditioned increase of the secretion of cortisol, prolactin and STH at the onset and at the end of the reducing regime. From the metabolic aspect the favourable absence of the stimulating action of exercise on cortisol secretion is due to the character of motor activity (40-50% VO2max). The absence of a stress conditioned rise of prolactin during exercise prevents the inhibiting action of prolactin on gonadal functions. The reducing regime has also a favourable effect on insulin secretion, as on the 12th day of the reducing regime there was a significant decline of the serum level of immunoreactive insulin in the course of exercise.", "PMC3763781": "A retrospective case not analysis for 30 boys diagnosed as having a 'schizoid' personality disorder (Asperger's syndrome) in childhood, and for 30 matched clinic attenders (with systematic follow-up data for 19 matched pairs), showed the incidence of antisocial conduct to be the same in the two groups. However, the 'schizoid' boys stole less often and had fewer alcohol problems. In this group antisocial conduct was less related to family disruption and social disadvantage, and more to an unusual fantasy life. Clinical descriptions of a series of 'schizoid' boys and girls with conspicuous antisocial conduct follow. They suggest that characteristic patterns of antisocial conduct in such children are persistent expressions of hostility and, especially in girls, pathological lying, for which environmental circumstances provide no explanation.", "PMC3593219": "Phenylephrine, vasopressin and glucagon each increased the amount of active (dephospho) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) in isolated rat hepatocytes. Treatment with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) opposed the increase in PDHa caused by both phenylephrine and glucagon, but had no effect on the response to vasopressin: PMA alone had no effect on PDHa. As PMA is known to prevent the phenylephrine-induced increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) and to diminish the increase [Ca2+]c caused by glucagon, while having no effect on the ability of vasopressin to increase [Ca2+]c, these data are consistent with the notion that in intact cells an increase in [Ca2+]c results in an increase in the mitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration, which in turn leads to the activation of PDH. In the presence of 2.5 mM-Ca2+, glucagon caused an increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence in hepatocytes. This increase is taken to reflect an enhanced activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases. PMA alone had no effect on NAD(P)H fluorescence; it did, however, compromise the increase produced by glucagon. When the extracellular free [Ca2+] was decreased to 0.2 microM, glucagon could still increase NAD(P)H fluorescence. Vasopressin also increased fluorescence under these conditions; however, if vasopressin was added after glucagon, no further increase in fluorescence was observed. Treatment of the cells with PMA resulted in a smaller increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence on addition of glucagon: the subsequent addition of vasopressin now caused a further increase in fluorescence. Changes in [Ca2+]c corresponding to the changes in NAD(P)H fluorescence were observed, again supporting the idea that [Ca2+]c indirectly regulates intramitochondrial dehydrogenase activity in intact cells. PMA alone had no effect on pyruvate kinase activity, and the phorbol ester did not prevent the inactivation caused by glucagon. The latter emphasizes the different mechanisms by which the hormone influences mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metabolism.", "PMC2175325": "Endothelial cell incubated with IL-1 have been shown adhere more lymphocytes than nontreated endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-1 can also increase lymphocyte penetration through endothelial monolayers in vitro. IL-1 induced a transient increase in the number of lymphocytes penetrated through the endothelial monolayer into a filter in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect could be mimicked by increasing the cytosolic cAMP levels in the endothelial cells either by forskolin or dibutyryl-cAMP. Concomitantly we were able to show that IL-1 increased the cytosolic cAMP levels in endothelial cells. An inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, ddAdo, decreased both the IL-1-induced cAMP elevation and lymphocyte penetration. A protein kinase A inhibitor HA 1004 could inhibit the IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration, where as protein kinase C (N-(2-guamidino-ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesyl foamide hydrocloride) and calcium-calmodulin (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalensulfanamide) inhibitors had no effect. Adding dibutyryl-cGMP or calcium ionophore to the endothelial cells could not mimic IL-1-induced penetration and finally IL-1 did not induce PKC translocation in endothelial cells. These data support the view that IL-1 acts via cAMP as a second messenger in regard to lymphocyte penetration through endothelial cells. The above data demonstrate that IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration through endothelial cells and that this IL-1-induced signal is transduced via cAMP in endothelial cells.", "PMC3605090": "Renal fluoride toxicity in human beings is difficult to assess in the literature. Although experimental studies and research on methoxyflurane toxicity have shown frank renal damage, observations of renal insufficiency related to chronic fluoride exposure are scarce.

Features of fluoride osteosclerosis were prominent and end-stage renal failure was present. The young age of the patient, the long duration of high fluoride intake, and the absence of other cause of renal insufficiency suggest a causal relationship between fluoride intoxication and renal failure.", "PMC3901001": "Protein extracts from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been fractionated to reveal a nuclease activity that cleaves cruciform structures in DNA.

Between 1980-1987 vesicostomy was performed in 16 such patients (11 female, 5 male). Eleven had myelomeningocoele, 4 sacral anomalies and one cerebral palsy with scoliosis. All patients had urinary tract infections and deteriorating hydronephrosis and hydroureter (IVP, U/S); associated reflux in 13, impaired GFR in 4 and abnormal biochemistry in 8. The mean age at surgery was 3.3 years (8 mths. to 9 years). In all cases deterioration was arrested by vesicostomy. Fifteen patients showed structural or functional improvement and one stabilized. Late closure of the vesicostomy in two cases resulted in disimprovement of biochemical and radiological parameters. Acceptance of the vesicostomies was good. We advocate vesicostomy as an effective drainage procedure to preserve function in patients with neuropathic bladders and deteriorating renal tracts, in whom intermittent self catheterization is not a realistic alternative.", "PMC4086518": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the surface features of purified large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) (natural killer (NK) cells, antibody-dependent cytotoxic lymphoid (ADCL) cells, K-cells, Fc gamma (+) third population (non-T, non-B) lymphoid cells, T gamma cells) by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and to compare their surface features with granulocytes, monocytes and Fc gamma (-) lymphoid cells that were all fixed for SEM under identical conditions. We have determined that 72-80% of LGLs enriched by rosette formation with sensitized erythrocytes or using Percoll gradients, have a complex microvillous surface (CMS) pattern identical to that of lymphocytes. The LGL fraction appears by SEM to represent a morphologically homogeneous population of cells. Monocytes prepared for SEM under identical conditions had distinct surface folds and granulocytes displayed numerous broad-based ridge-like profiles. The majority of lymphoid cells in an unfractioned population have a CMS pattern when incubated at room temperature (25 degrees C) before fixation, and a sparse microvillous surface (SMS) pattern when incubated at body temperature (37 degrees C). Ficoll-Hypaque (FH) also had a direct effect on the cell surface pattern. Over half of the unfractionated lymphoid cells displayed a CMS pattern after cells were washed free of FH and incubated at 37 degrees C before fixation. The CMS pattern is therefore not unique to LGLs but can be produced by the surface alteration of non-LGLs found in unfractionated buffy coat and mononuclear fractions. The interactions between LGLs and sensitized erythrocytes in an antibody-dependent cytotoxic assay system, and LGLs and K562 target cells in an NK assay system, were also examined. This is the first report that describes the surface features of human LGLs interacting with K562 target cells in an NK assay system. The LGL populations studied by SEM were determined to have a high percentage of Leu-11(+) and Leu-7(+) cells. These same population were also shown to have high antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and NK activity using the 51Cr release assay.", "PMC3207888": "The number and intensity of fluorescence of small, intensely fluorescent cells were measured on serial slices of main pelvic (MPG) ganglion and lumbar ganglia of sympathetic trunk (LG), treated by modified Falck method, on days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 26-30 months of age.

The operons of the glp system show different patterns of response to each control. By growing in parallel a mutant strain with temperature-sensitive repressor (glpR(ts)) and an isogenic control with a deletion in the regulator gene at progressively higher temperatures, it was possible to show that the synthesis of aerobic G3P dehydrogenase (glpD product) is far more sensitive to specific repression than that of either glycerol kinase (glpK product) or G3P transport (glpT product). Conversely, in the strain with a deletion in the regulator gene, the syntheses of glycerol kinase and G3P transport are more sensitive to catabolite repression than that of the aerobic G3P dehydrogenase. The levels of the two flavoprotein G3P dehydrogenases vary in opposite directions in response to changes of exogenous hydrogen acceptors. For example, the ratio of the aerobic enzyme to the anaerobic enzyme (specified by glpA) is high when molecular oxygen or nitrate serves as the hydrogen acceptor and low when fumarate plays this role. This trend is not influenced by the addition of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate to the growth medium. Thus, respiratory repression most likely involves a third mechanism of control, independent of specific or catabolite repression.", "PMC2940119": "Atrial tissue extract (AE) and ventricular tissue extract cause identical decreases in total peripheral resistance when they are injected i.v. into anesthetized rats. However, only AE causes significant hypotension because of cardiac inhibition. This involves both bradycardia and failure of stroke volume to increase appropriately. The observations cannot be explained by direct action of AE on myocytes, but are more likely to be the result of interactions with cardiovascular reflex mechanisms. Excitation of chemosensitive cardiac receptors with vagal afferents appears to be an important afferent mechanism. The efferent limb for the negative chronotropic response resides partly in the vagus nerves and partly in cardiac sympathetic nerves. The negative inotropic response of AE was not altered by vagotomy, spinal section, atropine, or propranolol. These results suggest that atrial peptides may cause the release of a negatively inotropic substance from a site that is not yet identified.", "PMC3999033": "1,2-Dichloroethane produces kidney damage, but the mechanism is unclear. Cysteine conjugates, which could arise from S-(2-chloroethyl)glutathione or S-(2-chloroethyl)cysteine have been identified. In this study, rats given S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine (100 mg/kg i.p.) showed significant increases in blood urea nitrogen and urine glucose concentrations. Histopathological examination of kidneys, 36 hr after treatment showed acute proximal tubular nephrosis and punctuate glomerular necrosis. No hepatic lesions were seen and serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities were only elevated slightly. The extent of S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine renal toxicity was dose- and time-dependent. Equimolar doses of analogs of S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine, S-ethyl-L-cysteine, S-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-acetyl-DL-cysteine, S-(2-hydroxyethyl)-DL-cysteine, or S-(3-chloropropyl)-DL-cysteine, failed to produce nephrotoxicity; rats given L-cysteine (100 mg/kg i.p.), S-ethyl-L-cysteine (100 mg/kg i.p.) or probenecid (60 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before receiving S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine had significant reductions of the S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine-induced blood urea nitrogen and urine glucose elevations. These results show that S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine is a potent, selective nephrotoxin that may be responsible for the renal damage associated with 1,2-dichloroethane. The formation of an episulfonium ion plays an important role in S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine-induced nephrotoxicity. The protection against renal damage provided by S-ethyl-L-cysteine or probenecid may involve competition with S-(2-chloroethyl)-DL-cysteine for cellular or transport binding sites.", "PMC3558204": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic exercise training is associated with increased vascular flow capacity and capillary exchange capacity in skeletal muscles. One group of male Sprague-Dawley rats was cage confined for a period of 13-17 wk (sedentary control, C) and a second was trained for 1 h/day at a speed of 30 m/min up a 5 degrees incline for 13-17 wk (exercise trained, ET). Studies were conducted with maximally dilated (papaverine) isolated hindquarters of 13 C rats and 10 ET rats perfused with Tyrode's solution containing 5% albumin. Vascular flow capacity was estimated by measuring total and regional flows at three to five different perfusion pressures. Capillary exchange capacity was estimated by measuring maximal capillary filtration coefficients and capillary diffusion capacity for 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA). The efficacy of the training was shown by significant increases in succinate dehydrogenase activities of the vastus intermedius muscle. Total hindquarter flow capacity was 50% higher in the ET rats. Regional flow data indicated that the higher total flow was due to increased muscle flow (85%), with the high-oxidative muscle tissue having the greatest increases (e.g., 200% increase in red gastrocnemius muscle). The maximal capillary diffusion capacity values for the ET rats were 70% greater than control values. However, the capillary filtration capacity values of the C and ET rats were not different. We conclude that the vascular transport capacity of the high-oxidative areas of extensor muscles is increased by endurance training.", "PMC3698207": "O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was measured in partially synchronized cultures of C3H/10T1/2 mouse embryo cells as a function of cell cycle. The degree of synchrony and progression of the cell cycle were monitored by flow cytometry. The MGMT level was significantly reduced prior to the onset of S-phase. This reduction was concomitant with the inhibition of in vivo repair of O6-methylguanine in DNA of S-phase cells as observed earlier. The recovery of the MGMT level paralleled the progression of synchronized cells into G2. S-phase cells purified by cell sorting contained approximately 15% of the MGMT present in G0 or early G1 cells. A comparison of the in vivo repair of O6-methylguanine and MGMT levels suggests that the lack of repair of O6-methylguanine in DNA of the mouse embryo cells is due only in part to a temporal loss of MGMT.", "PMC3917691": "Structures of anionic oligosaccharides released by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H from human thyroglobulin (19 S) purified from normal and malignant (papillary carcinoma) thyroid tissues were studied by sequential exoglycosidase digestion and lectin affinity chromatography.

Examination of the pleural fluid is the only way to differentiate empyema and complicated parapneumonic effusions from uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions, and this differentiation is vital in deciding whether chest tube drainage is needed. If the aspirated pleural fluid contains pus or bacteria, closed chest tube drainage and antibiotic therapy should be started promptly. The same management approach is indicated if the pleural fluid pH is less than 7.00 or the glucose level is less than 40 mg/ml, since these effusions almost invariably are complicated parapneumonic effusions that do not resolve without fluid drainage. If the pleural fluid pH is greater than 7.20 and glucose level is more than 40 mg/ml, antibiotic therapy alone will suffice.

A highly purified exopolysaccharide preparation bound up to 253 nmol of Cu per mg of carbohydrate. The conditional stability constant for the crude exopolymer-Cu complex was 7.3 X 10(8). This value was similar to those obtained for Cu complexes formed with humic acids and xanthan, an exopolysaccharide produced by Xanthomonas campestris.

Although tissue-destructive neutrophil-derived proteinases may play a supportive role in acute pulmonary injury, it appears that oxygen radical constitute the major neutrophil product responsible for acute damage of lung tissues and cells. Intravascular activation of neutrophils by the chemotactic complement peptide C5a is related to the generation of superoxide anion.

Clinicopsychological study (neurological, endocrinological investigation, Cattell, Levine-Hoppe and MMIL testing) was performed in 23 women with exhaustion syndrome. The patients were divided into 2 groups: (1), 12 patients with bulimic neurogenic anorexia; (2), 11 neurotic patients with genuine anorexia. All patients displayed the background dysfunction of the cerebral integrative systems with motivational, neuro-metabolic-endocrine and autonomic disorders. Constitutional acquired hypothalamo-hypophyseal insufficiency had special traits in either group, a factor substantially influencing the course of the disease. The fact that neurogenic anorexia combined with hypothalamo-hypophyseal insufficiency was crucial for the establishment of bulimic form in particular, and for increased incidence of neuro-metabolic-endocrine disorders. Contrarily, the exhaustion syndrome in neuroses developing on the background of hypothalamo-hypophyseal insufficiency was influenced by the decompensation of initial motivational (anorexia) and neuro-metabolic (asthenic constitution) signs.

The assay involves deproteinization of plasma, overnight Glusulase incubation to hydrolyze the major metabolite (I-B-glucuronide), extraction of the parent compound and its deconjugated metabolites (I-A, I-B and I-C) from the alkalinized aqueous phase into diethyl ether-ethanol (95:5), the residue of which (containing compounds I, I-A, I-B and I-C) is alkylated with 2-iodopropane dissolved in acetone, using solid potassium hydroxide as a catalyst. The compounds are extracted from the reaction mixture into diethyl ether, after adding ethanol-water-acetic acid (55:40:5), the residue of which is dissolved in 0.05 M sulfuric acid, and reacted with mercuric acetate at 100 degrees C, which oxidizes tertiary tetrahydroisoquinolines to their 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline derivatives, followed by a photochemical reaction in the same solution to form intensely fluorescent isoquinolinium derivatives. An aliquot of this reaction mixture is injected onto a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column (5-microns Nova-Pac C13 phase in a radial compression cartridge, 10 cm X 8 mm), using the mobile phase 0.25 M triethylammonium phosphate (pH 2.5)-0.25 M acetic acid-methanol-acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran (150:350:125:375:25). The void volume (Vo) is approximately 1.4 min and the retention times (tR) of the respective isoquinolium derivatives of diclofensine (I) are ca. 3.5 min, internal standard (II) ca. 4.2 min, nordiclofensine (I-A) ca. 5 min, while the phenolic metabolites I-B and I-C give peaks at 6.4 min and 10.4 min, respectively. The derivatives are detected by fluorescence. The method was used to determine plasma concentrations of the parent drug (I) and its major phenolic metabolite I-B (aglycone) in plasma in two normal volunteers following a single oral 45-mg dose and following seven consecutive days of oral dosing of 45 mg three times a day as part of a multiple ascending dose tolerance study.", "PMC2649446": "The physiologic responses to an intense heat acclimation (HA) regimen (treadmill, 41.2 degrees C, 8 days, 56 min exercise/44 min rest) and the effects on stress and fluid balance hormone responses were examined in 13 unacclimated male volunteers. Venous blood samples were collected before (PRE) and after (POST) exercise (days 1, 4, 8) and analyzed for plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (ALD), cortisol (PC), plasma volume shifts (delta PV%), sodium concentration (Na+), and potassium concentration (K+). HA responses (day 1 vs day 8) indicated reduced strain (P less than 0.05): decreased heart rate, rectal temperature, skin temperature, improved defense of PV, and attenuated PC responses. While plasma Na+ demonstrated no change during daily exercise, K+ (P less than 0.01), PC, PRA, and ALD increased (P less than 0.05) more than delta PV%(day 1: -7.1%, day 8: -5.1%) accounted for. Na+ and K+ did not change as a result of HA, and there was no change in fluid balance hormones (e.g., PRA, ALD). It was concluded that this intense heat acclimation regimen reduced physiologic strain by mechanisms other than alterations in fluid balance hormones and offered few physiologic advantages which cannot be gained through conventional heat acclimation techniques (e.g., walking).", "PMC4032556": "A case of ureteral triplication associated with contralateral ureteral duplication and bilateral extravesical ectopic ureter is reported.

A comparable increase in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) activity was seen. Moreover, in the presence of L-carnitine and at pyruvate concentration greater than 0.25 mM, this effect was associated with a marked increase of acetylcarnitine synthesis. Deoxycarnitine, an inhibitor of carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT), partially reversed the effect of carnitine on PDHC activity. The stimulatory effect of carnitine on PDHC activity in human mitochondria is mediated by the modulation of the intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio.", "PMC3876125": "The role in platelet function of the cell-binding region of fibronectin was explored by the use of synthetic peptides. The prototypical peptide gly-arg-gly-asp-ser was capable of inhibiting thrombin-induced platelet aggregation without altering the degree of platelet activation as judged by the secretion of 14C-serotonin. The peptide also effectively inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the binding of radiolabeled fibronectin to platelets and the adhesion of platelets to fibronectin substrates. The smallest peptide from the cell-binding region of fibronectin which retained full activity was arg-gly-asp-ser. Transposition of amino acids or conservative substitutions of amino acids within this short sequence resulted in inactive peptides. Peptides containing the arg-gly-asp-ser sequence were also capable of inhibiting the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor substrates. Examination of the entire panel of synthetic peptides for ability to inhibit adhesion to fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor substrates revealed the same structure-function relationships that had been determined in the studies with fibronectin.", "PMC4004251": "Three analogs of the COOH-terminal fragments of human somatotropin (HGH), namely [Nle170,Ala165,182]-HGH-(150-187), [Nle170,Ala165,182]-HGH-(152-187), and [Nle170,Ala165,182]-HGH-(154-187), have been synthesized by the solid-phase method.

The injuries sustained are compared to see if the clinical impressions that BMX are more dangerous, and produce more facial injuries, are correct. This was found not to be true as half the children involved rode BMX bicycles, and the injuries sustained were similar to those occurring to non BMX riders. BMX riders had a lower proportion of serious injuries than riders of racing cycles. There were a large number of head injuries needing admission to hospital, but BMX riders had fewer head injuries than the other groups. The use of protective headgear was minimal. Facial injuries were evenly distributed between BMX and non BMX groups. The major cause of accidents to BMX riders was performing stunts but, overall, poor cycling technique associated with minimal cycling experience were the factors common to 50% of accidents.", "PMC3036663": "We describe two types of new Tn1721-derivatives capable of random insertion and of generating transcriptional fusions at the site of insertion: transposable promoters (Tn1735) carrying a strong, inducible ptac promoter that turns on adjacent (cryptic) genes; and transposable promoter probes (Tn1736, Tn1737) carrying promoterless genes coding for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase or beta-galactosidase, and used to accurately determine the expression of external promoters.

On the other hand, at equieffective spasmolytic concentrations (1.1 mM), procaine markedly inhibited Vmax as well as other electrophysiological parameters. These experiments indicate that at fully effective spasmolytic concentrations OB is devoid of local anaesthetic properties. In concentrations up to 10 microM OB did not affect phosphodiesterase activity in crude homogenates of rat colon which were inhibited by both papaverine (EC50 = 0.7 mM) and theophylline (EC50 = 3.5 mM). OB was more effective in antagonizing spasmogen-induced contractions on colonic as compared to tracheal preparations.

On the 1-year ECGs large Q waves (MC 1.1) were more common in patients with a history of previous MI than in those with a first MI. Regression of Q-QS, ST segment, and T wave changes occurred more extensively in first MIs, whereas progression of MC Q-QS and ST segment signs tended to be common in those with recurrent MI. On the acute ECGs large Q waves were more frequent in men (52%) than in women (36%), but ST segment depression of 1 mm or more (MC 4.1) was predominant in women in both the acute and 1-year ECGs. This ECG sign was related to the advanced age of the patients. There was no significant sex difference in the regression of the Q-QS signs, but the disappearance of ST and T wave changes occurred more extensively in men.

The effect was registered as the incorporation of labelled thymidine detected by liquid scintillation counting. The experiments were performed in intra and interspecific combinations, using bovine, pig or rat aortic cell cultures. The endothelial cells stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation in a species specific way. In interspecies combinations either inhibition or no effect was observed. The smooth muscle cells usually had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of endothelial cells except for the pig smooth muscle cells which had a stimulatory effect in both inter and intraspecies combinations. Co-cultivation of smooth muscle or endothelial cells with cells of the same type resulted mostly in inhibition or no effect in both intra and interspecies combinations. This phenomenon was particularly conspicuous with endothelial cells. The different stimulatory and inhibitory effects produced by these cells may play an important role in the regulation of neovascularization and in reendothelization of denuded intimal areas.", "PMC3005806": "Two gentamicin resistant strains of Klebsiella were isolated at different times from patients with hospital acquired urinary tract infections.

To evaluate nasal epithelial function in neonates with CF, the PD was recorded and the voltage response to superfusion of 10(-5M) amiloride, an inhibitor of sodium transport, measured between a Ringer perfused bridge on the nasal mucosa and a reference electrode in the subcutaneous space. We studied three neonates with CF with meconium ileus and compared the results with those in 24 term healthy neonates, including one obligate heterozygote for CF, and 27 control neonates with disease. All three CF neonates had raised sweat chloride values (mean 100 mEq/L) at 2 months. The CF neonates had higher PDs (-64.0 +/- 8.4 mV) than those in normal (-24.4 +/- 2.0 mV) or control (-25.8 +/- 2.0 mV) neonates. Superfusion with amiloride induced a 72% reduction in PD in the CF neonates as compared with healthy (37.5 +/- 1.0%) and diseased (36.0 +/- 1.3%) neonates. The PD and amiloride response in CF neonates are similar to those in CF infants (2.24 months), older CF children (greater than 6 years), and CF adults (-64.9 +/- 9.3 mV; 77.7 +/- 1.8%, n = 51). These results suggest that (1) nasal epithelial dysfunction is present in patients with CF shortly after birth, and (2) the nasal PD may be a diagnostic adjunct to the sweat test in the early diagnosis of CF.", "PMC3198449": "Psychoanalytic medicine can incorporate information from the neurosciences to expand anatomic characterology through new knowledge of brain function.

This study questioned whether enhanced hematopoiesis was a result of progressive tumor growth or whether the injection of tumor cells could evoke the response. By use of groups of C57BL/6 mice given an injection of live LLC cells, x-irradiated killed LLC cells, or media, the hematopoietic response to live LLC cells versus dead LLC cells could be dissected. A biphasic colony-stimulating activity (CSA) response in the sera of tumor bearers was found to account for the myelopoietic changes. The first wave of CSA from days 1 to 3 PI stimulated 168 +/- 3.7% more GM-CFUC than control sera and was likely released by dead cells of the tumor inoculum; the second wave from day 7 onward stimulated 220 +/- 7.6% more colonies and was a result of the enlarging tumor mass.

Birds were maintained under a 16L:8D cycle, with free access to feed and water at all times. In a second experiment, secretory capacity was evaluated by administering a 10 micrograms/kg body weight dose of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH). Blood samples were removed at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min post-infusion of either TRH or saline (control). All birds displayed pulsatile patterns of GH secretion, with an average peak duration of 60 min and a 90 min inter-peak interval. Dyschondroplastic birds exhibited 50% higher mean peak amplitudes than normal birds (P less than .06), however, this difference was not translated into overall mean or total (curve area) differences. The magnitude of response to a TRH challenge was greater (P less than .10) for TD than for normal birds. In view of the relationships observed in other species between secretory pattern characteristics such as peak amplitude, and growth characteristics, it is suggested that differences in GH status of dyschondroplastic relative to normal birds may be related to initiation of the TD lesion.", "PMC3116919": "BO-1236, a new cephalosporin having an N-methyl-5,6-dihydroxyisoindolinium moiety on the 3-methylene of the cephem, showed potent activity against gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Concentrations of antipyrine and D2O in uterine arterial and venous blood and antipyrine in fetal arterial and umbilical venous blood, as well as middle uterine arterial blood flow (electromagnetic transducer), were determined. Antipyrine and D2O gave similar estimates (steady-state diffusion method) of gravid uterine blood flow. In addition, the slope of the regression of D2O on antipyrine estimates was not different (P greater than 0.10) from one. Electromagnetic transducers gave estimates of uterine blood flow that were 32-42% of those obtained with steady-state diffusion but were correlated (P less than 0.05) with estimates obtained by use of both antipyrine and D2O. The transplacental clearance rate of antipyrine was similar (per kg placenta) to that observed in ewes.

In asthmatic patients, LTC4 produced oxygen desaturation on two occasions. At a lower dose (2.0 nmol) LTC4 produced a marked fall in SaO2% that lasted less than 15 min and occurred in the absence of significant bronchoconstriction as measured by changes in FEV1, FEF25-75, and SGaw. At a higher cumulative dose (7 nmol), LTC4 caused prolonged oxygen desaturation with slow recovery and this was associated with significant bronchoconstriction. In contrast, histamine inhalation produced a single response with a fall in both FEV1 and SaO2% of short duration. The dose-response characteristics of LTC4 and histamine on oxygen desaturation in asthmatic patients appear to differ significantly and probably are dependent on relative sensitivities of pulmonary vascular and bronchial smooth muscle to these agonists. A single inhaled dose of LTC4 in nonasthmatic subjects produced a marked drop in PaO2 with significant increase in AaPO2, and this was associated with a mean (SEM) decrease in FEV1 of 14% (2.5) from the baseline.

EEG patterns included number, amplitude, and contralateral propagation of type B spikes and occurrence and duration of type C tonic-clonic discharges. EMG patterns included changes in muscular multiple-unit activity time locked to the onset of type B spikes and to the onset and end of type C tonic-clonic EEG paroxysmal discharges. The lesions persistently blocked the orienting response to visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli to both sides in all cats and produced other neurologic symptoms partially or totally recovered in some cats. The lesions significantly increased the number, amplitude, and contralateral propagation of type B EEG spikes and the occurrence, but not the duration, of type C EEG tonic-clonic discharges. Ipsi- and contralateral adversion of the tonic phase were completely blocked and the muscular contractions of the clonic phase were reduced and delayed. These facts suggest that in intact epileptic cats, the mesencephalic reticular formation has an ascending suppressive influence on the mechanism related to EEG spike generation and precipitation of seizures but also a descending facilitatory control on the corticospinal epileptic impulses mediated through pyramidal and extrapyramidal pathways.", "PMC3569604": "Effect of ergot alkaloids on (3H)-nucleosides uptake by dispersed cells from fresh female bovine anterior pituitary glands was examined, because we had interested in the mechanism of pituitary tumor regression following bromocriptine treatment and considered nucleic acid synthesis as an important process in the metabolism of these cells. The anterior pituitary cells were implanted on culture tubes using D-valine minimal essential medium with serum to suppress the overgrowth of fibroblasts and then maintained in L-valine Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. (3H)-Uridine uptake by these cells was suppressed by bromocriptine, at-ergocriptine or ergotamine at a concentration varing from 10(-6) M to 10(-5) M, but not 10(-5) M of lergotrile. Among these alkaloids, bromocriptine had most strong inhibitory effect and suppressed the uptake to below 25% of control value at the concentration of 10(-5) M. Bromocriptine also inhibited the uptake of (3H)-thymidine, (3H)-cytidine, (3H)-adenosine or (3H)-guanosine in the same manner as (3H)-uridine. But neither (3H)-uracil, the base of uridine, nor (3H)-galactose uptake by cells was affected by bromocriptine. The incorporation of (3H)-uridine or (3H)-thymidine into TCA-insoluble fraction of the cells was also inhibited by bromocriptine as that in the total cells. It was suspected that bromocriptine acted on distinct transport site of both ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside, because a high concentration (3.3 X 10(-5) M) of radio-inactive thymidine did not modify (3H)-uridine uptake by these cells as well as inhibitory effect of bromocriptine on it. These effect of bromocriptine were not blocked by haloperidol, known as dopamine antagonist, at the same concentration as bromocriptine, and dopamine had no effect on (3H)-uridine uptake by the cells. In addition, by adding 5 X 10(-4) M of dibutyryl cyclic AMP into the medium, the effect of bromocriptine was also not affected. These data suggest that the effect of bromocriptine on nucleoside transport in anterior pituitary cells may be dependent on the other binding site than D-2 dopamine receptor in the anterior pituitary cell membrane.", "PMC4010296": "Scores from 13 cognitive-neuropsychological tests administered to 245 men alcoholics were subjected to an average linkage cluster analysis. Six subtypes were derived but three were eliminated from further analyses because they had samples of less than 10. The remaining clusters appeared to reflect differing levels and patterns of neuropsychological functioning. Subsequent analyses indicated that the clusters were related to age but were independent of most other demographic and pretreatment alcohol-related variables. Significant associations were found between cluster membership and the likelihood of abstinence, completion of aftercare therapy and employment status over a 9-month follow-up period. Although this relationship to outcome is encouraging, neuropsychological status accounted for only a limited amount of the variance. The findings suggest the need to broaden the base of assessment, using multiple domains, in future attempts to derive meaningful subtypes within an alcoholic population.", "PMC3032607": "The in vitro activity of LY146032, a new cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and either oxacillin or ampicillin by determining agar dilution MIC values for 304 clinical gram-positive isolates. LY146032 had superior in vitro activity against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci when compared to vancomycin or teicoplanin. Against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci, group JK-diphtheroids, streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile, LY146032 was equally or less active than vancomycin, teicoplanin, or the penicillins tested. When tested by macrobroth dilution MIC/MBC, LY146032 showed good bactericidal activity against all organisms with the exception of Clostridium difficile.", "PMC2822856": "S-100 protein in clonal GA-1 and C6 rat glioma cell lines was released in serum-free medium supplemented with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The induction of S-100 protein release by ACTH was dose-dependent, showing a half-maximal release at about 5 microM, and the S-100 protein concentration in the medium increased sharply within 3 min, but slightly during further incubation. The S-100 protein release was apparently accompanied by a decrease in the membrane-bound form of S-100 protein in the cell. The S-100 protein release was induced not by the ACTH1-24 fragment, which exhibits the known effects of ACTH, but by the ACTH18-39 fragment, which is designated as corticotropin-like intermediate-lobe peptide (CLIP). These results indicate that the C-terminal half of ACTH is responsible for the S-100 protein release. The enhancement of S-100 protein release by ACTH was also observed in normal rat glioblasts. The release induced by ACTH was apparently specific to S-100 protein, because little release of the cytoplasmic enzymes, creatine kinase, and enolase was observed under the same conditions. High concentrations (5 mM) of dibutyryl cyclic AMP or dibutyryl cyclic GMP were also found to induce S-100 protein release; however, catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and dopamine), acetylcholine, and glutamic acid did not enhance the release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3758654": "DDAVP was administered intranasally (20 micrograms) and perorally (100 and 200 micrograms) to 6 hydrated volunteers. Urine was collected and blood was sampled at intervals for the following 6 hr. In all experiments DDAVP induced a marked and long lasting antidiuretic response. Radioimmunoassay of DDAVP in blood samples made it possible to calculate bioavailability of DDAVP after the two forms of administration. Following intranasal application 11.3% of the dose appeared in the blood and the figures for oral administration was 0.7-1.0%. Based on analysis of the amount of DDAVP excreted in the urine the urinary clearance rate was estimated to be 0.10 ml/min/kg body wt.", "PMC2929236": "We have investigated the effect of gestational age and fetal hypophysectomy on the growth and development of the adrenal gland of the fetal sheep. The area of the fetal sheep adrenal medulla increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from 3.21 +/- 0.42 mm2 at 90-107 days to 6.09 +/- 0.26 mm2 at 120-126 days of gestation and there was a further significant increase (P less than 0.05) in the newborn period to 9.48 +/- 0.85 mm2. The adrenomedullary area of the hypophysectomised fetal sheep (7.47 +/- 1.10 mm2) was not significantly different from that of the fetal sheep at 140-146 days of gestation or from that of the newborn lamb. The ratio of the area of the adrenal occupied by the cells which contained adrenaline (adrenaline zone) to the area of the adrenal occupied by the cells which contained noradrenaline (noradrenaline zone) was unchanged between 90 days of gestation and 12 days after birth. After hypophysectomy, the ratio of the adrenaline to noradrenaline zone was not significantly different from that in the adrenal medulla of the 140-146 days fetal sheep and the 10-12 days newborn lamb.", "PMC3436085": "Two brothers with Williams syndrome without hypercalcaemia are presented. One boy died during the first month of life. His brother also had the typical phenotypic features of the elfin facies. He developed severe microcephaly and cataract and died at the age of 9 years. The skeleton was osteosclerotic at birth, and became generally osteoporotic at the age of 2 years. He had persistently elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels during the first 2 years of life, in spite of normocalcaemia. At autopsy, microcalcifications were found in the brain and kidneys. The present report underscores the familial occurrence of Williams syndrome of severe degree. Elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels without hypercalcaemia have not been reported previously, and may suggest causal heterogeneity of the Williams syndrome.", "PMC3394793": "The ultrastructural features of idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP) were studied in 9 patients. As expected, the characteristic air space fibrosis was composed of spindled fibroblasts and myofibroblasts arranged concentrically within an electron-lucent stroma. In 6 patients there was evidence of incorporation of air space fibrosis into the interstitium. A surprising finding in all patients was the presence of extensive epithelial damage involving peribronchiolar alveolar septa. Necrosis and sloughing of alveolar lining cells resulted in denuding of epithelial basal laminae. Complex infoldings and deep invaginations of the denuded basal laminae into alveolar septa were common. These ultrastructural changes involving the interstitium are similar to those occurring in the interstitial pneumonias, and suggest that BOOP also results from acute epithelial injury. The different clinical manifestations and prognosis of these entities may relate to the peribronchiolar localization of the epithelial damage in BOOP compared with more diffuse involvement of distal lung in the interstitial pneumonias.", "PMC3907839": "The effects of a continuous iv infusion (osmotic minipumps) of angiotensin II (80 ng . kg-1 . min-1) and isoprenaline (10 ng . kg-1 . min-1) lasting 28 days were studied in six normotensive, conscious dogs. The parameters measured were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, levels of angiotensin II, renin activity, aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone in plasma, baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and body weight. The treatment resulted in an approximately sevenfold increase in plasma angiotensin II level from 62.9 +/- 24.5 pg . ml-1 to 455.3 +/- 95.6 pg . ml-1. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured for the first time 2 days after implanting the minipumps, were markedly increased throughout the infusion period (pretreatment value: 123.8 +/- 5.3/68.3 +/- 3.8 mmHg; after 2 days: 159.8 +/- 12.0/100.5 +/- 9.8 mmHg; after 28 days: 159.8 +/- 7.1/98.3 +/- 6.4 mmHg, whereas the heart rate remained unchanged due to the combined effects of angiotensin II and the concomitantly given isoprenaline. A high correlation was found between angiotensin II level in plasma and mean arterial blood pressure (r = 0.846; p less than 0.001). Furthermore, plasma renin activity was markedly suppressed by the treatment, and aldosterone levels rose. Plasma antidiuretic hormone levels were found to be unchanged at the chosen sampling time. A decrease in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity accompanied the development of the hypertensive state. There was also a loss of body weight during the infusion of angiotensin II and isoprenaline. The data provide evidence for the usefulness of the presented experimental protocol as an alternative model of arterial hypertension in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs.", "PMC3448610": "Injection of platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether) into the pleural cavity of rats induced the accumulation of a moderately intense exudate within 30 to 60 minutes. By comparison with animals given injections of the vehicle alone, the animals given this mediator had elevated levels of leukotriene C4-immunoreactive material (LTC4 im) in the exudate and decreased quantities of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and of 6-Keto-F1 alpha-prostaglandin (6-Keto PGF1 alpha). Nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem reduced the pleural exudate with no major effect on the mediators. Both salbutamol and theophylline reduced the exudate and the levels of LTC4 im. Acetylsalicylic acid, phenylbutazone and indomethacin significantly inhibited the exudate, greatly lowered the quantities of cyclooxygenase derivatives and tended to increase LTC4 im. Phenidone, which inhibits the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, decreased the exudate and the three mediators. The phospholipase A2 inhibitor, chloroquine, decreased both the amount of exudate and moderately the concentration of LTC4 im. The glucocorticoids studied had no effect on the exudate or on the mediators. These results suggest that the role of the increased LTC4 im in the induction of the pleurisy is not clear.", "PMC3855419": "Full-time Class II elastic forces were applied to eight rats in order to evaluate their effects on the growth of the snout and the mandible. Eight animals served as controls. Lateral cephalograms were taken at the start of the experiment and again at the end, 23 days later. The pre- and post-treatment tracings were superimposed on the cranial base to measure alterations in snout growth, and on metallic implants to measure differences in mandibular growth. As judged by t tests, Class II elastic forces caused a significant antero-posterior growth inhibition both in the snout and in the mandible.", "PMC3359968": "The DNA synthesis (S) phase of cultured GC cells, a clonal rat pituitary tumor cell line, is characterized by increases in nuclear receptors for T3 and glucocorticoid (G) hormones. However, this increased receptor abundance appears functionally dissociated from the GH gene since GH messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is decreased in S-phase cells. We have now examined a putative structural correlate of this dissociation by measuring the abundance of T3 and G receptors and the GH gene in the nuclear matrix (NM)/scaffold fraction. NM of control and S-phase cultures both contained 30-50% of G receptors. Thirty to 50% of T3 receptors were also localized to NM of asynchronous cultures, but T3 receptor abundance (femtomoles per 100 micrograms of protein) was significantly decreased in NM of S-phase cultures: Exp 1 (control, 140 +/- 6.2; S-phase, 56.5 +/- 0.8; Exp 2 (control, 170 +/- 12; S-phase, 105 +/- 2.4). Nuclear scaffolds were digested with restriction enzymes to solubilize DNA loop structures and probed with GH complementary DNA (cDNA) to examine the distribution of transcribed regions of the GH gene. EcoR1 digestion resulted in an 11 kilobase fragment including the reported regulatory sequences for T3 receptors. No specific differences in GH gene localization to nuclear scaffold were observed between asynchronous and S-phase cultures or in different hormonal states. Thus, GH gene localization to nuclear scaffolds was not correlated with changes in transcription induced by T3 and G hormones or position in the cell cycle. These studies suggest that decreased concentration of T3 receptors in the NM fraction of S-phase cultures may be a structural correlate for cell cycle regulation of T3 receptor function.", "PMC3140967": "To determine whether patients should participate directly in detecting adverse reactions to drugs their ability to provide written reports of symptoms experienced during treatment with amoxycillin or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was investigated. When compared with telephone interviews forms on which patients reported events were reliable (the observed agreement with the same statements posed during telephone calls was 85%, kappa = 0.56) and valid (sensitivity = 54%, specificity = 94%). Patients were also supplied with forms that invited them to report adverse reactions, and their perceptions were compared with those of a panel of experts, who were informed of all clinical events that had been reported during the detailed telephone interviews. Patients were more conservative than the experts in attributing clinical events to drug treatment. The extent of agreement varied and was notably poor for skin and bowel complaints (kappa = 0.13 in each case). The performance of event report forms and reaction report forms as instruments of detection was compared in a hypothetical situation in which the experts' views represented the \"truth\" about adverse reactions to a new drug. Event reporting had a higher sensitivity than reaction reporting (42% v 24%) but a lower specificity (58% v 98%). National centres monitoring adverse drug reactions should probably resist pressure to accept reports of reactions directly from the public, but a system based on large scale reporting of events might be valuable in aiding the early detection of symptomatic reactions to new drugs.", "PMC3124434": "The results of initial salvage therapy for refractory and relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia for patients treated between 1973 and 1986 have been evaluated. There was no significant improvement in complete remission (CR) rate and survival in patients treated between 1973 and 1980, and the second group between 1981 and 1986. The remission duration was slightly longer in the second time period than in the initial time period. A number of factors were associated with the probability of achieving a CR. The major factors were the age of the patient, duration of the initial CR, liver function test abnormalities, and white blood cell count.", "PMC3582443": "Urinary undiversion was performed in a 21-year-old man with a contracted flaccid bladder. The steps of the procedure were: bladder dilatation; antireflux implantation of an ileal conduit into the bladder; external sphincterotomy, and implantation of an artificial urethral sphincter. The patient is continent and has a good bladder capacity and emptying. In many patients with urinary ileal conduit diversion, upper urinary tract and stomal problems develop after some years. In these patients urinary undiversion must be considered but, so far, evaluation showing a high risk of postoperative incontinence has been regarded as a contraindication to urinary undiversion. However, the introduction of artificial urethral sphincters has made it possible to perform undiversion procedures in many of these patients in whom the bladder capacity and bladder emptying is acceptable, if a nonobstructed outlet is secured. We describe the findings and procedures in a patient undergoing urinary undiversion with implantation of an artificial sphincter 8 years after urinary diversion due to neurological disorders caused by a myelomeningocele.", "PMC3086902": "Three series of experiments were undertaken to determine whether the residual catecholamine (CA) terminals or intrinsic neurons of ventral tegmentum (VT) in rats given 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) after desmethylimipramine (DMI) in the lateral ventricles at birth, mediated VT self-stimulation (SS). In Experiment I, male pups were injected bilaterally on days 3 and 5 with 6-OHDA (total dose 200 micrograms) or with the vehicle after pretreatment with DMI (50 mg/kg, IP) 30 min earlier. Each subject, 150 days old, was implanted bilaterally in the VT with electrode-cannula units. Both the dopamine (DA)-depleted and control groups yielded similar percentages of self-stimulators. The rate of responding was, however, slightly but significantly lower in the DA-depleted group than in the controls. In Experiment II, 8 DA-depleted and 7 control rats were pretreated with pargyline (50 mg/kg, IP) and then given unilateral injections of 6-OHDA in the VT, in the tissue below the SS electrode. These intracerebral injections of 6-OHDA had no effect on VT SS in both groups. Seventeen controls and 12 DA-depleted rats, in Experiment III, were given injections of kainic acid (KA; 5 nM) either ipsilaterally or contralaterally. The ipsilateral injection abolished SS (14 days of testing), whereas the contralateral injection had no effects on ipsilateral SS in both groups. Histochemical fluorescence study in Experiment I and II showed that the neonatal treatment with DMI + 6-OHDA had reduced the number of DA-containing perikarya in the VT and that reinjection of 6-OHDA into the VT caused the disappearance of the residual CA terminals in tissue surrounding the electrode tip.", "PMC3030567": "We show that the yeast HAP1 activator locus encodes a protein that binds in vitro to the upstream activation site, UAS1, of the CYC1 gene (iso-1-cytochrome c). Binding of wild-type HAP1 and truncated HAP1 derivatives to UAS1 is evident in crudely fractionated yeast extracts using the gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay. The binding of HAP1 in vitro, like the activity of UAS1 in vivo, is stimulated by heme. HAP1 binds to region B, one of two portions of UAS1 shown to be important by genetic analysis of the site. Surprisingly, HAP1 binds to the same sequence as a second factor, RC2. Both HAP1 and RC2 bind to the same side of the helix, and make similar but not identical major and minor groove contacts that span two full turns. An additional factor that binds to the second important part of UAS1, the region A factor (RAF), is also identified. A model depicting the interplay of HAP1, RC2, and RAF in the control of UAS1 is presented.", "PMC3115959": "Strains I-110 ARS, SR, USDA 136, USDA 137, and AK13 1c of Bradyrhizobium japonicum induced Hup activity when growing heterotrophically in medium with carbon substrate and NH4Cl in the presence of 2% H2 and 2% O2. Hup activity was induced during heterotrophic growth in the presence of carbon substrates, which were assimilated during the time of H2 oxidation. Strains I-110 ARS and SR grown heterotrophically or chemoautotrophically for 3 days had similar rates of H2 oxidation. Similar rates of Hup activity were also observed when cell suspensions were induced for 24 h in heterotrophic or chemoautotrophic growth medium with 1% O2, 10% H2, and 5% CO2 in N2. These results are contrary to the reported repression of Hup activity by carbon substrates in B. japonicum. Bradyrhizobial Hup activity during heterotrophic growth was limited by H2 and O2 and repressed by aerobic conditions, and CO2 addition had no effect. Nitrogenase and ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase activities were not detected in H2-oxidizing cultures of B. japonicum during heterotrophic growth. Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts with antibodies prepared against the 65-kilodalton subunit of uptake hydrogenase indicated that Hup protein synthesis was induced by H2 and repressed under aerobic conditions.", "PMC3419161": "Hepatic cytosols from male and female vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus pygerythrus) were found to contain the same levels of high affinity estrogen-binding proteins. Multipoint saturation analyses revealed that male liver cytosols contain two distinctly different binding components: a high affinity (HAEB) and a low affinity estrogen binder (LAEB). Female livers appeared to contain only the HAEB. Sucrose density gradient (SDG) analyses, however, clearly established the presence of a 3.8 S as well as an 8.1 S estrogen-binding component in the hepatic cytosols of both sexes. The 3.8 S binding component appeared to be more prominent in male SDG profiles. Cytosols, prepared in the presence of sodium molybdate (cyt +) exhibited significantly lower (50%) levels of specific estrogen-binding than cytosols prepared in the absence of the oxyanion (cyt-). SDG analyses, however, indicated that in cyt+ the 8.1 S binding component was stabilized at the cost of the 3.8 S binder. This phenomenon was observed in both sexes. Large excess levels of cortisol did not have any effect on specific estrogen binding by hepatic cytosols. The hepatic estrogen-binding proteins displayed a lower relative binding affinity for diethylstilbestrol than for its native ligand and higher affinities for estriol and estrone than expected.", "PMC2717803": "Two cases of autoptically observed congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) in a newborn and in an infant, one with electron photomicrographs, are presented. In contrast to the adjacent RPE cells, the apical cellular surface of CHRPE cells shows only rare small microvilli, mostly at the cell border. The prominent findings are large pigment granules from 3.5 to 8 microns protruding towards the apical cellular surface. These macromelanosomes do not exhibit coalescence as noted by others, but show a concentric lamellar structure that may be the result of a disturbed development sequence in melanin granule formation. The authors' observation of CHRPE in a newborn and in an infant suggests that the term congenital HRPE is appropriate. The presence of these changes at this early age is consistent with the condition being a primary failure of differentiation. Finally, the authors present evidence of a disturbed melanogenesis in CHRPE cells resulting in macromelanosomes formation.", "PMC3336936": "The Scott sphincter models AS 791 and AS 800 were implanted in 22 men with urinary incontinence. Urethral pressure profilometry was used intraoperatively and postoperatively to measure the urethral closure pressure (UCP) and to improve the rate of continence and reduce the risk of erosion. Success was achieved in 20 of 24 patients. The utility of urethral profilometry in these cases is described.", "PMC2724292": "The binding of selective muscarinic receptor antagonists to regions of rat brain was examined through quantitative autoradiographic techniques. 5,11-Dihydro-11-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)acetyl]-6H- pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one [pirenzepine (compound I)] and 11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one [AF-DX 116 (compound II)] were chosen on the basis of their selectivity for M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors, respectively, and similarities in chemical structure. Pirenzepine displayed a higher potency than II for inhibition of [3H]-l-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-l-QNB) binding to rat brain sections. Scatchard analyses of binding to brain sections revealed heterogeneous binding profiles for both antagonists, suggesting the presence of multiple receptor binding sites. Quantitative autoradiographic techniques were utilized in regional analyses of antagonist binding. Pirenzepine displayed the highest affinity for hippocampal, striatal, and amygdaloid muscarinic receptors (IC50 values less than 0.4 microM), with a slightly lower affinity for cortical receptors (IC50 values between 0.4 and 0.8 microM). Pirenzepine displayed the lowest affinity for thalamic and brainstem regions with IC50 values generally greater than 1.0 microM. In contrast, II bound with higher affinity to muscarinic receptors in brainstem, cerebellar, and hypothalamic nuclei (IC50 values less than 0.5 microM) than to receptors in thalamic nuclei (IC50 values between 0.5 and 2.0 microM). Binding sites with the lowest affinity for II were found in cortical, striatal, and hippocampal regions (IC50 values greater than 2.0 microM). The binding profiles of the two selective muscarinic antagonists reveal the complexity and diversity of muscarinic receptor subtypes throughout the brain. The data provide a basis for identifying muscarinic receptor subtypes (as defined through cloning procedures) with selective ligands. Minimum-energy conformations of pirenzepine and II were calculated by using the program MacroModel (version 2.0). Pirenzepine displayed three energy minima, differing in the relative position of the piperazine ring with respect to the tricyclic system. In contrast, the (diethylamino)methyl substituent on the piperidine ring conferred a much larger set of minimum-energy conformations on II. It is suggested that the greater conformational flexibility of the side chain allows II to achieve a conformation inaccessible to pirenzepine, which allows it to bind preferentially to M2 receptors.", "PMC4018336": "Atypical measles with high fever, pneumonitis, erythematous papular and pustular rash occurred in a 16-year-old girl who had been vaccinated with the inactivated (killed) virus 15 years ago.", "PMC3930497": "A tyrosinase has been purified from the skin of the frog Xenopus laevis. Dihydroxyphenylalanine oxidase and tyrosine hydroxylase activities co-purify throughout the procedure. The enzyme is isolated in an inactive form, but both enzymatic activities are activated by a variety of anionic detergents. Of these, sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO4) is the most effective. The enzyme activation occurs at NaDodSO4 concentrations well below the critical micelle concentration and it remains active at concentrations as high as 30 mM (1%). Neither activity is stimulated by cationic or nonionic detergents, or a variety of other agents, including trypsin. The purified tyrosinase is a glycoprotein having a polypeptide Mr = 175,000 by NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This monomeric species is enzymatically active in the presence of NaDodSO4. Detergent-activated tyrosinase has a KM for dihydroxyphenylalanine of 6 X 10(-4) M and a KM for tyrosine of 4 X 10(-4) M. Both activities are inhibited by copper chelators but not by an iron chelator.

The purified plasminogen activator was inactive and had a single-chain structure and a Mr of 50,000. It not only did not incorporate diisopropyl fluorophosphate, which reacts with active site serine residue in urokinase, but also did not bind to p-aminobenzamidine-immobilized CH-Sepharose, to which urokinase bind via its side-chain binding pocket present in active center. The plasminogen activator was converted to the active two-chain form with the same Mr by catalytic amounts of plasmin. Its potential enzymatic activity was quenched completely by anti-urokinase IgG, but not by anti-tissue plasminogen activator Ig. These results indicate that the plasminogen activator is an inactive proenzyme form of human urokinase. Therefore, the plasminogen activator was termed single-chain pro-urokinase. The cleavage of single-chain pro-urokinase by plasmin induced conformational change which followed the generation of reactive serine residue at active site, the increase enzyme activity and the reduction of its high affinity for fibrin. These findings suggest that conformational change occurs in both regions responsible for enzyme activity and affinity for fibrin upon activation of single-chain pro-urokinase.", "PMC3397511": "Faecal cultures were established using bovine faeces containing known numbers of eggs from either Oesophagostomum radiatum, Haemonchus placei, Cooperia pectinata or a mixture of all three. A substantially greater percentage of larvae was recovered from cultures of O. radiatum and C. pectinata than was recovered from cultures of H. placei. The same pattern was observed in mixed cultures although yields of larvae from all species in mixed cultures were significantly reduced (p less than 0.001). The lower recovery of H. placei was not associated with a lower viability of H. placei eggs. Of the three different methods of harvesting larvae, the jar and mesh recovery technique was the least effective and significantly fewer larvae were recovered with this technique than with the Baermann and inversion techniques (p less than 0.05). The results are discussed with reference to the use of faecal culture and larval differentiation in the diagnosis of mixed species nematode infections of cattle.", "PMC3633967": "This paper describes a model for involving staff in a service setting in nursing research.

Km-values for the neuronal uptake of 12 substrates were determined as the IC50 of the unlabelled substrate inhibiting the initial rate of neuronal uptake of 0.2 mumol/l 3H-(-)-noradrenaline. The IC50 ranged from 0.35 mumol/l (for(+)-amphetamine) to 44.3 mumol/l (for 5-HT). The Vmax (determined for 8 substrates) was substrate-dependent. 2. Tissues were loaded with 0.2 mumol/l 3H-(-)-noradrenaline and then washed out with amine-free solution. All 12 substrates of uptake1 induced an outward transport of 3H-noradrenaline, and equieffective concentrations were positively correlated with Km. Moreover, the EC50 for release greatly exceeded Km. It is proposed that this discrepancy between EC50 and Km is indicative of the fact that at least four factors (each one in strict dependence on Km) contribute to the initiation of outward transport of 3H-noradreanline: a) the appearance of the carrier on the inside of the axonal membrane (facilitated exchange diffusion), b) the co-transport of Na+, c) the co-transport of Cl- (both lowering the Km for 3H-noradrenaline at the inside carrier), and d) inhibition of the re-uptake of released 3H-noradrenaline (through competition for the outside carrier). 3. At least for amezinium, Vmax appears to limit the maximum rate of outward transport. 4. For some substrates (especially for the highly lipophilic ones) bell-shaped concentration-release curves were obtained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC4059247": "Osteoclasts have been isolated out of the bone marrow of laying hens kept on a low calcium diet for eight days. After purification the cells are cultured in a DMEM suspension. Development of the incubated single cells was observed up to 34 days and morphological changes are reported. No major difference could be found if the osteoclasts were kept on acrylic dishes or on gas permeable teflon dishes as a ground substrate.", "PMC3211256": "An unusual case of myxoma of the skull extending into the orbital cavity is reported. Myxoma is a benign tumour of the soft tissues and maxillary bones, which often presents infiltrating growth and recurrences. Histologically it is characterized by abundant myxoid stroma and is often confused with other tumours which can present mucoid degeneration. Although diagnosis is impossible before histological examination, the possibility of a myxoma must be considered in the presence of extradural osteolytic poorly vascularized lesions.", "PMC3989243": "Plasma neuroleptic levels in 41 patients (21 men, 20 women, aged 18 to 74) on haloperidol therapy were examined in relation to their age by means of radioreceptor assay. There was no significant difference among three age groups (below 45 years, 46 to 60 years, over 60 years) in the ratio of the plasma neuroleptic level to daily dose (nM/mg/kg), but a significant difference in the plasma neuroleptic level was found between the average values in parkinsonian (19.1 +/- 8.5 nM, M +/- SD) and nonparkinsonian (5.5 +/- 3.0 nM, M +/- SD) patients. There was, however, no significant difference in the incidence of parkinsonian symptoms between the young (below 60 years) and the old (over 60 years) age groups. These results suggest that in contrast to the previously reported study with chlorpromazine, the plasma neuroleptic level of haloperidol is not altered with aging and that parkinsonian symptoms induced by haloperidol occur simply in a plasma-neuroleptic-level-dependent manner.", "PMC3281121": "The metabolic consequences of a prolonged gestation (35 vs 32 days) have been studied in the rabbit fetus. Gestation was prolonged by daily subcutaneous injections of progesterone (1.5 mg.kg-1) from day 28 to 34. In control animals, progesterone was injected from day 25 or 28 to day 31 of gestation. When the capacities for gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, measured on isolated hepatocytes, are normally low in the term control fetus and increase only within the first 24 h after birth, these capacities appear high in the postmature fetus. The rate of glucose production from lactate is 4-fold higher in the postmature fetus than in the normal term fetus. The rate of ketone body production from oleate is also 5-fold higher in the postmature fetus, which results from a switch on of the partition of oleate into esterification and oxidation: 8% of [1-14C]oleate is oxidized in term fetus hepatocytes, but 34% in postmature fetus hepatocytes. As a similar rate of lipogenesis takes place in both stages, this metabolic change could be explained by a 5-fold lower sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I to the inhibition by malonyl-coenzyme A. Postmaturity decreases plasma insulin concentrations by 45% and increases plasma glucagon concentrations by 50% which, in turn, induces a 3-fold decrease in the plasma insulin:glucagon molar ratio. As previously shown in fasted or diabetic adult rat, this hormonal change might be a likely candidate for an enhancement of gluconeogenic and ketogenic capacity in the liver of the postterm rabbit fetus.", "PMC3597598": "An improved synthesis of a chemically bonded electron acceptor, namely tetrachlorophthalimidopropyl silica, is described.

Eighty-six unpremedicated, unrestrained, untrained mongrel dogs were given one of eight doses of fentanyl citrate (125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 micrograms/kg) as a single intravenous bolus injection. Dogs breathed spontaneously without oxygen supplementation. Anesthesia was assessed every 5 min until absence of anesthesia was recorded for two consecutive evaluations. Venous plasma samples were obtained in two or three dogs receiving each of the doses of fentanyl 5 min after fentanyl injection and again when application of the tail clamp elicited either vocalization or movement (positive response). Fentanyl resulted in recumbency in all animals except two receiving 125 micrograms/kg. Although all doses of fentanyl produced anesthesia in at least one animal 5 min after injection, the duration of anesthesia was short, responses unpredictable, and anesthesia achieved in all animals only with a dose of 3000 micrograms/kg. Increasing doses of fentanyl resulted in higher plasma fentanyl concentrations 5 min after injection and at the time of the first positive response to tail clamp but there was great variability. All doses of fentanyl caused statistically significant decreases in heart and respiratory rates but none produced apnea or a PaCO2 higher than 67 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3370244": "Using the liposomes prepared from dimyristoyl lecithin at temperature below that of phase transition, its was shown that the annealing of liposomes by 340- and 800-MHz microwave radiation required less integral heating of the samples, than it should be expected from the experiments on heating the samples in a thermostat.", "PMC3945110": "The issue of whether patients who have invasive carcinoma in an otherwise benign polyp should undergo surgical resection of that bowel segment is controversial. We examined the records of 83 patients with such polyps that were removed endoscopically between 1978 and 1981. After exclusion of 18 patients from the study for various reasons, our study group consisted of 65 patients who had undergone complete endoscopic removal of 69 polyps that contained a malignant process. Carcinoma in situ was found in 34 polyps, and 3 patients with such polyps had a recurrent malignant lesion of the same degree. These recurrent tumors were treated successfully by aggressive endoscopic removal. Seventeen polyps that contained invasive carcinoma were treated endoscopically without resection, and two patients in this group subsequently had recurrent carcinoma at the site of the original polyp. These recurrent lesions were resected, and neither patient had evidence of nodal metastasis. Of the 18 patients who underwent immediate resection of invasive carcinoma, 2 had residual carcinoma at the time of the resection, although no lymph node metastasis was found. We conclude that colonic polyps with carcinoma in situ can be treated safely with complete endoscopic removal. Invasive carcinoma in a polyp can be treated safely with complete polypectomy, and immediate resection may not be necessary. This group of patients, however, should undergo thorough follow-up studies and periodic endoscopic reexamination.", "PMC3281905": "The hole-forming toxin aerolysin was shown to aggregate after binding to erythrocytes at 37 degrees C. Although the protein also bound and aggregated at 4 degrees C, hole formation was not observed, indicating that aggregation preceded penetration of the lipid bilayer. Aggregation, but not binding, could be blocked by pretreatment of the toxin with diethyl pyrocarbonate, a histidine-reactive reagent. This resulted in inactivation of the toxin. Incubation of aerolysin with glycophorin purified from human erythrocytes caused aggregation and complete inactivation. Erythrocytes which lacked glycophorin were less sensitive to the toxin. Proaerolysin, the inactive precursor of aerolysin, also bound to erythrocytes; however, it did not aggregate, nor did it aggregate when preincubated with glycophorin. The protoxin could be activated by treatment with trypsin even after it had bound to erythrocytes. Activation could also be achieved by reaction of proaerolysin with a variety of other proteases, each of which brought about a similar reduction in protein molecular weight. The activated protein was resistant to further proteolysis. These results indicate that aggregation is a necessary step in hole formation and that the sites on aerolysin required for binding and for aggregation and hole formation are separate.", "PMC3290109": "The infectivity to mosquitoes of 31 acute Plasmodium vivax patients was measured by permitting mosquitoes to feed directly on the patients. The infectivity of these patients correlated closely with titers of antibodies in their serum as measured by indirect immunofluorescence against air-dried female gametes of P. vivax. Infectivity by direct feeding was also closely parallel to the transmission-blocking activity of the sera of patients as measured by the suppression of infectivity of parasitized blood by autologous serum relative to normal (nonmalarial) human serum when fed to mosquitoes through a membrane. These results are consistent with serum antibodies in human P. vivax infections as major factors determining the infectivity of an infected individual to mosquitoes. It was further noted that individuals having a second attack of P. vivax within less than 4 months were considerably less infectious to mosquitoes than first-attack patients were. This \"boosting\" of transmission-blocking immunity was much less if longer intervals intervened between attacks. We discuss the immunological implications and possible epidemiological significance of this short-term boosting of transmission-blocking immunity by successive P. vivax infections.", "PMC3203869": "The hormonal regulation of fat body glycogen phosphorylase activity in Manduca sexta larvae was studied. During the first 3 hr of starvation the corpora cardiaca (CC) release a glycogen phosphorylase-activating hormone (GPAH). The haemolymph of 24-hr-starved larvae seems to contain increased levels of GPAH, but after 48 hr the titre can be assumed to be as low as prior to starvation. Abdominal stretch receptors do not appear to be involved in the regulation of GPAH release from the CC. Phosphorylase activation can be prevented by the injection of glucose or by feeding the animals with agar containing various carbohydrates. These treatments seem to prevent the release of GPAH from the CC rather than the action of GPAH on the fat body. The physiological signal which initiates peptide release remains unclear.", "PMC3875450": "Faecal blood loss arising from tenoxicam at a dose of 20 mg/day was compared to that arising from piroxicam at a dose of 20 mg/day in a double-blind, parallel comparative study in 12 healthy male volunteers. Faecal blood loss was measured for a 1-week run-in on placebo, during 4 weeks of treatment and for a 2-week post-treatment period in both groups. Plasma levels for tenoxicam and piroxicam confirmed good compliance in all subjects. Mean blood loss during the placebo run-in period was 0.35 ml/day. Mean blood loss during treatment with tenoxicam was 0.84 ml/day and with piroxicam 0.81 ml/day. There was no significant difference between these measurements. On cessation of treatment, faecal blood loss continued both in the tenoxicam group (mean 1.30 ml/day) and piroxicam group (mean 1.41 ml/day). The difference between these was not statistically significant. No significant haematological or biochemical abnormality resulted from either of the two trial drugs during the period of the study.

The test agents, in part available on the market, includes two Candida mouthrinses containing 1508 and 330 ppm F, respectively, Act containing 308 ppm F, a zinc fluoride-hexetidine (ZH) combination containing 287 ppm F, and an amine fluoride 297/SnF2 (AmF/SnF2) combination containing 241 ppm F. The volunteers rinsed with 10 ml of the above solutions for 30 s each. The oral fluoride concentration was reduced to 1 ppm 99 min after rinsing with Candida original. With the AmF/SnF2 solution, the oral fluoride concentration remained above 1 ppm for 39 min, and for about 20 min after rinsing with Candida reduced, ZH and Act. With both Candida original and ZH significant fluoride levels in the oral fluid were still found after 3 h, while with AmF/SnF2 and Act significant fluoride levels lasted for 2 h. A specific clearance value was determined for each mouthrinse, reflecting the ability of the agent to remain attached to the oral structures. The AmF/SnF2-rinse had a rapid clearance value. About 9 to 17% of the fluoride brought into the oral cavity were not expectorated. For the mouthrinses containing 0.05% NaF the retention was about 0.4 mg F. This value is considered to be harmless. Mouthrinses used after the application of a monofluorophosphate-dentifrice helped to increase the relatively low oral fluid fluoride level. Rinsing with the test agents after brushing with the amine fluoride dentifrice (Elmex) produced no significantly increased fluoride levels. In-between meals eliminated the oral fluoride concentration rapidly.", "PMC3413672": "A case of third ventricular primary cerebral neuroblastoma with secondary hydrocephalus is reported.

Adult mongrel dogs were monitored by intra-arterial catheter, central venous catheter, and ECG, and by central venous, esophageal, and rectal temperature probes. Animals were externally cooled to an average of 21.2 C using ice bags. Eight Group 1 and eight Group 2 animals underwent continuous warm saline gastric or closed thoracic cavity lavage, respectively, using afferent and efferent nasogastric and thoracostomy tubes. No animal suffered ventricular fibrillation during tube placement. The closed lavage system consisted of a high-efficiency heat exchanger, a roller pump infusion device, and a heat exchange fluid bath. The lavage fluid circulated at a flow rate of 550 mL/min and a temperature of 39 C. Thoracic lavage animals were followed clinically for 24 hours for evidence of complications, then euthanized and autopsied. The mean time required to rewarm the animals 10 C by central venous temperature probe was 210.9 +/- 18.6 minutes for the gastric group and 99.3 +/- 23.0 minutes for the thoracic group (P less than .001). Rectal temperature consistently lagged behind central venous temperature during both the cooling and rewarming phases in both treatment groups. All of the thoracic lavage animals made an uneventful recovery. Continuous warm saline thoracic cavity lavage for core rewarming of severely hypothermic dogs is more effective than gastric lavage, and appears to be safe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3680861": "Strategy of protein determination in melanin containing samples was analyzed, and the prerequisites under which the Lowry procedure could be used were established. (a) Complete solubilization of proteins from melanosomes was not reached until the treatment with 3% sodium dodecylsulfate at 100 degrees C was prolonged to 5 h. (b) It is necessary to correct the data obtained with Folin reaction to eliminate melanin interference. (c) The correction is based upon the determination of the extent of solubilized melanin and subtraction of the corresponding Folin-Ciocalteu reaction values. (d) The extent of correction due to the melanin interference was found to be about 40% of the absorbance value.

The relationship between the increase of biliary flow induced by these drugs and the elimination of DDT was also evaluated. Phenobarbital (2.5 mg/ml) was fed to rats in their drinking water and chlordane (200 mg/kg) was added to the diet over a period of 3 days; oxytetracycline (200 mg/kg/day) was fed to rats orally for 8 days. After these treatments [14C]DDT was administered orally to anesthetized rats and then the bile was collected through cannulation of the bile duct. The data obtained show that phenobarbital and chlordane decrease zoxazolamine paralysis time and increase liver weight and biliary flow. Both drugs increase biliary excretion of [14C]DDT and decrease [14C]DDT levels in plasma; oxytetracycline increases zoxazolamine flow significantly. Oxytetracycline does not change biliary excretion of [14C]DDT but decreases the blood levels of the insecticide; and pretreatment of animals with phenobarbital, chlordane, and oxytetracycline does not significantly change [14C]DDT concentration in bile. These data demonstrate that the increased biliary excretion of DDT depends on the rate of bile elimination.", "PMC3871283": "The computed tomographic scans (CT) of 84 patients with untreated soft-tissue neoplasms were studied, 75 with primary and nine with secondary lesions. Each scan was evaluated using several criteria: homogeneity and density, presence and type of calcification, presence of bony destruction, involvement of multiple muscle groups, definition of adjacent fat, border definition, and vessel or nerve involvement. CT demonstrated the lesion in all 84 patients and showed excellent anatomic detail in 64 of the 75 patients with primary neoplasms. CT did not differentiate vessel or nerve entrapment from neurovascular structures that were simply applied to the pseudocapsule of the tumor. Blurring of adjacent fat was an infrequent finding, but when it was present, the tumor was malignant. The CT findings were characteristic enough to suggest the histology of the neoplasm in only 13 lesions (nine lipomas, three hemangiomas, one neurofibroma). No malignant neoplasm had CT characteristics specific enough to differentiate it from any other malignant tumor. However, malignant neoplasms could be differentiated from benign neoplasms in 88% of the cases.", "PMC3565168": "Simultaneous oral, rectal and axillary temperatures were measured in 73 elderly patients on a geriatric unit. Axillary and oral temperatures were significantly lower than rectal readings. If oral or axillary temperatures alone had been measured, pyrexia would have been missed in two thirds of patients with a rectal temperature of 37.5 degrees C or more, and about three quarters of those with a rectal temperature of 38 degrees C or more. These findings suggest that oral or axillary temperature measurements are inadequate screening tests for pyrexia in the elderly.", "PMC3163686": "We explored the potential proinflammatory effect of prostaglandins of the E series (PGE's) in a rabbit model of acute pulmonary inflammation. The instillation of fragments of the fifth component of complement (C5f) into the lung resulted in a localized area of inflammation, the extent of which was quantified by the total number of neutrophils and protein recoverable by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Utilizing 111In-labeled neutrophils and serial scintigraphy, neutrophil localization in the area of inflammation was detected as early as 20 min after C5f instillation and reached a maximum between 2 and 4 h. The simultaneous intrabronchial administration of 100 micrograms of PGE2 resulted in a twofold increase in the accumulation of neutrophils in the area of inflammation as determined scintigraphically, a fivefold increase in BAL neutrophils, and a threefold increase in BAL protein. A proinflammatory effect on lavage constituents was also seen with the intravenous administration of PGE2 (100 ng.kg-1.min-1) and PGE1 (50 ng.kg-1.min-1) as well as in animals pretreated with a PGH synthase inhibitor, meclofenamate, and a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, dazmegrel. The effect of intrabronchial PGE2 to potentiate the inflammatory response was attenuated by the intravenous administration of a vasoconstrictor (angiotensin II) and mimicked by a vasodilator (nitroprusside), suggesting an effect of vasodilation per se. Using radiolabeled microspheres, it was determined that in response to the C5f alone, there was a 50% decrease in local blood flow to the area of inflammation, a pattern different from that seen in the systemic circulation. This decrease was prevented by the concomitant administration of PGE2 or nitroprusside. We conclude that vasodilation induced by PGE2 is associated with enhancement of pulmonary inflammation.", "PMC3538738": "The content of insulin and C-peptide-like immunoreactivity (CPR) were determined in the tail of pancreas from 35 autopsied diabetic and 21 non-diabetic subjects. In the 28 diabetics who had been followed for more than 6 months, the relation between the amount of insulin or CPR in the pancreas and the stability of fasting serum glucose during diabetic life before death was analyzed together with the relation between the serum CPR response to the breakfast tolerance test before death and insulin content at autopsy. As an index of the instability of the blood sugar level, the standard deviation of the mean of 15 successive determinations of fasting serum glucose was used. Both insulin and CPR content in the pancreas were significantly decreased in diabetics as compared with non-diabetics. SD of the mean fasting serum glucose and insulin or CPR content in the tail of pancreas showed a significant inverse correlation on a logarithmic scale (P less than 0.01, r = -0.704 and P less than 0.01, gamma = -0.757, respectively). Serum CPR value during the breakfast tolerance test correlated significantly with the insulin content in the pancreas of diabetic subjects. These findings suggest that one of the causes of the instability of fasting serum glucose levels is the devastation of pancreatic beta-cells and that the pancreatic insulin content is logarithmically and inversely related to fluctuations in fasting serum glucose.", "PMC3541011": "Vascularized bone grafts are characterized by a viable cell population with osteogenic potential. These features suggest that continued growth can be anticipated following vascularized membranous bone transfer in a growing craniofacial skeleton. The present paper compares the potential for appositional bone growth in vascularized and free calvarial onlay bone grafts. In seven 8-week-old beagles, growth was assessed by direct caliper measurements of graft dimensions intraoperatively and 16 weeks postoperatively. Vascularized grafts demonstrated a 50 to 60 percent increase in size in all dimensions compared to 10 to 20 percent growth in free grafts (p less than 0.01). Microradiography revealed preservation of calvarial bony architecture and minimal resorption in vascularized grafts, while triple-fluorochrome labeling confirmed subperiosteal appositional bone formation. Free grafts were characterized by significant resorption and a delay in subperiosteal bone formation.", "PMC3224219": "Sensitivity of 7-day-old chick embryo ventricular heart fragments to acetylcholine was investigated. Low doses mainly produced a positive chronotropic effect, whereas high doses of acetylcholine provoked a decrease in the heart beat rhythm. The positive chronotropic effect of acetylcholine was related to the presence of nicotinic receptors that were evidenced within ventricular myocardium by autoradiography. Membrane potential recording showed that acetylcholine hyperpolarizes the diastolic membrane potential when the drug had a negative chronotropic effect. This effect of acetylcholine on the membrane potential was not observed when the drug had a positive chronotropic effect. In many cases, the diastolic membrane potential exhibited spontaneous small depolarizing potentials. Their amplitude was low and their frequency was irregular. These potentials were suppressed by treatment with alpha-bungarotoxin, suggesting that they are triggered by nicotinic receptor activation.", "PMC2843614": "The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance of venous malformations, all angiographically verified, was evaluated in 11 patients.

The hepatoprotective effect of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 on the deposition of collagen and fat was assessed by histological evaluation and measurement of hydroxyproline. Dose-response studies established that optimal protection was achieved by the twice daily administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 at 100 micrograms per kg (subcutaneous) or 250 micrograms per kg (oral). 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 and a crystalline analog [(p-acetamidobenzamido)phenyl ester of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 significantly delayed both the deposition of collagen and the increase in hepatic hydroxyproline content. There was an excellent correlation between the histological assessment of collagen and the biochemical measurement of hydroxyproline.

It was found that the differentiation of striated muscle fibres occurred abundantly in the pineal cells cultured in hypertonic culture conditions. Muscle nature of these fibres was confirmed by utilizing the antiserum against the striated muscle type creatine kinase (MM-CK). When CO2, NAHCO3, NaCl, KCl and MgCl2 were added in hypertonic concentrations, extensive myogenesis occurred in cultured pineal cells. Myogenesis in pineal cultures began as early as 2 days and, after 3 days in the medium with 75 mM additional NaCl, reached 100-fold when compared with that in the isotonic medium. Muscle fibres from pineal cells in culture were similar in morphology to the skeletal muscle fibres of mesodermal origin in situ. Myogenesis of pineal cells under hypertonic conditions was accompanied by the synthesis of a unique 56 x 10(3) Mr protein, which was not found in the intrinsic muscle cells. Clonal cell culture revealed that about 80% of clonable pineal cells were myogenic precursors. Pineal cells of 8-day quail embryos were not only myogenic but oculopotent (melanogenic and lentoidogenic) in cultures. This study examined whether multipotential progenitor cells with both potentials are present in the pineal or not. The results showed that at least 16% of all clonable pineal cells were multipotent precursors. The embryonic pineal is considered to be a typical multipotent system in parallel with the pigmented and neural retina, the neural crest and the teratocarcinoma.", "PMC2977985": "Effects of non lethal concentrations of hexavalent chromium on intestinal enzymology of Salmo gairdneri and Dicentrarchus labrax (Pisces). The effects of an exposure to potassium dichromate on intestinal enzyme activities (Alkaline phosphatase, maltase, leucine amino peptidase and ATPases) have been studied on a fresh water fish (Salmo gairdneri) and a salt water fish (Dicentrarchus labrax). Fish were exposed at seasonal temperatures (13 or 21 degrees C) to toxic concentrations equal to 1/10 of the 24 h-LC 50 (i.e. 18 mg/l Cr for trout and 5 mg/l Cr for bass) during respectively 13 and 21 days. Intoxicated trout stopped feeding and showed a decrease in their intestinal weight at the end of the experiments. A decrease of brush border membrane activities (Alkaline phosphatase, maltase and leucine amino peptidase) were also observed. These alterations have been interpreted as the consequence of the chromium induces fasting. Intoxicated bass showed no alterations of their feeding habits. Two specific effects of chromium on enzyme activities have been found: a severe decrease of the alkaline phosphatase activity and an increase of the Na/K ATPase activity. These enzyme activities could be useful indicators of chromium intoxication in marine fish.", "PMC2659701": "The purpose of this study carried out in Iranian Azerbaijan was to determine the pattern of skin-test positivity to mycobacterial antigens in children living in the valley, and to assess the effect on this of a series of vaccines against mycobacterial disease. Set up in 1978, 1707 tuberculin-negative children without scars of previous BCG vaccination were vaccinated with BCG Glaxo alone (vaccine A) or with the addition of a suspension of killed Mycobacterium vaccae (vaccine B). One hundred children were vaccinated with BCG Glaxo plus a suspension of M. leprae (vaccine C). Eight to 10 years later about half of the children were found for follow up. At this time further children were skin tested, and the results obtained were related to whether or not they had scars of vaccination with BCG Pasteur (Teheran) given by the local health authorities. Between setting up the study and the first follow up, cases of leprosy or tuberculosis had occurred in some of the villages, although not among those we had vaccinated. Differences between the effects of the vaccines were only found in villages with cases of leprosy. In these villages positivity to leprosin A was significantly greater after vaccine B (49%) than after vaccine A (36%; p less than 0.04). The results for scrofulin and vaccine were the same after both vaccines, and significantly lower than in the villages without cases of leprosy. The general reduction in skin-test positivity in the villages with leprosy cases was mainly due to a loss of category 1 responders to group i, common mycobacterial, antigens. It was concluded that where casual contact with cases of leprosy occurs the combination of BCG with killed M. vaccae is likely to be a better vaccine for leprosy than is BCG alone. Although few children received the combination with M. leprae, the results obtained were not particularly promising.", "PMC3916224": "The review deals with the phenomenology in the studies on characteristics of surface antigenic and immunogenic structures of Rickettsia, their cellular membranes, the processes of metabolic cooperation and interaction with the host cells, and the structure of Rickettsia genome.

In addition, solace is a significant subjective component of noninstinctual feelings such as love, joy, gratitude, and rapture. Pure solace is experienced primarily in relation to the sense of self, whereas the solace derivatives connect, in varying degrees, with objects external to the self. Psychiatrists see many patients who are unsolaceable and who, because of this, cannot experience sustained positive emotion of any kind. Those diagnosed as personality, conduct, and behaviorally disordered, as well as those with alexithymia, are particularly likely to exhibit a basic unsolaceability. The psychiatrist should also be alert to a deficiency of positive emotion in those with attention deficit disorder and the so-called learning disability syndrome. The coexistence of unsolaceability with features of right parietal cortex dysfunction suggests a directionality of positive emotional experience and parietal neocortical activity. The tertiary zones of the right parietal cortex appear to be the structural system most likely to subserve complex positive affects.", "PMC4021742": "The abnormal metabolism and distribution of plasma lipoproteins have been associated with atherosclerosis and gallstones. To better understand the process of cholesterol excretion, a study was designed to determine whether the contribution of lipoprotein free 14C-cholesterol (as LDL or HDL) to biliary cholesterol or primary bile acids differs in two species of nonhuman primates, cebus and cynomolgus monkeys, having opposite plasma LDL/HDL ratios. Since amino acid conjugation might influence bile acid synthesis or secretion, the taurine and glycine conjugates of newly synthesized primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), were measured in the species capable of conjugating with taurine or glycine (cynomolgus). After total bile acid pool washout, monkeys were infused with human LDL or HDL labeled with free 14C-cholesterol, and the specific activities (SA) of biliary cholesterol and primary bile acid conjugates were determined. In both species, regardless of the lipoprotein infused, the SA of biliary cholesterol and CA were greater than those for total bile acids and CDCA, respectively. In cynomolgus, the SA of glycine conjugates was higher for CA than CDCA, while the SA of taurine conjugates was greater for CDCA than CA. Under these conditions, (i) infused lipoprotein free cholesterol (as either LDL or HDL) contributed more to biliary cholesterol than to bile acids and more to CA than to CDCA; (ii) glycine conjugated preferentially with CA rather than CDCA, while taurine was the preferred conjugate for CDCA.", "PMC3965439": "Haloperidol was administered orally to 6 male schizophrenic patients and intravenously to 3.

Syphilis was of unknown duration (n = 27) or known duration of greater than one year (n = 20), and all patients had reactive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests and reactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption tests. Thirty-two per cent of subjects had abnormal CSF findings; these included elevated protein in nine (19%) of 47 and pleocytosis in six (13%) of 47. In most cases, the etiology of these abnormalities was uncertain. Asymptomatic neurosyphilis, diagnosed on the basis of a reactive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL; Atlanta, GA) test of CSF, was present in three (6%) of 47 patients. Of the eight patients with RPR titers of greater than or equal to 1:128, three (38%) had neurosyphilis.

As compared to the controls, a slightly significant increase in cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations was found only for the GN group, whereas the rate of cholesterol esterification showed a highly significant reduction in both groups of diseased subjects. The average values of molar esterification rate (MER) were, respectively, 75.4 and 61.6 mumol . l-1 . h-1 for the GN and PL groups, the respective control values being 96.9 and 91.1.

X-ray examination was done 1 month before and after the termination of gamma-beam radiotherapy, the summary focal doses varying from 40 to 75 Gy. The chief modes of lung examination were roentgenography and roentgenopneumopolygraphy. It was established that even before treatment the patients had latent signs of respiratory insufficiency. Radiotherapy, irrespective of the summary focal dose value, had a mediated effect on the lungs. One month after the discontinuation of radiotherapy the pulmonary pattern changed: its elements were enhanced and dilated, the general biomechanism of respiration impaired, particularly at the expense of reducing the respiratory mobility of the diaphragm and mediastinum, disorders of the bronchopulmonary ventilation increased.

The limited duration of action of the atropine derivatives currently available justifies the development of new compounds with expected longer acting duration. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a single blind intravenous injection of ipratropium bromide to those of atropine sulfate in 22 patients. These patients were studied with continuous Holter recordings for three days. During the second and the third nights (patient sleeping), boluses of atropine (0.03 mg/kg) and of ipratropium bromide (0.03 mg/kg), respectively, were added to a continuous saline intravenous infusion. Accurate ECG analysis allowed determination of maximal heart rate peak, timing of maximal heart rate, variations in sinus cycle length, atrioventricular conduction, and durations of drug action. A nonsuggestive questionnaire was presented to patients to detect possible occurrence of side effects. The mean maximal heart rate rose significantly (p less than 0.001) for atropine (+46.2%) and for ipratropium bromide (+57.4%). The effects obtained with ipratropium bromide on the heart rate lasted nearly twice as long as those obtained with atropine (respectively, 120 +/- 38.4 min and 70 +/- 30 min- for the pharmacological half-life). Common minor muscarinic side effects (dryness of the mouth) were noted with the two drugs.

Pieces of sympathetic ganglia containing thousands of neurons were plated onto culture dishes and allowed to extend neurites. Dendrites remained confined to the ganglionic explant or cell body mass (CBM), while axons extended away from the CBM for several millimeters. Axons were separated from cell bodies and dendrites by dissecting the CBM away from cultures, and the resulting axonal and CBM preparations were analyzed using biochemical, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation methods. Cultures were used after 17 d in vitro, when 40-60% of total protein was in the axons. The 68,000-mol-wt NF subunit is present in both axons and CBM in roughly equal amounts. The 145,000- and 200,000-mol-wt NF subunits each consist of several variants which differ in phosphorylation state; poorly and nonphosphorylated species are present only in the CBM, whereas more heavily phosphorylated forms are present in axons and, to a lesser extent, the CBM. One 145,000-mol-wt NF variant was axon specific. Tubulin is roughly equally distributed between CBM and axon-like neurites of explant cultures. MAP-1a, MAP-1b, MAP-3, and the 60,000-mol-wt MAP are also present in the CBM and axon-like neurites and show distribution patterns similar to that of tubulin. In contrast, MAP-2 was detected only in the CBM, while tau and the 210,000-mol-wt MAP were greatly enriched in axons compared to the CBM. In immunostaining analyses, MAP-2 localized to cell bodies and dendrite-like neurites, but not to axon-like neurites, whereas antibodies to tubulin and MAP-1b localized to all regions of the neurons. The regional differences in composition of the neuronal cytoskeleton presumably generate corresponding differences in its structure, which may, in turn, contribute to the morphological differences between axons and dendrites.", "PMC3530460": "Atherosclerosis is the most frequent cause of occlusion of aortocoronary saphenous vein grafts between 5 and 10 years after coronary artery bypass surgery. The typical atherosclerotic plaque appears between 1 and 3 years after operation and, at a mean of 5 years, histologic changes of atherosclerosis are present in 21% of grafts and in 27% of patients. Only approximately 60% of saphenous vein grafts remain patent at repeat angiography between 10 and 12 years after bypass surgery; 45% of patent grafts show atherosclerotic changes at angiography and 43% of patients show evidence of atherosclerosis in one or more saphenous vein grafts. We do not know whether the development or the progression of these atherosclerotic changes can be modified; however, the data currently available suggest that the administration of platelet inhibitors and/or of lipid lowering agents offer two promising avenues of investigation in patients undergoing aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass surgery.

Number of cases evaluated for clinical efficacy were 154 cases (73 treated with TMS and 81 treated with JM). The effective rating of TMS and JM were 89.0% and 88.9% judged by doctors in charge, and 82.2% and 85.2% judged by committee respectively. Bacteriological effects were satisfactory to yield the eradication rates of 93.8% in TMS and 94.7% in JM. Number of cases evaluated for safety were 199 cases (101 treated with TMS and 98 treated with JM). The incidence of side effect was 4.0% (4/101) in TMS and 5.1% (5/98) in JM and most of them were mild gastro-intestinal disorders. Number of cases evaluated for utility were 156 cases (74 treated with TMS and 82 treated with JM). The usefulness rates were 85.1% in TMS and 86.6% in JM.

Hens with feed withheld for the first 8 hr (0400 to 1200 hr) of the 16-hr light cycle showed no decline in shell quality, but those with feed withheld the last 8 hr (1200 to 2000 hr) had poorer shell quality on the following day. When the period from 1200 to 2000 hr was divided into 2 periods (1200 to 1600 hr and 1600 to 2000 hr), feed restriction during the 1600 to 2000-hr period caused a decline in shell quality on the next day, but removal during the 1200 to 1600-hr period had no effect on shell quality. Shell quality was related to the feed intake of the hens, because about 34% of their feed intake was during the period 1600 to 2000 hr. Hens fed a low Ca diet (.7%) from 1200 to 2000 hr had poorer shell quality but not as poor as those with feed withheld. Feeding a high Ca diet (7.6%) from 0400 to 1200 hr prior to feed restriction from 1200 to 2000 hr, or giving oyster shell during the period of feed removal, improved shell quality, but not to the level of the full-fed birds. Daily feed restriction from 1200 to 2000 hr caused a reduction in shell quality for the first 4 days after which shell quality returned, but a slight decline in egg production was noted.

Of these, 98 (35.8%) had heavy Echinococcus worm burdens (10(3)-5 X 10(4) ), while 54 (19.7%) and 122 (44.5%) had medium (201-1000) and light (1-200) burdens. The possible sources of these infections are discussed. The prevalence rate differed in various parts of the district, ranging from 63.5% in the northwest, where the highest incidence of human hydatidosis also occurs, to nil along the shores of Lake Turkana. Infection rates of 32.0% and 16.7% were recorded at Lokitaung (north-east) and Lodwar (central), while in the south 48.9% of dogs harboured Echinococcus. This latter figure is surprising as the area has a low incidence of human hydatidosis. The Turkana keep a large number of dogs, and the reasons for this and the social role of the dog in the district is discussed. No difference in susceptibility was found between Turkana-type dogs and those of mixed breeds from Nairobi when they were experimentally infected with hydatid protoscolices from man, camels, cattle, sheep and goats. However, it proved difficult to infect the Turkana-type of dogs with viable protoscolices of cattle origin. The reasons for this and its epidemiological implications remain unclear. It is suggested that droughts, which affect Turkana every six to ten years, may play an important role in the perpetuation of hydatid disease in the area.", "PMC1356527": "In a modified, double-blind controlled study, 163 prepubertal boys (aged 1.8-13.0 years) with bilateral and 94 (aged 1.5-13.1 years) with unilateral cryptorchidism were allocated to treatment with either human chorionic gonadotrophin (im), gonadotrophin releasing hormone (intranasally) or placebo (intranasally). In individuals with the bilateral condition treatment with human chorionic gonadotrophin resulted in complete descent of both testes in 23% of patients. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotrophin in unilateral cryptorchidism resulted in complete descent in 19% of patients; all results were significantly better than those obtained with gonadotrophin releasing hormone or placebo. Linear and logistic regression analysis of the results obtained by treatment of bilateral disease showed that all treatments were more successful the younger the age of the boys. The data indicated that bilateral and unilateral cryptorchidism respond differently to hormonal treatment. We suggest that human chorionic gonadotrophin should be the first choice of treatment for prepubertal boys older than one year.", "PMC4058246": "Previous studies have indicated that the thiazide diuretics exert effects on proximal electrolyte transport. To determine whether the locus of these effects is at the brush border membrane (BBM) and if renal metabolism is affected, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were acutely treated with either 1 mg/kg metolazone, 20 mg/kg chlorothiazide followed by a 20 mg/kg/hr maintenance infusion, 10 mg/kg acetazolamide followed by a 10 mg/kg/hr maintenance infusion, or the vehicles only. Administration of these agents resulted in an approximately tenfold increase in sodium excretion. Neither urinary phosphate nor inulin excretion changed significantly in any group. Sodium dependent BBM vesicle phosphate transport was examined at 0.15, 0.5, and 1 and 120 minute incubation periods in the diuretic treated groups and their respective control groups. Decreased uptake was seen in all pre-equilibrium time points in rats treated with metolazone: 0.15 minutes: 221 +/- 24 pmoles/mg protein (pmol/mg prot) in control rats versus (vs) 185 +/- 23 pmoles/mg prot in metolazone-treated animals (P less than .05) ; 0.5 minutes: 463 +/- 54 vs 369 +/- 49 pmol/mg prot (P less than .005); 1 minute: 549 +/- 74 vs 460 +/- 61 pmol/mg prot (P less than .05); no significant difference in phosphate transport was noted at the two hour equilibrium time point. No significant differences in sodium dependent phosphate transport existed between chlorothiazide or acetazolamide treated rats and control animals. Substrate-stimulated renal gluconeogenesis did not differ between metolazone treated and control animals. We therefore conclude that metolazone inhibits phosphate transport through an effect on the BBM and does not affect renal gluconeogenesis in the rat.", "PMC4090537": "Wood dust is known as a cause of asthma and chronic bronchitis.

The age of the donor mice varied from embryonic day 13 to the day of birth, and the recipient rats from the day of birth up to 2 days. After survival times of from 5 weeks to 1 year the recipient brains were histologically processed for the tracing of host-xenograft connections by silver staining and electron microscopy of anterograde degeneration, AChE histochemistry, immunohistochemical demonstration of the neuropeptides CCK and enkephalin, and the histochemical Timm sulphide silver method, as well as stained by ordinary cell and fiber stains. The survival of the xenografts depended on the donor age, with less than 10% survival for newborn donors and 60-69% for E13-16 donors. The surviving xenografts developed an organotypic organization and retained a mouse-specific CCK-reactivity in the associational hilodentate system and the dentate mossy fibers. Judged by their positive AChE histochemistry most xenografts received a host rat cholinergic projection when placed in normal cholinoreceptive areas, including areas outside the normal reach of the septo-hippocampal system like the neocortex. Xenografts encroaching on the trajectory of the host rat commissural and perforant path projections or their terminal fields in fascia dentata received laminar and neuropeptide specific host projections. Electron microscopy of host rat perforant path fibers traced to the xenograft dentate molecular layer confirmed the laminar distribution and revealed numerous asymmetric synaptic contacts with spines. An efferent xenograft projection of CCK-reactive mouse mossy fibers into the host CA3 mossy fiber layer demonstrated that this cross-species, mouse to rat innervation also applied to the normal developmental rules, despite the, for the rat abnormal, CCK-content.

Varying degrees of hypothyroidism were achieved in thyroparathyroidectomized rats (THYREX) by continuous sc infusion of T3 (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 microgram/100 g X day) or T4 (0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 microgram/100 g X day). While T3 was more potent than T4, both resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of the post-thyroidectomy rise in TSH. After 7 or 14 days of severe hypothyroidism (nonreplaced THYREX rats) the pituitary TSH secretory response to TRH (250 ng/100 g body weight, iv) was found to be decreased when compared to that of euthyroid rats. Decreasing the degree of hypothyroidism increased the pituitary secretory response to TRH and the pituitary TSH content. The results indicate that in the hypothyroid rat: severe hypothyroidism results in a blunted pituitary TSH response to TRH through 14 days after thyroidectomy, at 7 and 14 days after thyroidectomy the pituitary TSH response to exogenous TRH is inversely related to the basal plasma TSH concentration, the pituitary TSH concentration increases with the duration of hypothyroidism, the pituitary TSH content is increased by low rates of thyroid hormone replacement, and the pituitary TSH response to exogenous TRH is directly related to the pituitary TSH content.", "PMC2891700": "Thylakoid membranes contain sequestered domains in which protons are held in a metastable state out of equilibrium with those in the inner (lumen) or the outer aqueous bulk phases unless the membranes are made leaky by, for instance, the addition of uncouplers. Previously, it has not been clear whether such sequestered domain protons are: 1) directly on a localized pathway into the CF0-CF1; 2) on an ultimately delocalized pathway comprising domains----lumen----CF0-CF1; or 3) perhaps not importantly involved in any way with proton gradient-linked ATP formation. Recent developments now permit a test of the above possibilities. The test for the possible mode of involvement of domain protons in energy coupling utilized single turnover flashes to energize electric field-driven ATP formation, as influenced by both the proton depletion level of the sequestered domains and whether the thylakoids were prepared in a way to show either a localized or delocalized proton gradient response in ATP formation (this response is reversibly controlled by incubation in low (localized coupling mode) or high KCl (delocalized mode) incubations (Beard, W. A., and Dilley, R. A. (1986) FEBS Lett. 201, 57-62; Chiang, G. and Dilley, R. A. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 4911-1916). Using thylakoids showing delocalized coupling responses, there was no influence of the reversible depletion of the sequestered domain buffering pool on the delta psi-driven ATP formation onset lag. Lumenal protons rather than domain protons in that case appear to be the first to be driven through the CF0-CF1 complex by the delta psi field. However, using thylakoids prepared to be in the localized gradient coupling mode, protons in the domains, rather than those in the lumen, are the first to pass through the CF0-CF1 complex in the onset of energization. We conclude that the sequestered domain protons, in the latter case only, are obligatorily in the main proton diffusion pathway for energization of ATP formation and are the first protons (rather than lumen protons) driven through the CF1-CF0 complex by a delta psi field.", "PMC3547791": "Rat livers were flushed with isotonic citrate solution (IC), hypertonic citrate solution (HC), or Collins' solution (C2), and were stored at 0 degree C for 8-16 hr. Following 8-hr preservation, the number of animals surviving for one month was greatest with IC grafts (6/8) and least with C2 grafts (2/7). There was no significant difference between the two citrate groups. Following 12-hr preservation, the IC group was superior to the HC group (3/6 vs. 1/6). Following 16-hr preservation, all four animals in each citrate group died within 24 hr. The ability of livers to produce bile was greater in the citrate groups, compared with the C2 group. A bile flow rate less than 0.3 microliter/min/g liver, 15 min after implantation, appeared to predict subsequent poor survival. There were no significant histological differences between biopsies taken from each group at the end of the transplant operation. Biochemical measures of liver function were best in animals that had received IC grafts, and functional damage after preservation was consistently greater in the C2 group than the citrate groups.

Moreover brain myelin was isolated and purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The results obtained confirm that, in the rat brain, the enzymes involved in testosterone 5 alpha-reduction are preferentially localized in the white matter. However, clearcut differences in the metabolic activity exist between the different structures examined so far. DHT formation increases rostro-caudally, so that the highest activity has been recorded in the white matter structures punched at the level of pons (FP), medulla oblungata (TCS) and cerebellum (CMD). The high metabolic activity associated with the white matter structures appears to be linked to the presence of myelin, since the specific activity of the enzyme is particularly elevated in purified preparations of myelin sheaths.", "PMC3608666": "In this study, the impact of rejection/acceptance experienced during the adolescent mother's childhood, social support received after the baby's birth, and infant irritability on angry, punitive maternal behavior are tested, and possible links between such maternal behavior and indices of child anger and noncompliance, low confidence, and social withdrawal are investigated. 40 mothers who gave birth as adolescents and their 2-year-old children participated in the study. When mothers experienced both rejection during childhood and little support from a partner after birth, they were likely to exhibit angry and punitive parenting. Infant irritability did not predict maternal behavior. Angry and punitive mothers had children who were angry and noncompliant and who distanced themselves from their mothers. Taken as a main effect, infant irritability was unrelated to later child behavior. However, the association between maternal behavior and 2 aspects of child behavior was stronger for children as irritable at 3 months postpartum: when irritable infants had angry and punitive mothers they were more likely to be angry and noncompliant and to exhibit less confidence than less irritable infants who experienced the same pattern of parenting.", "PMC2808146": "Electroneural response patterns of single auditory-nerve neurons were studied in aminoglycoside-deafened squirrel monkeys. The electrical stimuli were delivered through bipolar electrodes implanted in the scala tympani. The effects of pulse width, shape, frequency, and intensity on neural adaptation, phase locking, and spectral content were evaluated. Our results did not demonstrate the characteristic adaptation seen in auditory-nerve neurons in response to acoustic stimulation. Phase locking to a broad stimulus pulse (3200 microseconds/phase) was found to a very restricted phase angle of the electrical stimulus which was broader for square wave than for sine wave stimulation. The latency of the phase locked response varied inversely with stimulus intensity with greater variation for square wave stimulation than for sine wave stimulation. Auditory neurons were capable of a very high degree of phase locking to a 200-microseconds/phase pulse presented at 156 pulses per second (PPS) and to the first pulse of a 2500-Hz pulse burst. Phase locking was much poorer for the subsequent 200-microseconds/phase pulses comprising the 2500-Hz pulse burst where the neuron's response was determined by its relative recovery status. These findings can be explained by an interaction between the neuron's relative refractory status and its integration of charge over the stimulatory half cycle of the electrical stimulus. These two factors also appear to determine the interspike interval of the neural response. This interval decreased monotonically with increasing stimulus intensity. The neural spike rate (150-500 Hz) producing this interval increased with intensity and may be a source of periodicity information which the central auditory nervous system could interpret as pitch. This may account for the proportional relationship between pitch and stimulus intensity seen in some cochlear implant patients. Our study demonstrates that auditory-nerve neurons comply with basic neurophysiological principles in their responses to electrical stimulation. These principles should be incorporated into the cochlear prosthesis stimulator if more normal neural response patterns are desired in the cochlear prosthesis patient.", "PMC3983400": "High molecular weight antigen (HMWA) is a tumor-associated proteoglycan of human malignant melanoma. I-131 labeled Fab fragments of these specific antibodies were used for preliminary feasibility studies for radioimmunodetection and therapy of human subjects who had inoperable metastatic melanoma. Ten patients received tracer doses of 5-13 mCi (185-481 MBq) of I-131 (anti-HMWA) Fab. All patients (8/8) who had melanoma lesions greater than 1 cm by correlative diagnostic methods had one or more lesions that had localization to tumor of the radiolabeled Fab. In all, 17 of 23 (74%) documented metastases were seen. There were no false positives in this series. Two patients who had avid uptake received potentially radiotherapeutic doses of 142 mCi (5,254 MBq) (one patient) and 181 mCi (6,697 MBq) and 193 (7,141 MBq) (total: 374 mCi or 13,838 MBq) (one patient). For both of these patients, whole body imaging studies showed that the localization of the high dose I-131 Fab was predominantly in tumor. The patient who received the larger dose showed a greater than 50% reduction in the size of pelvic and pericaval nodes, with stabilization of disease at the smaller nodal size for a period of three months. On whole body images, the anti-Fab HMWA appears to be more tumor selective than Fab preparations that target the p97 antigen for melanoma, and there is less uptake in liver.", "PMC3303485": "Enteric pathogens were studied in 104 cases with acute diarrhoea and in 74 age and sex matched concurrent controls. One or more pathogens were isolated from 59.1% of cases compared with 20.4% of controls (P less than 0.001). Single enteropathogens were detected in 33.7% and multiple enteropathogens in 25.4% of the cases. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Campylobacter jejuni, rotavirus, Vibrio cholerae non-O1 and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were the major pathogens detected. The high rate of isolation of EPEC from diarrhoea cases (23.1%) indicated a definite role for this pathogen in causing endemic diarrhoea in Bangladesh.", "PMC3293911": "The genes coding for the enzymes involved in methionine biosynthesis and regulation are scattered on the Escherichia coli chromosome. All of them have been cloned and most have been sequenced. From the information gathered, one can establish the existence (upstream of the structural genes coding for the biosynthetic genes and the regulatory gene) of \"methionine boxes\" consisting of two or more repeats of an octanucleotide sequence pattern. The comparison of these sequences allows the extraction of a consensus operator sequence. Mutations in these sequences lead to the constitutivity of the vicinal structural gene. The operator sequence is the target of a DNA-binding protein--the methionine aporepressor--which has been obtained in the pure state, for which S-adenosylmethionine acts as the corepressor. Mutations in the corresponding gene lead to the constitutive expression of all the methionine structural genes. The physicochemical properties of the methionine aporepressor are being investigated.", "PMC3678130": "Dynamics of the content of 3-OAK-A in the liver, blood and urine as well as of free and bound AK in the liver of rats and mice was traced by the quantitative precipitation reaction and oxidimetric method of ascorbic acid (AA) determination. It was shown that an increase in the content of 3-OAK-A in the liver during carcinogenesis initiation and progression is accompanied by a decrease in the AA content in this organ. One of the possible mechanisms inhibiting the formation of 3-OAK-A is \"interception\" of the proteins involved in the formation of 3-OAK-A.", "PMC3013563": "A selected series of nucleoside analogues were tested for inhibitory activity vs DNA and/or RNA synthesis at L1210 cells. The structure-activity relationship was studied among derivatives of 5-fluorouracil and arabinosylcytosine (araC), compounds clinically used in cancer chemotherapy. 5-Fluorouridine was found to be a selective, most potent inhibitor of RNA synthesis. Arabinosylcytosine was the most potent selective inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Only cyclocytidine stands very close to the carcinostatic antibiotics in its strong simultaneous inhibition of both DNA and RNA synthesis. A biologically interesting new group of 5'-deoxy derivatives of arabinosylcytosine was investigated. The inhibitory activity vs DNA and/or RNA synthesis is compared with the activity against growth of E. coli and against herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). The system for inhibition of NA synthesis is proposed as a preliminary first step: an in vitro screening method promising for the discovery of new types of potential carcinostatic agents. Both transport and biotransformation processes of nucleoside analogues were studied in the isolated everted rat jejunum with a continuous perfusion technique. The 5'-substituted derivatives of araC and 5'-chloro-5-fluorouridine exhibited higher transport rates and higher metabolic stability during intestinal penetration than the parent nucleosides. There was found to be no correlation between lipophilicity and transport rate, but there is a correlation between lipophilicity and metabolic alterations among the nucleoside derivatives studied.", "PMC3522735": "The cytosolic concentration, Mr, and isoforms of cyclophilin (CyP), a specific cytosolic binding protein for cyclosporin A (CsA), were determined in normal and neoplastic human tissues as well as tissues from species of diverse phylogeny. CyP was present in all tissues examined; however, concentrations varied significantly among different tissue types. The CyP concentration was highest in lymphoblasts from a patient with T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (1.15 micrograms/mg protein) and Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. CyP concentration in colon adenocarcinomas was twofold to threefold greater than that found in adjacent normal tissue. CyP from all normal and neoplastic human tissues examined had an apparent Mr of 17,000 determined by gel filtration HPLC. Major (pI 8.6 to 8.7) and minor (pI 6.7 to 6.9) CyP isoforms were identified in all human and murine tissue extracts by column sucrose gradient isoelectrofocusing; however, the ratio of the major to minor isoform varied widely. Among other species examined, significant concentrations of CyP were detected in cytosol extracts from sponges (Microciona prolifera), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), mushrooms, the giant cockroach (Blaberus discoidalis), and a trematode (Schistosoma mansoni). By contrast, CyP was not detectable in extracts of Escherichia coli. A twofold to threefold elevation in the CyP content of murine splenocytes was detected 72 hr after Con A stimulation. A survey of a variety of natural products, synthetic compounds, and immunoregulating agents has failed thus far to identify compounds capable of competing with CsA for binding to CyP. The broad tissue and phylogenetic distribution of CyP, its highly conserved structure, and its increased content after mitogenic stimulation suggest a fundamental role in cellular metabolism.", "PMC2636583": "The lung functions were evaluated in eighteen patients of ulcerative colitis, in a controlled study. There was statistically significant (p less than 0.01) reduction in maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). Diffusing capacity (DLCo) was also reduced. Though the reduction in DLCo was not statistically significant, the importance of this finding as compared to the controls has been discussed. The findings are suggestive of subclinical restrictive ventilatory abnormality.", "PMC3991679": "An approach based on graph theoretical methods for searching the most potent drug among numerous candidate structures is outlined. First, we identify the strategic fragment and describe it by suitable graph theoretical invariants. We have adopted path numbers derived from suitably weighted bonds as basic invariants. Similarity among structures is quantitatively derived from similarity and differences in atomic path numbers for the strategic fragment. The approach is illustrated on a selection of antitumor phenyldialkyltriazenes for which log(1/C) are known. By starting the search with an unsubstituted parent compound, in few steps we located 1-(4-NHCOCH3-Phenyl)-3,3-dialkyltriazene as the most potent drug among those considered.", "PMC3220680": "The effects of strict blood glucose control on total skin blood flow and capillary blood flow velocity in finger nailfold capillaries were assessed in nine diabetics. Measurements were made before (blood glucose: 11.2 +/- 0.8 mmol/l) and after nine days of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (blood glucose 6.2 +/- 0.8 mmol/l, p less than 0.001). Resting finger skin blood flow, measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, was 18.6 +/- 2.7 ml/100 ml tissue/min before and 12.6 +/- 2.7 ml/100 ml/min (ns) after CSII. Nailfold capillary red cell velocity, measured by television video microscopy, rose significantly from 0.36 +/- 0.09 mm/s before to 0.71 +/- 0.14 mm/s (p less than 0.01) after CSII. Venous oxygen tension, measured in samples of blood taken from an antecubital vein, tended to fall after CSII (from 6.1 +/- 0.4 kPa to 4.6 +/- 0.5 kPa/ns). No change was seen in whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity or red cell filtration rate during the study although heart rate fell from 81.3 +/- 2.0 to 75.2 +/- 1.7 beats/min (p less than 0.02). The results suggest that there is a redistribution of skin blood flow following improved diabetic control which favours the nutritive microcirculation.", "PMC1127110": "Eight strains of Pseudomonas putrefaciens have been received from among 466 strains of Pseudomonas submitted to the Computer Trials Laboratory for identification over the last eight years. Two of the strains of P. putrefaciens from patients with otitis media and otitis externa respectively appear to have played a pathogenic role. The biochemical characteristics of these eight strains were compared with those of seven culture collection strains.", "PMC3558449": "The influence of nitrogen-ion implantation on the wear-accelerated corrosion behavior of surgical Ti-6Al-4V was studied. Nonpassivated and prepassivated unimplanted Ti-6Al-4V specimens were employed as controls for comparison. Corrosion rates as a function of time at open-circuit corrosion potentials were electrochemically measured in saline and serum solutions under both static and wear conditions. The wear parameters simulated those of a total artificial hip under average walking conditions. The results indicated that prepassivation of the control material was beneficial under static-corrosion conditions, but not under wear-corrosion conditions. The nitrogen-ion implantation process was found to significantly improve the material's resistance to wear-accelerated corrosion in both saline and serum solutions.", "PMC3601072": "Neurons in the central nervous system of mammals and many other species receive most of their synaptic inputs in their dendritic branches and spines, but the precise manner in which this information is processed in the dendrites is not understood. In order to gain insight into these mechanisms, simulations of interactions between distal dendritic spines with an excitable membrane have been carried out, using an electrical circuit analysis program for the compartmental representation of a dendrite and several spines. Interactions between responses to single and paired excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs have been analyzed. Basic logic operations, including AND gates, OR gates and AND-NOT gates, arise from these interactions. The results suggest the computational power and precision of excitable spines in distal branches of neuronal dendrites, especially those of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex. The applicability to information processing in distal dendrites is discussed.", "PMC3877348": "During the past 6 years, 25 consecutive patients with esophageal variceal hemorrhage were treated by esophageal endosclerosis (direct injection of varices with a sclerosing agent). The primary disease in the 25 children was portal vein thrombosis (11 patients), biliary atresia (nine patients), and hepatic cirrhosis from cystic fibrosis (three patients), alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (one patient), and neonatal hepatitis (one patient). Thirteen patients were treated during acute, major variceal hemorrhage. Esophageal endosclerosis was repeated at regular intervals until all esophageal varices were obliterated. Twenty-one patients completed therapy. Four patients died: one of a complication of therapy and three of the primary disease. Other than the one death, complications were minor. Recurrent esophageal variceal hemorrhage has not been encountered in follow-up from 9 months to 6 years after completion of therapy.", "PMC2914490": "An original method of treatment for main bronchus fistula occurring after pneumonectomy was described in 1961. The operation is performed via a median sternotomy and the carinal region exposed. The main bronchi can then be divided in an area not involved with infection. We describe ten patients who underwent this procedure. The left bronchus was divided in seven patients and the right in three. Nine patients were long-term survivors, and one patient died in the early postoperative period from myocardial infarction. The transmediastinal approach for the control of bronchopleural fistula seems an effective means of managing this difficult postoperative problem.", "PMC3695986": "The ability of S. bovis 83/5364, glucan-positive (biotype I) and S. bovis R 81/536 glucan-negative (biotype II) to adhere to buccal epithelial cells (BEC) by lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was examined. LTA from both biotypes was prepared by cold phenol extraction from supernatants of penicillin supplemented cultures and partially purified by Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. Both glucan-positive and glucan-negative S. bovis strains adhered to BEC, but biotype I seemed to be more adhesive. For both biotypes the adhesion was not significantly inhibited by treatment of the bacteria with anti-LTA serum, while the preincubation of BEC with LTA, extracted from S. agalactiae, or cardiolipin strongly decreased the S. bovis binding.", "PMC3766703": "During the growth of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon neoplasms in mice from microscopic ones at 9 weeks to macroscopic, invasive ones at 25-26 weeks after the initiation of DMH treatments, the neoplastic glands became increasingly but variably elongated and tortuous, with epithelial evaginations and/or invaginations. For assessment of the mode of growth and genesis of heterogeneity of neoplasms, colon neoplasms induced by two different cumulative doses of DMH were compared at 25-26 weeks after the initial DMH injection. At this time they invaded the colonic wall similarly in depth. However, neoplasms that developed in mice given a higher cumulative dose of DMH had a more homogeneous cell population, a higher proliferative activity, and more apoptotic bodies than those with a lower dose. By 73 hours after multiple tritiated thymidine injections, most neoplastic cells became labeled. There were numerous foci of unlabeled cells seen among, or alternating with, areas of labeled cells. Epithelial evaginations into the glandular lumen consisted of proliferating cells and/or differentiated cells; whereas invaginations into the lamina propria contained only proliferating cells. These findings suggest a compartmentalization of neoplastic glands into multiple neoplastic clonogenic units during growth, from which cellular heterogeneity and architectural complexities of neoplastic glands develop.", "PMC3438964": "Ureterosciatic herniation is probably not as uncommon as a literature review would suggest. It rarely produces symptoms and is usually an incidental finding on urogram. The posterior position of the ureter passing beyond the medial wall of the bony pelvis is easily detected on intravenous urography with ipsilateral oblique films and can be confirmed tomographically. This ectopic course of the ureter can be depicted clearly on pelvic computed tomograms.", "PMC3861046": "A case of nodular fasciitis diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology is described.

Nodules were identified in foetuses from nine months gestational age, and estimates of total and regional nodule populations were made in foetal, neonatal and adult horses. Nodules occurred at specific sites within the tract, which probably relate to areas where inhaled antigens accumulate. The largest populations of nodules occurred in the nasopharynx and larynx, with smaller numbers in the nasal cavity, trachea and bronchi. There was an age-related change in the size of these nodule populations, with an increase in number from late gestation to the neonatal period to early adulthood (up to 5 years of age), followed by a decrease in older adults.", "PMC2952862": "To further study the relationship between ventilatory response (VR) and exercise performance, and to investigate to what extent progesterone is responsible for ventilatory changes in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, we administered medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to 10 normal males (20 mg three times a day for 5 doses) and compared results with those obtained in a similar study of females. With MPA, there was an increase in the resting VR to hypercapnia; the resting VR to hypoxia was not changed. There was a respiratory alkalosis at rest. During exercise, the PaCO2 remained lower but the pHa was not different because of a tendency toward lower bicarbonate concentration with MPA. Ventilation, when related to CO2 output, was increased at all exercise loads, indicating increased VR to endogenous CO2. However, ventilation was only minimally (3%) increased when related to oxygen uptake or workload. This apparent disparity is because of slightly lower CO2 output at a given oxygen uptake with MPA. As in females, maximal duration of exercise and maximal oxygen uptake were unchanged. Except for degree, MPA induced all the ventilatory changes seen in the menstrual cycle. Increased VR does not adversely affect exercise performance.", "PMC4016585": "The results of gross and histopathological study of a near-term male hamster exencephalic lateral cephalothoracopagus are presented. There was minimal duplication of the internal organs to the point of division at the abdomen. The appendicular skeleton was relatively unaffected by the severe malformations of the axial skeleton. The studies suggested that the lateral relationship of the skull to the spinal columns was a consequence of the presence of two embryonic neural tubes; the chordomesodermal systems of the right and left twins apparently contributed the tissues for the right and left cephalic neural folds, respectively. Anomalies of the vertebral bodies and neural arches were not related to failure of closure of the neural tube as there was no evidence for rachischisis in either body half. Rather, the anomalous axial skeletal elements were apparently the result of competing fields of development by two chordomesodermal systems. The twins were recovered from a dam maintained on a diet consisting of 80% cassava, a cyanide-containing staple consumed by humans in tropical countries. Because the numbers of resorbed implantation sites and malformed litermates were low and the failure to produce conjoined twins in other litters recovered from dams given cassava diets, it appears unlikely that the malformation was related to the composition of the diet.", "PMC3591293": "Between 1981 and 1983, 49 children aged 2 to 15 years were diagnosed as having idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH). They were divided into 3 groups based on their response to dietary manipulation: group I (32/49) had absorptive hypercalciuria; group II (8/49) had renal hypercalciuria and group III (6/49) had sodium-dependent hypercalciuria. Response to diet was more reliable than Pak's test in differentiating between the three groups. A control group (CG) of 45 healthy, age matched children determined baseline levels for all metabolic parameters. At the time of presentation IH children did not differ from the CG in height or weight. Fifty percent of IH children had first degree relatives with urolithiasis. Yet, only 16% of the IH children had urolithiasis, the majority presenting with gross hematuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). With few exceptions the clinical symptoms resolved when urine calcium excretion was controlled. Severe calcium restriction in a few patients produced osteoporosis and delayed bone age although growth velocity was unaffected. Thiazide therapy in a few patients produced some metabolic derangements. The authors conclude that IH in childhood is a benign disease which may present with UTI or hematuria. They further propose a new classification method based on response to dietary manipulation.", "PMC2705517": "Swelling of human red cells activates a putative K-Cl cotransport that is not present at normal cell volume and that disappears after several hours. To determine whether regulatory volume decrease (RVD) is occurring in human erythrocytes and is responsible for the inactivation of K-Cl cotransport, the relationship between cell volume and the inactivation and reactivation of volume-sensitive (VS) K-Cl cotransport was studied. VS K influx into high K cells was transient, whereas influx into low K cells (prepared with nystatin), which are unable to shrink via K efflux, remained fully activated. Likewise, VS K efflux into hypotonic medium disappeared after 100 min in a low K medium but remained activated in a high K medium that prevented cell shrinkage. Cells that had been preincubated in hypotonic medium to inactivate VS K-Cl cotransport showed no significant recovery of VS cotransport after a 6-h incubation in isotonic medium but showed full restoration of VS cotransport after treatment with nystatin in isotonic medium to reequilibrate cell water. A pure fraction of volume-regulating (VR) cells was subsequently isolated by preincubating red cells in hypotonic medium and then subjecting them to further hypotonicity to lyse all non-VR cells. The 2.5% of cells that remained consisted of 16% reticulocytes and exhibited a Cl-dependent RVD in hypotonic medium. VS K-Cl cotransport was enriched 10-fold and Na-K-Cl cotransport was enriched 12-fold in these cells, whereas the enrichment of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-activated K-Cl cotransport was only threefold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3338546": "The effect of the sodium ionophore monensin on the vitelline cells of Fasciola hepatica has been determined both in vitro and in vivo by means of transmission electron microscopy. In intact flukes in vitro, vacuolation of the Golgi complex of the intermediate, shell protein secreting vitelline cells is evident after 1.5 hr incubation in monensin (1 X 10(-6) M). The vacuolation becomes progressively greater with time, eventually spreading to the late stem cells and mature cells. In addition, there is a block in the normal migration of the shell protein globules to the periphery, the shell globule clusters becoming very loosely packed and empty, and distended single globules accumulate in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disruption of the nurse cell cytoplasm is apparent from 6 hr onwards, giving the follicle a less compact appearance. Morphological changes induced by higher concentrations of monensin (up to 1 X 10(-4) M) followed a similar time course and pattern to that described for 1 X 10(-6) M) followed a similar time course and pattern to that described for 1 X 10(-6) M. In tissue-slice material (1 X 10(-6) M) these effects of monensin are evident more rapidly, and to a far greater extent: the condition of the vitelline cells in slices after only 1.5 hr resembles that reached in intact flukes after more than a 12-hr incubation. Incubation in ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase activity, has little effect on vitelline morphology over a 6-hr period (1 X 10(-3) M), although brief (0.5 hr) exposure to ouabain followed by monensin treatment (1 X 10(-4) M, 3 hr) does lead to gross vacuolation of the intermediate cells, the condition resembling that in tissue-slice material. In contrast, in vivo treatment of infected laboratory rats (1 X 5 mg/kg) only leads to a transient effect on the ultrastructure of the intermediate vitelline and nurse cells. The specific perturbation of the Golgi complex and secretory traffic in the vitelline cells of F. hepatica by monensin follows the classic pattern observed in other cell types.", "PMC3964301": "When skin fibroblasts are grown in culture on collagen gels, the collagen gels contract. We have studied the effects of various steroids on the contraction process. Cortisol, beta-estradiol and dexamethasone inhibited fibroblast-mediated gel contraction at low (10(-8) to 10(-9) M) concentrations whereas dihydrotestosterone was without effect. These effects were time and concentration dependent and could be reversed if the steroids were removed. This system may be useful for assaying the activities of various steroids in terms of their activities and modulating effects on connective tissue.", "PMC2965744": "Two experiments provide evidence that 4-month-old infants perceive background surfaces as continuous behind occluding objects. Infants were shown a partly hidden background surface either for a brief period of familiarization (Experiment 1) or until they met a criterion of habituation (Experiment 2). The infants were then tested with nonoccluded surfaces that were either continuous or interrupted by a gap where the occluder had been. The infants in each study looked longer at the interrupted than at the continuous surface, relative to infants in baseline controls, which suggests that the partly hidden surface was perceived as continuous. Contrasting findings were obtained in a third experiment, in which infants were habituated to a partly hidden surface that stood in front of a background so that its edges were visible: Infants gave no evidence of perceiving the foreground surface as continuous behind the occluder. These experiments provide evidence that infants perceive a surface as continuous only if it serves as the background of a scene.

Two weeks after left nephrostomy, surgical exploration demonstrated a right ovarian mass causing compression of the left ureter and obstruction of the bladder neck.

With the exception of dichloromethane and dichloroacetamide, all the compounds decreased the ethoxycoumarin deethylase activity of the enzyme in a time- and NADPH-dependent manner. The inhibitory compounds could be divided into two classes according to whether the loss of monooxygenase activity was accompanied by a decrease in spectrally detectable cytochrome P-450. N-Monosubstituted dichloroacetamides in which the side-chain consisted of a phenyl or n-octyl group were able to mimic the action of chloramphenicol and inactivate the PB-B without destroying the heme moiety. In contrast, dichloroacetamides containing an n-hexyl, n-butyl, or methyl substituent caused a significant loss of heme, as did the five non-amides tested: 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 1,1-dichloroacetone, methyl dichloroacetate, alpha,alpha-dichlorotoluene, and alpha,alpha-dichloroacetophenone. Representative compounds were also examined as inactivators of the major beta-naphthoflavone-inducible isozyme of rat liver cytochrome P-450 (BNF-B), using a reconstituted system, as well as of constitutive cytochromes P-450, using intact liver microsomes from untreated rats. These studies suggested a marked difference in isozyme selectivity between certain of the compounds. For example, of the isozymes monitored, only the PB-B was affected by alpha,alpha-dichlorotoluene in an NADPH-dependent manner, whereas N-octyl dichloroacetamide inactivated not only the PB-B and BNF-B, but also certain constitutive cytochromes, as evidenced by decreases in microsomal S-warfarin hydroxylase activities.

Plasmin was detected more often in large detachments, but there was no clear correlation with the duration of the detachment or characteristics of the holes in the retina.

The reversibility of the changes induced by the thyroidectomy has been assessed by replacement therapy. In thyroidectomized rats the hexokinase activity was significantly decreased in anterior cortex and hypothalamus. The increase in phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activity was probably due to an increase in cellular energy requirements. Hexokinase activity was best restored by treatment with L-thyroxine (T4) or T4+ propylthiouracil (PTU).

The findings suggested that left ventricular aneurysm was greatly due to severe obstruction of the infarct-related right intraventricular branch of a coronary artery.", "PMC4015837": "The administration of an acute ethanol load (2.3 g/kg, IP) to rats is followed by a decrease of the hepatic activity of cytosolic catalase, a decrease which precedes a reduction in the cytosolic Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Desferrioxamine, an iron chelator and scavenger of superoxide radicals, administered prior to ethanol, prevents the changes in the cytosolic catalase activity, changes which are unaffected by the administration of allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. These data favour the hypothesis that acute ethanol results in an overproduction of oxygen free radicals which affects primarily the cytosolic catalase activity and increases hereby susceptibility of Cu, Zn-SOD to these radicals. They suggest also that xanthine oxidase does not play a major role in oxygen radical production in the liver cytosol during acute alcohol intoxication.", "PMC3045799": "Five unsolved problems in the pharmacotherapy of depression are discussed: (a) it is not possible to differentiate endogenous and nonendogenous depression; (b) a selective efficacy of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors cannot be demonstrated; (c) the relationship between plasma levels and antidepressant effect is still unclear: plasma levels are influenced by pharmacogenetic factors, age, route of application, and concomitant treatment with other drugs; (d) evidence is growing for the development of tolerance towards therapeutic effects of antidepressants; (e) no pretreatment variable allows prediction of treatment response: the best predictor is the initial response to treatment.", "PMC4317051": "Though recovery of consciousness after drug overdose may occur within a day or two, the drug itself may not finally leave the brain for another one to three weeks, and at this late time a withdrawal syndrome can occur, with insomnia, restlessness, raised paradoxical (R.E.M.) sleep, epileptic phenomena, and even delirium. It is proposed that a high degree of drug-tolerance and dependence can be rapidly acquired after overdose.Abnormal sleep features of 10 patients resolved only slowly over a period of up to two months after overdose. The data support the view that R.E.M. sleep is concerned with processes of brain repair.", "PMC2651752": "Increased production of thromboxane (TX) by rejecting renal allografts results in significant and partially reversible renal vasoconstriction. In this study, we evaluated the potential benefit of chronically administering the TX synthetase inhibitor OKY-046 from the time of transplantation in a rat model of acute renal allograft rejection. In animals which received 75 mg/kg/day of OKY-046 by intermittent i.p. injection, allograft function was not improved, but renal thromboxane production was not significantly inhibited. However, animals which received an equivalent dose of OKY-046 by continuous intra-arterial infusion for four days maintained clearances of inulin (4.46 +/- 0.79 ml/min/kg) and PAH (23.86 +/- 1.81 ml/min/kg) at normal levels not different from non-rejecting isografts (4.83 +/- 0.93 and 18.33 +/- 2.55 ml/min/kg, respectively). In contrast, animals which received continuous infusion of saline vehicle alone developed a significant reduction in renal function (CIn: 1.58 +/- 0.27 ml/min/kg; CPAH: 9.12 +/- 1.51 ml/min/kg) by the fourth day after transplantation. Intra-arterial infusion of OKY-046 significantly reduced four-day allograft TXB2 production, as well as urinary TXB2 excretion, but had no effect on allograft production of PGE2 or 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Despite the beneficial effects on allograft function, OKY-046 neither altered the morphologic appearance of the cellular infiltrate nor the systemic proliferative and cytotoxic anti-donor cellular immune responses. Six days following transplantation, renal TXB2 production was only partially inhibited in animals given continuous infusions of OKY-046, and remained markedly elevated. This partial inhibition of TX production resulted in a slight but insignificant functional improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3709806": "Antibody against tumor-killing factor inhibited cytotoxic activities produced in vitro by mouse peritoneal macrophages and in vivo in the serum of tumor-bearing mice in response to Sarcophaga lectin.

Its effects on folliculogenesis, bioactive LH, ovulation and menstrual cycle (m.c.) length were studied in adult bonnet monkeys. ZK 98.299 (20 mg/day) was administered s.c., once daily on days 5 to 15 of m.c., to ten animals. The pretreatment m.c. was of 26.5 days (25 to 28 days, mean with 95% confidence limits) and on treatment it was significantly (p less than 0.001) prolonged to 46.9 days (39 to 54 days). The anticipated midcycle rise in estradiol and bioactive LH levels was completely blocked in six and attenuated in three animals during the treatment period. However, the levels did not drop below the early follicular phase levels. In one animal (#90), though the cycle length was prolonged by 5 days the midcycle rise in estradiol and bioactive LH levels was observed during the treatment period and this animal had normal luteal function. Seven animals had delayed ovulation whereas, two had anovulatory treatment cycles. The rise in estradiol and bioactive LH levels, prior to ovulation in the treatment cycles, was compatible with the midcycle rise observed in the pretreatment cycles. Serum progesterone levels during the luteal phase of the treatment cycles were normal in six animals whereas, in two they were indicative of luteal insufficiency. In two animals, the treatment cycles were anovulatory. ZK 98.299 had no effect on the duration of menses. The post-treatment cycles were of normal duration. This study suggests that the administration of ZK 98.299 during the follicular phase blocks estradiol and bioactive LH release and terminates the follicular phase in most of the animals. The follicular phase is reinitiated after the treatment is stopped.", "PMC3291988": "To search for precursors of the neoplastic B cells in a patient with a nodular lymphoma, we produced a monoclonal antibody to a variable region idiotope on the lymphoma IgM heavy chain. Clonal ancestors of the lymphoma cells were identified by this marker among bone marrow pre-B cells (5% to 26%). A second antiidiotype (anti-Id) antibody specific for the complete lymphoma IgM kappa recognized 10% of B cells in bone marrow and blood and greater than 95% of B cells in lymphomatous lymph nodes, including one obtained after tumor conversion to a diffuse large cell lymphoma. Immunoglobulin gene analysis surprisingly revealed expansion of multiple clones of early B lineage cells in bone marrow, including members of the neoplastic clone. The data suggest that this lymphoma arose through a progression of transformational events beginning in bone marrow: first, creation of an oligoclonal pre-neoplastic pool of pre-B cells, subsequent conversion of a single subclone into low grade neoplastic B cells that homed to the lymph node follicles, and later progression to a more invasive form of the B-cell lymphoma.", "PMC3366208": "The fashion in which the aging process affects synaptic transmission was explored in old cats. The synapses between Ia-afferent fibers and spinal cord alpha-motoneurons were studied employing intracellular recording techniques. The amplitude and time course of Ia-motoneuron monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (Ia-EPSPs) recorded from motoneurons of the gastrocnemius medialis motor pool were determined in adult (1-3 years of age) and in old (14-15 years of age) cats. These Ia-EPSPs were evoked by the stimulation of the gastrocnemius medialis nerve in pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. No statistically significant change was found in the amplitude of these synaptic potentials in the old cats compared with the adult controls. In contrast, their time course was markedly modified; both rise-time and half-width were significantly longer in the old cats. In addition, the rate-of-rise of these Ia-EPSPs was significantly slower in the old cats. No breaks or inflections were observed on the rising phase of the potentials in the adult cats, whereas they were present in a subpopulation of potentials in the old cats. There was also a reduction, in the old cats, in the conduction velocity of the peripheral portion of the Ia-afferent fibers. These data indicate that Ia synaptic transmission is considerably affected during old age. It is suggested that these effects in aged cats may be due to modifications in presynaptic as well as postsynaptic processes.", "PMC3952944": "The diagnosis and treatment of a case of lead poisoning in a cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) are described. The clinical signs were jaundice and amaurosis. Clinicopathological findings suggested cholestasis. A tentative diagnosis of lead poisoning was made when basophilic stippling of erythrocytes was observed in a peripheral blood smear. The diagnosis was confirmed by finding a lead concentration of 2280 micrograms/litre in a venous blood sample. Cage bars painted with red lead appeared to be the source of the poison. The lead was chelated by the intramuscular administration of 2,3 dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL) and calcium disodium edetate for seven days, followed by oral D-penicillamine for five weeks. The encephalopathy was treated with dexamethasone sodium phosphate. Recovery from the blindness was noted after 10 days and marked improvement of the general well being of the animal was observed after one month.", "PMC4624779": "By combining elements of two Y-autosome translocations with displaced autosomal breakpoints, it is possible to produce zygotes heterozygous for a deficiency for the region between the breakpoints, and also, as a complementary product, zygotes carrying a duplication for precisely the same region. A set of Y-autosome translocations with appropriately positioned breakpoints, therefore, can in principle be used to generate a non-overlapping set of deficiencies and duplications for the entire autosomal complement.-Using this method, we have succeeded in examining segmental aneuploids for 85% of chromosomes 2 and 3 in order to assess the effects of aneuploidy and to determine the number and location of dosage-sensitive loci in the Drosophila genome (Figure 5). Combining our data with previously reported results on the synthesis of Drosophila aneuploids (see Lindsley and Grell 1968), the following generalities emerge.-1. The X chromosome contains no triplo-lethal loci, few or no haplo-lethal loci, at least seven Minute loci, one hyperploid-sensitive locus, and one locus that is both triplo-abnormal and haplo-abnormal. 2. Chromosome 2 contains no triplo-lethal loci, few or no haplo-lethal loci, at least 17 Minute loci, and at least four other haplo-abnormal loci. 3. Chromosome 3 contains one triplo-lethal locus that is also haplo-lethal, few or no other haplo-lethal loci, at least 16 Minute loci, and at least six other haplo-abnormal loci. 4. Chromosome 4 contains no triplo-lethal loci, no haplo-lethal loci, one Minute locus, and no other haplo-abnormal loci.-Thus, the Drosophila genome contains 57 loci, aneuploidy for which leads to a recognizable effect on the organism: one of these is triplo-lethal and haplo-lethal, one is triplo-abnormal and haplo-abnormal, one is hyperploid-sensitive, ten are haplo-abnormal, 41 are Minutes, and three are either haplo-lethals or Minutes. Because of the paucity of aneuploid-lethal loci, it may be concluded that the deleterious effects of aneuploidy are mostly the consequence of the additive effects of genes that are slightly sensitive to abnormal dosage. Moreover, except for the single triplo-lethal locus, the effects of hyperploidy are much less pronounced than those of the corresponding hypoploidy.", "PMC2500149": "Recombinant fused protein containing human erythrocyte NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (cytochrome b5 reductase, EC 1.6.2.2.) was produced in Escherichia coli, which was linked to the NH2 terminus of beta-galactosidase of the vector pUC13 via a recognition sequence of alpha-thrombin. Cleavage of purified fused protein with alpha-thrombin yielded the enzyme whose apparent molecular weight (32,000) was the same as the native enzyme. The amino-acid sequence from Phe-1 to Leu-10 was determined to be identical to that of the authentic enzyme. The purified enzyme showed an identical absorption spectrum and similar catalytic properties to the native enzyme.

Central fields and anterior chamber depth measurements before and after laser trabeculoplasty are also presented. Intraocular pressures fell by a mean of 12.34 mm (SD +/- 8.5, range 3-23) in all 12 lasered eyes. Central fields improved in ten eyes, and the anterior chamber of treated eyes became shallower by an average of 0.27 mm, compared with untreated eyes (p less than 0.05).

Saturation studies indicate that [3H]MDMA binding is saturable and monophasic in both the presence and absence of rat brain membranes. This apparent 'specific' binding of [3H]MDMA in both the presence and absence of brain homogenates was totally eliminated by pretreating glass fiber filter papers with polyethylenimine. Drug competition studies demonstrated that [3H]MDMA binding displays a distinct 'pharmacological' profile in the absence of brain tissue. These data indicate that apparent [3H]MDMA binding to rat brain homogenates results from artifactual of [3H]MDMA to glass fiber filter paper. In addition, uptake of [3H]MDMA into rat brain synaptosomes could not be detected. We conclude the [3H]MDMA has limited usefulness in radioligand binding studies.", "PMC4144759": "A growing colony of a mutant strain of Neurospora crassa had two morphologically distinct areas which were formed as a result of a rhythmic spore-forming (conidiation) process. The total pyridine nucleotide content of these two areas was the same, but the levels of NADH, NADPH, and NADP were lower in the conidiating area, while the NAD level was higher. These biochemical differences in the adjacent areas of a single colony were only found in newly formed areas, and were not a permanent record. It is not known whether these pyridine nucleotide changes are a result of the conidiation process, or whether they are tied more directly to some underlying metabolic oscillation. However, it is speculated that the changes in the levels of these key coenzymes could have far-reaching effects on many areas of metabolism.", "PMC3095679": "The roles of ornithine decarboxylase and the polyamines in behavioral development were examined through the use of alpha-difluoromethylornithine, a specific irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine was administered either prenatally during gestation (days 15-17) or postnatally (days 1-20) to examine critical periods of sensitivity. Prenatal alpha-difluoromethylornithine administration resulted in a deficit in early sensorimotor ontogeny: latencies in surface righting reflex (postnatal days 1-5) and negative geotaxis (postnatal days 5-8) were prolonged, and time spent pivoting (postnatal days 7, 9, and 11) was reduced. In contrast, postnatal alpha-difluoromethylornithine primarily influenced later maturing, complex integrative behaviors such as swimming and open field activity. Thus, the behavioral effects of alpha-difluoromethylornithine exposure are highly dependent upon the age at which the drug is administered, a finding in keeping with the participation of the ornithine decarboxylase/polyamine system in cell replication and differentiation during discrete periods of neural development. The behavioral consequences of ornithine decarboxylase inhibition during these critical periods are thus related primarily both to the timetable for cellular maturation in each brain region.", "PMC3914314": "In order to assess the relative effectiveness of finger warming and temporal blood volume pulse reduction biofeedback in the treatment of migraine, 22 female migraine patients were assigned to one of three experimental conditions: temporal artery constriction feedback, finger temperature feedback, or waiting list. Biofeedback training consisted of 12 sessions over a 6-week period. All patients completed 5 weeks of daily self-monitoring of headache activity (frequency, duration, and intensity) and medication before and after treatment. Treatment credibility was assessed at the end of Sessions 1, 6, and 12. Results showed that temporal constriction and finger temperature biofeedback were equally effective in controlling migraine headaches and produced greater benefits than the waiting list condition. Power analyses indicated that very large sample sizes would have been required to detect any significant differences between the two treatment groups. No significant relationships were found between levels of therapeutic gains and levels of thermal or blood volume pulse self-regulation skills. Likewise, treatment outcome was not found to be related to treatment credibility. Further analyses revealed that changes in headache activity and medication were associated with changes in vasomotor variability. Because blood volume pulse variability was not significantly affected by biofeedback training, questions about its role in the therapeutic mechanism are raised.", "PMC4036663": "The deployment of a specialist psychiatric team and closer integration with primary health care practitioners has led to a greater proportion of first contacts as out-patients being seen compared with national data, and a relatively lower in-patient admission rate.

Despite this there is evidence of a slow accumulation of patients with psychosis whose main requirements is suitable supported accommodation.

Attention is focused upon the multiple structural solutions associated with the arrangements of nucleic acid base pairs rather than the optimum sugar-phosphate structure. The glycosyl (chi) and sugar torsions (both the ring puckering and the exocyclic C5'-C4' (psi) torsion) are treated as independent variables and the resulting O3'...O5' distances are used as closure determinants. When such distances conform to the known geometry of phosphate chemical bonding, an intervening phosphorus atom with correct C-O-P valence angles can be located. Four sequential torsion angles--phi', omega', omega and phi--about the C3'-O3'-P-O5'-C5' bonds are then obtained as dependent variables. The resulting structures are categorized in terms of conformation, ranked in potential energy, and analyzed for torsional correlations. The numerical results are quite interesting with implications regarding nucleic acid models constructed to fit less than ideal experimental data. The multiple solutions to the problem are useful for comprehending the conformational complexities of the local sugar-phosphate backbone and for understanding the transitions between different helical forms. According to these studies, unique characterization of a nucleic acid duplex involves more than the determination of its base pair morphology, its sugar puckering preferences, or its groove binding features.", "PMC3947904": "Rectal resection with colo-anal anastomosis was performed in 65 patients with carcinoma of the lower rectum. In 20 a pelvic colonic reservoir was constructed while in 45 a direct anastomosis was carried out. There were no postoperative deaths and morbidity was comparable in the two groups. Functional results were determined by clinical examination and manometry. The frequency of bowel movements was inversely related to the maximum tolerated volume (P less than 0.001). During the first year 60 per cent of the patients with a reservoir and 33 per cent of the patients without had one or two stools per day (P less than 0.05). After one year, 86 per cent of the patients with a reservoir and 33 per cent of the patients without had one or two bowel movements per day (P less than 0.01). The maximum tolerated volume was increased by the reservoir (P less than 0.05). The loss of reservoir capacity of the rectum increases frequency of bowel movements in colo-anal anastomosis. The creation of a colonic reservoir improves function by increasing the maximum tolerated volume without any increase in mortality or morbidity.", "PMC3040657": "There is continued incentive for the development of alternative feed resources for use in swine production. The availability of distillery by-products may be expected to increase as the use of corn and cereal grains for ethanol production expands. The acceptability of distillery by-products, milling by-products, forages and other fibrous feeds as energy sources for swine depends on such factors as cell wall content of the plant, degree of microbial fermentation in the large intestine, and extent of absorption and utilization of the volatile fatty acids produced. Physiological effects of dietary fiber, including effects on gastric emptying, rate of transit of digesta, gut motility, digestive secretions, and absorption and utilization of breakdown products need quantification. Limited evidence suggests that there are genetic differences in the response of pigs to dietary fiber and in their ability to utilize it as an energy source. Recombinant DNA technology offers the possibility of cloning cellulase genes from microorganisms for application in swine feeding programs. The extent to which biotechnology will be applied in swine feeding will depend ultimately on the economic incentive for developmental effort and on unknown biological limitations of the pig and its gastrointestinal microbial ecosystem.", "PMC2790112": "A method is presented for testing the equality of some or all (constrained or unconstrained) optima in a response surface analysis.

The mechanisms mediating this stimulatory effect are sensitive to silica in vivo and require the presence of the spleen. Early events are both silica-sensitive and spleen-dependent, while a subsequent stage appears still to be spleen-dependent but not silica-sensitive. Sustained exogenous stimulation by multiple SRBC injections for 4 wk in young mice produces an expanded population size and increased production of pre-B cells and B lymphocytes in the bone marrow, apparently an elevated kinetic steady state of B lymphocyte production. (Formula: see text). As depicted schematically in Figure 1, the results suggest that the magnitude of bone marrow B lymphocyte production in vivo may reflect a basal level, putatively regulated by microenvironmental and other endogenous factors, which is amplified by exogenous environmental stimuli mediated by the action of macrophages located in the spleen. Further questions about such an environmental amplification (Fig. 1) concern the nature of later events in the spleen, the identity of putative stimulatory factors or cells circulating from the spleen to the bone marrow, the receptive target cell stages in the bone marrow and the consequences of this process with respect to the size and diversity of B lymphocyte clones and of primary humoral immune responses in vivo.", "PMC3623917": "To study fallout 3H ingestion in Japan, 16 separate food group samples were collected from Akita during 1985. The 3H concentration in free water and that in a tissue-bound form were determined separately.

The ingestions of 3H in the tissue-bound form and as free water in the diet were 0.60 Bq d-1 and 1.0 Bq d-1, respectively. Cereals represented the food group that contributed the most to the ingestion of tissue-bound 3H. Total 3H ingestion was estimated to be 4.1 Bq d-1. The contribution of the tissue-bound form to the total ingestion was 15%, considerably lower than reported for Italian diets.

The pillars each measured 82 cm in depth, 82 cm in width and 193 cm in height. One of the pillars was bored and 6.8-cm-diameter core samples were removed and cut into 2-cm-thick disks. Two gamma rays of 152Eu, 122 keV and 344 keV, in each disk were measured using a low background, gamma-ray spectrometer, and the activity distribution was determined as a function of depth in the granite. A concentration of stable Eu in the granite was determined by activation analysis. The specific radioactivity of 152Eu and 154Eu at the pillar surface was determined to have been 117 and 24 Bq per mg Eu, respectively, at the time of detonation. The value of 152Eu agrees within 20% of that calculated by Loewe. The depth profile of 152Eu in granite demonstrates a distinct difference from the estimates made only by thermal neutrons.

The maximum uptake of phosphate (expressed as uptake of phosphorus) from sodium phosphate solutions was 137, 82, 86, 138, and 76 mg of phosphorus per gram of dry Dowex resins XF 43311, XY 40013, XF 43254, XY 40011, and XY 40012, respectively. The presence of simulated gastric or intestinal fluids resulted in small but insignificant alterations in phosphorus uptake by the resins. The resins all bound similar amounts of phosphorus and taurocholate (80-100% of the total phosphorus and taurocholate in solution) at physiological concentrations of phosphate and bile salt. Dowex resins XY 40013 and XF 43254, with identical physicochemical properties, but different bead sizes and surface areas, bound similar amounts of the bile salt sodium taurocholate at all taurocholate concentrations, indicating that binding was not restricted to the surface sites on the resin bead. The 2% cross-linked resins bound 3-4 times more taurocholate than the 8% cross-linked resins (at high taurocholate concentrations); the smaller pore size of the latter resins probably presents a greater mechanical exclusion barrier than the larger pore size of the 2% cross-linked resins.", "PMC3426563": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) did not stimulate lipolysis in isolated rat adipocytes, though preincubation with TNF increased adrenaline-stimulated fatty acid release.

TNF stimulated 14CO2 production from [U-14C]glucose in rat hemidiaphragm preparations, but lactate production and alanine release were not significantly altered.

In Exp. 1, prepuberal gilts that maintained the grape-type (GT) or other-type (OT) of ovaries at 140 and 160 d of age as determined by laparoscopy had their population of follicles studied at 165 d of age and compared with that on d 3 of the first puberal estrus in gilts that maintained the same ovarian type (GT or OT) at 140, 160 and 180 d of age. In Exp. 2, gilts that maintained the same ovarian types at 140, 160 and 180 d of age were compared at d 19 and 3 of the first and second puberal estrus, respectively.

Under double-blind conditions, equally divided doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg naltrexone, or an acetaminophen placebo, were administered twice daily in tablet form for 3-day periods each, according to a Latin Square design. The doses of naltrexone resulted in decreases of daily caloric intake from placebo level, but these reductions were neither statistically significant nor dose-related. When the averaged effects of the doses were compared to placebo, five subjects showed intake reductions but the overall intake reduction of 301.5 +/- 198.1 kcal/day (mean +/- SEM) was not statistically significant. Naltrexone administration failed to selectively alter intakes of individual meals and snacks or macronutrient consumption patterns. During active drug periods, subjects lost 0.62 +/- 0.22 lb over 3 days, while during the placebo period, subjects gained 0.46 +/- 0.68 lb. However, there was no reliable change of basal metabolic rate as a function of naltrexone administration. The present results, which indicate that naltrexone administration is relatively ineffective in reducing food intake and inducing body weight loss in obese humans, are thus in contrast with reports that administration of opiate antagonist agents promote significant reductions of food intake and attenuations of body weight gain in experimental animals.", "PMC4215818": "Partial deciliation of Tetrahymena resulted in cells losing 75% of their cilia, with the balance being paralyzed. The paralyzed cilia are resorbed in the first 20 min after partial deciliation, and regeneration of cilia begins before resorption is completed. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide does not inhibit ciliary resorption or regeneration, whereas vinblastine sulfate inhibits regeneration but not resorption. Inhibition of regeneration occurs in completely deciliated cells when they are treated with cyclohexmimide or vinblastine sulfate. It is concluded that the resorbing cilia contribute materials which allow regeneration to occur in the absence of protein synthesis. The volume of cilia regenerated in the presence of cycloheximide in partially deciliated cells is greater than the ciliary volume which is resorbed. This suggests the Tetrahymena cells have a pool of ciliary precursors. This pool does not contribute materials for regeneration in completely deciliated cells which are treated with cycloheximide. It is concluded that resorbing cilia in partially deciliated cells contribute materials which potentiate assembly of cilia from the pool of precursors.", "PMC2865515": "A distinctive new type of autonomic-system-dependent urticaria was seen in two patients. This \"adrenergic\" urticaria is to be contrasted with cholinergic urticaria. Widespread pruritic, urticarial papules developed at times of stress, each papule being surrounded by a striking white halo. Associated with these lesions was an increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations. In severe attacks large plaques of urticaria appeared as well. The halo hives could be replicated with an intradermal injection of noradrenaline, but not with acetylcholine. Treatment with a beta-adrenoreceptor-blocker, propranolol, prevented attacks.", "PMC3280214": "This article deals with fundamentals in evaluation and correction of ptosis, with some references to special situations. Ptosis defies a cookbook approach if one wishes predictable results.

Results of a large-scale survey show that, unexpectedly, this form of anaemia is seldom due to iron deficiency or coexistent parasitic disease. Rather, it results from a previously unsuspected high incidence of alpha-thalassaemia which has been identified only by application of DNA analysis to the populations studied. These findings suggest that hypochromic anaemia in tropical or subtropical populations should not necessarily be attributed to iron deficiency; detailed studies of iron status should be carried out before major dietary changes or fortification of food with iron are implemented.", "PMC4522722": "Space-time interaction analysis was applied to data from 101 elementary school children who contracted variola minor during an epidemic in Braganca Paulista County, Brazil. One school had two and the other three shifts of students occupying the same classrooms each day. There was no evidence found for excessive numbers of cases to occur among unvaccinated students occupying the same desks or seated near the desks occupied by cases occurring during another shift. Only three cases occurred among the 31 unvaccinated students occupying desks of students with variola from other shifts. Only one of these three subsequent cases occurred at a time interval suggestive of transmission. For the three models tested there was no evidence of space-time interaction between time of onset of the disease and location of desk for pairs of students from different shifts.", "PMC2680635": "A study on the bioenvironmental control of malaria was launched in Bizadandi block (Mandla district, M.P.) in May 1986. Besides intervention, using environmental management methods and larvivorous fishes, weekly surveillance and chloroquine administration at 25 mg/kg body weight was practiced. Studies during 1987 revealed that a large number of P. falciparum cases did not respond to the standard anti-malarial treatment. Therefore, systematic 28 day in vivo studies were taken up on the follow-up of P. falciparum cases after administration of 3 day course of 25 mg/kg body weight as per the WHO procedure. Results revealed a high proportion of drug resistant cases belonging to RI (237), RII and RIII (182) category. In vivo studies on the sensitivity to metakelfin showed that some cases were resistant to this drug. There is an urgent need to eradicate this focus before it starts spreading to other areas.", "PMC3431404": "MR microscopy on intact rats using a single surface coil is reported. The use of the same coil for excitation and detection is experimentally very simple and results in a smaller field-of-view than the conventional setup using homogeneous excitation (whole-body coil or a large surface coil) and a small receiver surface coil. Images at 4.7 T with 60 X 60-microns pixels and an 800-microns slice thickness have been obtained from the eye and ankle joint of a living rat with good anatomical definition. This corresponds to a four- to eightfold reduction in voxel size as compared to high-resolution images obtained with a 30-mm resonator probe. Many of the basic MRI experiments (spin-echo, FLASH, chemical-shift selective MRI) may be carried out in a straightforward way with this one-coil setup. Sequences relying on a homogeneous flip angle distribution require a whole-body excitation coil.", "PMC3764097": "In four calves given Haemonchus contortus larvae, the serum pepsinogen concentration rose quickly to reach a mean of 3.5 iu tyrosine on day 14 after infection.

The results showed that the administration of DAMME 60 minutes prior to CRF injections, gave more consistent and more sustained inhibition of spontaneous plasma ACTH and plasma cortisol secretion than either CPZ-M or CPZ-M-N pre-treatment. Changes in plasma ACTH and plasma cortisol levels were more readily detectable in DAMME-treated sheep as compared with saline controls when 50 micrograms injections of CRF were given into the carotid artery. This suggests that DAMME may inhibit endogenous CRF release by an action at hypothalamic level or above.", "PMC4045319": "The influx and efflux components of cholesterol transport were separately determined in pulmonary, peritoneal, and monocyte-derived macrophages from rabbits fed a diet containing either 4.5% fat or 4.5% fat plus 2% cholesterol. Both influx and efflux in pulmonary macrophages increased with increasing concentration of either normal or hypercholesterolemic serum in the medium. The mass of cholesterol entering the macrophages continued to increase beyond the mass of cholesterol effluxed, leading to an increase in cholesterol mass. Similar results were obtained with peritoneal macrophages. Cholesterol-enriched peritoneal macrophages in most cases had a net efflux of sterol when incubated with normocholesterolemic serum. Pulmonary and peritoneal macrophages from cholesterol-fed rabbits tended to have slower sterol influx and a slightly faster sterol efflux than pulmonary and peritoneal macrophages from control rabbits, but the combined effect of these mechanisms did not prevent these macrophages from accumulating sterol ester from hypercholesterolemic serum. Hypercholesterolemic rabbit serum was fractionated by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography into a beta-VLDL-deficient nonadsorbed fraction, which had very little effect on pulmonary macrophage sterol content, and an adsorbed beta-VLDL-containing fraction which promoted a large increase in macrophage sterol. As with unfractionated hypercholesterolemic serum, macrophages incubated with the adsorbed beta-VLDL-containing fraction accumulated large amounts of cellular sterol. Monocyte-macrophages cultured in vitro for 21 hr, in contrast to extravascular macrophages, closely regulated their cellular sterol, primarily by limiting the rate of sterol influx.", "PMC4623519": "A high and low selection line were formed by individual selection of females on the basis of their recombination. In the high line, recombination between Gl and Sb was increased from 14.8 percent to about 30 percent in twelve generations, when a plateau was apparently reached. Realized heritability was 0.12. The absence of a response to selection for low recombination is attributed mainly to genetic random drift, and partially to directional dominance and directional gene frequencies. Natural selection was found to act against increases of recombination above a level of about twenty percent in the measured interval. High recombination tended to be recessive to low recombination. In both selected lines and unselected stocks, intervals proximal to the centromere tended to have a higher recombination variance than distal intervals.", "PMC3561773": "We studied the effects of botulinum A toxin in 12 patients with blepharospasm and 10 patients with oromandibular-cervical dystonia received in a double-blind manner.

Disease related measures were also assessed. Findings from this sample indicated that people with arthritis were significantly impaired in exercise tolerance, flexibility and biomechanical efficiency. Significant differences between diagnoses appeared on a number of disease related measures; however, there was little correlation between disease related measures and exercise tolerance.

H-8 also prevented the inhibition by relaxin and isoproterenol of the oxytocin-induced increase in (Ca2+)i. The EC50 of H-8 in reversing the relaxin effect was 42 microM. H-8 reversal of the effect of relaxin on (Ca2+)i was evident both in the absence of extracellular calcium and in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. H-8 also reversed the inhibitory effects of relaxin and CPTcAMP on the oxytocin-induced increase in [3H]inositol phosphate formation and [3H]phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Preincubation of myometrial cells for 1 h with H-7, another protein kinase inhibitor, only partially attenuated the inhibition by relaxin and CPTcAMP of the oxytocin-induced increase in (Ca2+)i and [3H]inositol phosphate formation at concentrations 4-5 times greater than those of H-8. Acute (15-min) exposure to phorbol myristate acetate (1.0 microM) did not affect basal (Ca2+)i or the oxytocin-stimulated increases in (Ca2+)i or inositol phosphate formation. These results imply a regulatory role for protein kinase A in the inhibition of the oxytocin-induced increase in (Ca2+)i and inositol phosphate formation by relaxants.", "PMC3320567": "The actions and biological responses of anti-estrogens are a function of: the experimental conditions, the parameters, the organ and the animal species considered. Target tissues for estrogens in the guinea-pig during the perinatal period are interesting models to explore the action of anti-estrogens. The summary of the data indicates: (1) In the fetal uterus of guinea-pig in in vivo experiments (after injection to the maternal compartment) tamoxifen acts as a real agonist concerning growth, as a partial agonist concerning the stimulation of the progesterone receptor. (2) In in vitro experiments (in organ culture of fetal uterus or in isolated cells) anti-estrogens (tamoxifen or 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen) act as antagonists and also inhibit the effects provoked by estrogens. (3) In the uterus and vagina of newborn guinea-pigs, tamoxifen and its derivatives: 4-hydroxytamoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen act as real agonists concerning the uterotrophic and vaginotrophic effects, and also stimulate the amount of DNA per organ, but concerning the progesterone receptor in the uterus, in the short treatment anti-estrogens act as partial agonists but they have no effect in the long treatment. In the vagina in the short treatment anti-estrogens provoke no significant effects, but in the long treatment they are full agonists. In neither of the two biological responses studied (growth and progesterone receptor) does tamoxifen and its derivatives block the action of estradiol. (4) The use of a monoclonal antibody to the estrogen receptor revealed quantitative differences in the activation of the estrogen receptor when bound to estradiol or tamoxifen. This observation was in agreement with the lesser extent of binding to DNA-cellulose of the tamoxifen-estrogen receptor complex as compared with the estradiol-estrogen receptor complex. This fact suggests an impaired activation of the estrogen receptor induced by tamoxifen which might be related to the different biological responses provoked by estrogens and anti-estrogens.", "PMC3497308": "The leaves of Nyctanthes arbor tristis, besides being used in the treatment of sciatica and arthritis, are advocated for various kinds of fevers and painful conditions by the Ayurvedic physicians. In the present study, the water-soluble portion of an ethanol extract of the leaves was screened for analgesic, antipyretic and ulcerogenic activities. The extract exhibited significant aspirin-like antinociceptive activity but failed to produce morphine-like analgesia. It was also found to possess antipyretic activity against brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia in rats. The extract also produced gastric ulcers following oral administration for six consecutive days in rats. Results of the present study tend to substantiate the use of this plant in fevers and painful conditions by Ayurvedic physicians.", "PMC2904924": "In two groups of patients on chronic haemodialysis treatment, the common PVC-DEHP blood tubing was replaced with tubing containing tri-(2-ethylhexyl)-trimellate (TOTM) as plasticizer. The aim of the present study was to measure the amount of TOTM and/or its metabolites (TAE s) in plasma, resulting from TOTM that might leach from the dialysis tubes. The arterial levels of TAE s at the start of the dialysis sessions were monitored by Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) analysis once a week for a period of 42 days. A gradual decrease in TAE was observed during the first 21 days of the haemodialysis treatment with the PVC-TOTM tubes. After three weeks, the TAE levels remained constant until the end of the study. On day 120 of the haemodialysis treatment, the plasma TAE concentrations from the inflow and outflow tubes of the dialyzer were monitored during a single haemodialysis session at different times after starting dialysis. At the beginning of the dialysis session, the mean concentration of TAE was 55.81 +/- 14.98 ng/ml (mean +/- standard error), while at the end the levels were 73.34 +/- 17.05 ng/ml. There were no significant differences between venous and arterial sampling points in the trimellitic ester concentrations. Less TOTM is apparently leached from haemodialysis than DEHP. TOTM can be recommended as an alternative plasticizer to DEHP, but its possible toxicity in humans should be investigated before it can be used routinely.", "PMC3117343": "Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystalluria was experimentally induced in male rats by administration of ethylene glycol. The crystalluria particles were separated by filtration and studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. They were associated with cellular degradation products. Organic material was present both on the surfaces of crystalluria particles as well as within them and was organized in radial striations and concentric laminations. It is proposed that crystal nuclei were formed by heterogeneous nucleation. These nuclei then adsorbed organic material and aggregated. The organic material polymerized resulting in the formation of a crystal-matrix unit which then grew and incorporated more organic material during the crystal growth.", "PMC3905702": "Chloroquine, a well-known anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory agent, was studied with respect to its effect on the serum complement system. The drug exhibited significant in vitro anti-complementary activity only at a very high non-therapeutic dose of 48 mg/ml. Chloroquine-induced in vitro complement consumption was observed to take place even in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. The drug also haemolyses rabbit erythrocytes in the presence of Mg2+-EGTA and immunoelectrophoretic studies of fresh human serum and chloroquine incubation mixture against specific anti-C3 and anti-factor B antisera have demonstrated that it cleaves both C3 and factor B. In another experiment, chloroquine failed to exert inhibitory effects on complement utilisation by immune complexes. Studies of the serum complement profile of Plasmodium falciparum-infected malaria patients receiving chloroquine therapy indicated that, in contrast to the situation in vitro, the serum C3 level is invariably decreased. Marginal reductions in the levels of C4, factor B and properdin were also found in some of these patients, while administration of chloroquine to normal human individuals failed to produce any significant change in their serum complement profile. It is, therefore, probable that malarial parasites and not chloroquine are responsible for complement activation in patients suffering from malaria.", "PMC4076524": "Purified rabbit skeletal muscle LDH M4 isoenzyme, but not H4 isoenzyme, was observed to bind to either the crude mitochondrial fraction or a mitochondrial inhibitor. Several sources of LDH isoenzymes in which M-type subunits with an alkaline pI are predominant bind to this crude mitochondrial fraction and are inhibited by the mitochondrial inhibitor. Binding and inhibition have also been observed with H-type isoenzymes with a pI near 7. The binding and the inhibition processes did not occur with H-type isoenzymes with an acid pI or with M-type isoenzymes with pI near 6. The binding capacity of LDH to the mitochondrial fraction and to the mitochondrial inhibitor is very similar and depends on the net protein charge and not on whether the subunits are H- or M-type.", "PMC3934852": "Platelets and vascular cells play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases including thrombus formation and atherosclerotic phenomena.

The first method involved application of viscous drag to red cells entrapped between spider web fibers. The second method utilized cellular dehydration followed by spectrin denaturation at 49.5 degrees C. Measurements on thin sections showed that the isthmus is narrowed to approximately 120 nm by either method, suggesting that the membrane skeleton occupies a zone beneath the lipid bilayer that is up to 60 nm in thickness. The tertiary and quarternary structure of band 3, a major integral membrane protein that anchors the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayers may be a critical determinant of the location of the membrane skeleton within the red cell.", "PMC3835483": "The definition of headache syndromes in the past have lacked precision, not only because different terms have been used for the same condition, but also because there is no general agreement on the essential characteristics of each.

We also examined the possibility that the release of a quantum depresses or enhances the subsequent release of additional quanta. Muscle end-plates were voltage clamped at 3-4 degrees C. Quantal release was restricted to a short, or localized, region of the nerve terminal using Ca2+-free, EGTA Ringer solution and a Ca2+-filled micropipette. The number of e.p.c.s containing 0, 1, 2, etc. quanta were totalled and compared to numbers predicted using Poisson's theorem. The differences between the actual and predicted numbers of events were not significant at the nineteen junctions studied (P less than 0.05). The latency of the first quantum observed in several hundred e.p.c.s was measured and used to calculate an estimate, alpha 1(t), of the time-dependent, probabilistic process, alpha (t), governing all evoked quantal release (Barrett & Stevens, 1972b). In three experiments, all quantal latencies were measured to obtain the actual alpha (t). The alpha 1(t) function gave an excellent approximation of alpha (t) (P greater than 0.2), in real and simulated latency data. The latency of the second quantum in the e.p.c.s was measured and used to provide another estimate, alpha 2(t), of alpha (t). The alpha 2(t) function was lower (depressed) during the first few milliseconds of the evoked release period, relative to alpha 1(t). The difference was significant (P greater than 0.01) in all experiments. Our measurement procedures were tested using computer-generated 'e.p.c.s' containing randomly occurring 'quanta'. These tests showed that the early depression was due to inadequate detection of the second quantum in the e.p.c.s. The effect of Sr2+ on evoked release was examined using double-barrelled pipettes containing 1 M-SrCl2 and CaCl2 solutions. The major result was that the durations of alpha 1(t) and alpha 2(t) were equally lengthened in Sr2+, relative to Ca2+.", "PMC2906508": "The release of prolactin (PRL) from a clonal cell-line of anterior pituitary cells (GH4C1) was inhibited by somatostatin (SRIH) in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 nM). The inhibition (20% of control levels) was detectable within 50 s and maximal within 90 s. Thyroliberin (TRH) enhancement of PRL secretion was biphasic. SRIH inhibited both phases equally. Ionomycin in combination with the phorbol ester, TPA, mimics the TRH-elicited PRL release, and SRIH partly inhibited this effect. SRIH had no effect on TRH-stimulated formation of inositol trisphosphate, and only small effects on TRH-activated adenylate cyclase. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and forskolin stimulated cAMP formation and PRL release potently. SRIH inhibited both effects of VIP and forskolin, and there was a close correlation between the inhibition of PRL secretion and cAMP accumulation. 8-Bromo-cAMP enhanced PRL release, an effect that was also partly reduced by SRIH. The Ca2+ channel activator, BAY-K-8644 and high extracellular K+ increased PRL release, and SRIH caused a partial reduction in the release response to both secretagogues. SRIH lowered [Ca2+]i, and markedly reduced the rise in [Ca2+]i elicited by TRH, VIP and K+. SRIH did not influence the Ca2+ spikes recorded in Na+-free solution, and had no effect on the TRH-induced membrane potential changes. Our results demonstrate that SRIH may inhibit PRL release from GH4C1 cells by (1) inhibiting hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase, (2) blocking the effect of cAMP and (3) lowering [Ca2+]i. None of these effects is, however, sufficient to explain all the effects of SRIH, suggesting that SRIH also exerts a major action at a step subsequent to cAMP accumulation and [Ca2+]i elevation. Since the GH4C1 cells possess one single class of binding sites, this implies that the same SRIH receptor is coupled to several cellular signalling systems.", "PMC3958139": "Leukocidin toxin from Staphylococcus aureus produces specific cytolytic effects on neutrophils and macrophages. The most commonly used method for determination of leukocidin activity is microscopic examination for characteristic morphological changes in toxin-treated cells. The 51Cr release assay was modified to allow quantitation of the cytolytic effects of leukocidin on bovine peripheral blood neutrophils and lymphocytes. Toxin neutralization by serum and milk samples was quantitated by this method. The neutralizing abilities of the various samples were found to correlate with the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG1) specific for leukocidin. Undiluted normal serum samples, however, were capable of partially preventing the cytotoxic effects of leukocidin. The assay was shown to be an effective means of quantitating the cytotoxic activity of leukocidin on neutrophils as well as demonstrating neutralization of cytotoxicity by milk and serum samples.", "PMC3655011": "This study examined hearing preschoolers' ability to use iconic cues to comprehend signs. Twelve nonsigning 3-year-old hearing children served as subjects.

Results suggest that even in a limited choice context, the resemblance of signs to their referents does not enable hearing children to decipher the meaning of most of the presented signs. Discussion focuses on the relevance of these findings to the selection and use of adapted assessment instruments with young hearing-impaired children.", "PMC3157383": "The active metabolite of molsidomine (N-carboxy-3-morpholino-sydnonimine-ethylester, Corvaton), SIN-1 (3-morpholinosydnone imine), from 5 nmolar concentration onward, unmasks SH-groups of rat heart mitochondrial membranes. By comparison, the organic nitrate isosorbide dinitrate was found to mask the SH-groups of rat heart mitochondria. In beef heart mitochondria, both antianginal substances decrease SH-group reactivity but to a different extent. Unmasking of mitochondrial SH-groups also did no longer occur in aged rat heart mitochondria. These findings may explain previous observations that for the formation of the guanylcyclase activating metabolite no thiol is necessary in the case of molsidomine, whereas organic nitrates need extra thiol for activation of guanylcyclase.", "PMC3825559": "For establishing normal mean values of the parameters of the electrocardiographic curve and their standard deviations 50 male guinea pigs were studied. The directions of temporary vectors of atrial (AP) and ventricular (AQRS) depolarization times, and ventricular repolarization time (AT) were determined, and the position of the heart was evaluated. In all animals limb leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF were used, and in 38 animals additionally the precordial leads V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 were applied. The investigations were done by a non-invasive method with a specially designed plate making possible immobilization of the animals in supine position under general anaesthesia with urethane. In 10% of the animals abnormalities were detected in the ECG curve and these guinea pigs were eliminated from further analysis. The investigations showed that, after consideration given to the differences in the ECG curves in relation to man, guinea pigs might be used for preclinical cardiological studies.", "PMC3931646": "Cholinergic agents are known to stimulate the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides in pancreatic islets. The effect of carbamylcholine upon ion fluxes in the islet cells was investigated. Carbamylcholine provoked a rapid but poorly sustained increase in 45Ca and 86Rb outflow from perifused islets. Such a cationic response was observed at different glucose concentrations (zero to 16.7 mM), at three concentrations of carbamylcholine (10 microM, 100 microM and 1.0 mM), and in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+. It coincided with a biphasic stimulation of insulin release, both the cationic and secretory responses being abolished in the presence of atropine (10 microM). At variance with nutrient secretagogues, carbamylcholine failed to affect the net production of cyclic AMP and caused a transient decrease in 32P outflow from islets prelabelled with [32P]phosphate. It is proposed that cholinergic agents mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular sites, possibly through generation of inositol, 1,4,5-triphosphate from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The intracellular redistribution of Ca2+ does not appear sufficient, however, to account fully for the secretory response, which may also involve activation of protein kinase C by diacylglycerol.", "PMC3895040": "This short paper summarizes the basic concept and the technology of a new computed radiographic system which uses an energy-storage phosphorus panel called \"Imaging Plate\" as an image sensor.

Multivariate analyses of variance were performed on several diagnostic subgroups using QEEG variables identified in an earlier study as discriminators. Decreased interhemispheric coherence in the delta and/or theta frequency bands was present to a statistically significant degree in depressed subjects. Secondary major depressives showed a lesser decrease than did primary major depressives in both anterior and posterior brain regions. Depression secondary to organic brain syndrome was distinguished from other secondary depressions by the presence of significant slow wave excess in the former only.

Convulsant doses of PTZ induced EEG epileptiform discharges in paralyzed and ventilated animals and resulted in a large increase in labeled glucose accumulation in essentially all brain areas. ESM alone depressed EEG activity and accumulation of label, whereas PHT alone had little or no effect. Autoradiographs of PTZ-infused animals pretreated with PHT, which facilitated the onset and increased the severity of the PTZ seizures, were similar to those of animals treated with convulsant alone, with additional label uptake in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Pretreatment of PTZ-infused animals with sufficient ESM to prevent most EEG spike activity reduced glucose incorporation in most brain regions, but increased it in some. Selective enhancement of label uptake was observed in the mammillary bodies, mammillothalamic tracts, the anterior nuclei of the thalamus, the mammillary peduncles, and the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei of the midbrain. These data suggest that the mammillary nuclei and their projections to the anterior thalamic nucleus and their reciprocal projections to and from the tegmental nuclei may be important in the mediation of seizure activity induced by PTZ and/or the anticonvulsant action of ESM.", "PMC3662390": "Digoxin requesting patterns were studied prospectively over a 6-month period. Clinicians were not forewarned that the study was being undertaken. Many samples received in the laboratory were taken at incorrect times after the drug had been given. This led to inappropriate action being taken in some cases. Appropriate action was taken on most patients who had toxic serum digoxin levels together with clinical signs. The role of subtherapeutic digoxin levels seems unclear as these elicit a wide variety of responses.", "PMC3546658": "Serum exoantigens of Trypanosoma lewisi were collected 5 days after infection from immunocompetent (untreated) rats and rats immunosuppressed by treatment with either hydrocortisone acetate or dexamethasone. Normal rats were then immunized with pooled, whole exoantigen-containing serum from 1 of these 3 sources plus alum as an adjuvant, and the immune sera produced were tested individually. All contained agglutinating (trypanocidal) antibodies to both antigenic variants of T. lewisi, but only about two-thirds showed precipitating activity with exoantigens in gels. More importantly, however, when these antisera were thoroughly adsorbed with living trypanosomes (from immunocompetent hosts) to remove agglutinating antibody only and then tested for ablastic activity in vitro, all showed significant (P less than 0.01) reproduction-inhibiting activity, comparable to that shown by ablastic serum collected from rats that experienced a natural infection. Antisera from control rats similarly immunized with normal rat serum were negative in all antibody tests. The exoantigens of T. lewisi are, therefore, a complex mixture of immunogens that are related to the known immune responses to the parasite and can elicit the formation of ablastic antibody with the same biological properties as that produced during a natural infection.", "PMC3577749": "The present study further assessed the role of the endolymphatic sac (E.S.) in the generation of inner ear immune responses. Guinea pigs underwent unilateral endolymphatic sac obliteration (Rt) and the opposite ears (Lt) served as controls. The animals were then systemically sensitized to KLH and both inner ears were subsequently challenged with KLH. Absence of the E.S. significantly reduced perilymph anti-KLH levels and greatly reduced cellular infiltration within the cochlea as compared to the control ears (Lt). Control studies demonstrated that neither surgical trauma to the semicircular canal nor the chemical effects of silver nitrate caused immunosuppression of the normal inner ear immune response. From these findings, the E.S. appears to be the main site of antigen processing in the inner ear and a site analogous to the gut with respect to absorptive and immunologic functions.", "PMC4084639": "A delivery system of F- in connection with dental restorations was tested. The system utilized the gap space which often exists between the restorative material and the tooth structure. A known quantity of fluoride compound was placed at a site within prepared plastic cavity blocks prior to restoring with composite resins. It was found that each specimen exhibited a unique steady-state release of F- during a certain period of the experiment. The rate and duration of the steady-state release of fluoride were independent of the types of composites used. This phenomenon was explained in terms of the gap size which could have been influenced by the manipulation and the nature of the materials. The benefit of this delivery system in dental application is its ability to maintain a high concentration of F- within the gap.", "PMC3770923": "The results of the first 50 patients who had fractures of the femur treated with a previously reported medullary expanding compression nail are described.

In the first study, 12 subjects participated in each of 4 conditions; rest or performance of a running-memory task each with either visual or auditory stimuli. In each condition, subjects made four size judgments and their mean accommodation was measured using an infrared optometer. Dark focus of accommodation was measured before and after the experiment. There were no reliable differences among the four conditions, nor between the pre- and postexperiment dark-focus measures. A second study was conducted in which the accommodative state of 10 subjects was recorded during 4 min of rest and 4 min of performing a backward-counting task. The difference between the mean accommodative state during the last minute of rest and task performance approaches statistical reliability. It was concluded that outward shifts in accommodation may be associated with performance of tasks that involve distant targets (e.g., other aircraft in the surrounding airspace) and/or require complex mental transformations (e.g., predicting future position of an intruder aircraft relative to your own aircraft).", "PMC3408653": "We have compared the therapeutic effectiveness of a new UVB fluorescent sunlamp, the Philips TL-01 lamp, which emits a narrow peak around 311-312 nm, with the currently used Philips TL-12 lamp, in 10 patients with psoriasis. We also compared the tumour inducing capacity of the two lamps in hairless mice. The therapeutic effect of the TL-01 lamp was superior to that of the TL-12 lamp in nine of the 10 patients. In the mice, the median tumour induction time was significantly longer in animals exposed to the TL-01 lamp. Phototherapy with the new type of lamp requires a higher dose than phototherapy with the usual broadband UVB sources. In practice this means that more lamps are needed in the light cabinet. However, the new lamps appear to provide more effective and safer phototherapy for psoriasis.", "PMC3209457": "Bacillus piliformis infection (Tyzzer's disease) in foals is rarely observed clinically because of the peracute course of the disease.

The parameters investigated were total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, percentages and absolute counts of T- and B-cells in circulation, subsets of T-cells identified by the Fc receptors, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) responses, natural killer (NK) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activities, and circulating immune complexes (CICs). Eight of these patients were retested 3 to 6 months after surgery. The results showed that there was an increase in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, an increase in the percentage and absolute number of B-lymphocytes, an increase in the percentage of T-gamma cells, suboptimal PHA and MLC responses, normal NK and ADCC activities, and increased levels of CICs in untreated oral cancer patients. In the postoperative stage, except for a reduction in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, other abnormalities remained unchanged. The CICs in treated patients correlated with the tumor load in that in three patients showing recurrence, the CIC level remained elevated, whereas in patients without evidence of the disease the CIC level was either low or comparable to the upper normal limits.", "PMC2904767": "We quantitatively determined the relative contributions of hormonal factors and the nervous system to the total glucose response after stimulation of the cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system of fed rats. Hepatic venous plasma glucose, glucagon, insulin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were measured during 120 min after injection of neostigmine (5 X 10(-8) mol) into the third cerebral ventricle in rats subjected to bilateral adrenodemedullation (ADMX) to prevent epinephrine secretion (observed insulin secretion), with and without intravenous infusion of somatostatin to prevent glucagon and insulin secretion. Injection of neostigmine in intact rats resulted in increases in glucose, glucagon, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Comparison of glucose areas suggests that 22% of the hyperglycemic response is due to the glucagon effect, that 29% is due to the epinephrine effect, and that an unknown factor other than epinephrine or glucagon, which may include activation through direct neural innervation of the liver via alpha-adrenergic receptor, contributes 49%.

In 78% of the cases, there were findings consistent with esophageal injury, but there was a delay in diagnosis in two thirds of these. The diagnostic difficulty was due to lack of a specific symptom complex for esophageal perforation. Often esophageal perforation was not suspected and the symptoms were attributed to the more common injuries, or the diagnostic workup was incomplete. There were 24 (38%) infectious complications directly related to the esophageal perforation. In 21 of these, there was a delay in diagnosis.

The relationship between the anterior speaking space and the horizontal overlap of the incisor teeth shows a similar trend but with a much reduced correlation.

Myenteric neurons greatly differ in their morphological characteristics, projection patterns, and topographical arrangement within the ganglia. The discovery of histochemically distinct types of neurons together with the development of nerve-tracing techniques and specific lesions have allowed a better understanding of the relationships of enteric neurons to specific target tissues. Consequently, these techniques have contributed significantly to our knowledge of the highly ordered organization of the ENS, which represents the anatomical substrate for the neural coordination and integration of the complex functions it subserves. The existence of different types of neurons that probably use different substances as transmitters may reflect on the existence of defined functional roles for each type of neurons. To date, only ACh, NE, and probably 5-HT seem to satisfy all the criteria necessary for establishing a neurotransmitter, although there is increasing evidence that some of the other substances, such as GABA, SP, and VIP, are enteric transmitters or modulators.

Ten animals served as controls; 5 were uninfected and 5 were only lightly infected. The animals were observed for periods ranging from 3 to 17 months, and by the time of sacrifice, all had developed advanced liver fibrosis. In general, the degree of glomerular injury was related to infection intensity and degree and duration of portal liver fibrosis. Some animals had terminal BUN elevation and slight proteinuria. By light and electron microscopy, in the initial stages, only part of the glomeruli were involved and exhibited mesangial matrix expansion and mesangial cell proliferation with intracellular hyaline droplets. At later stages, a larger number of glomeruli were affected and exhibited diffuse hypercellularity, glomerular basement thickening, mesangial sclerosis and less often, focal necrosis, crescent formation, synechiae and global hyalinization. In addition, there were discrete electron-dense deposits localized in the mesangial area in some glomeruli. Immunofluorescent studies utilizing antisera to chimpanzee gamma-globulin and complement (C3) and to human properdin disclosed only faint deposits of C3, apparently in mesangial areas.

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS.

Moreover, they could find clinical applications when the central actions are unwanted.", "PMC3733689": "The mechanism of the denitrification and nitrosation reactions catalyzed by the heme cd-containing nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas stutzeri JM 300 has been studied with whole cell suspensions using H2(18)O, 15NO, and 15NO-2. The extent of H2(18)O exchange with the enzyme-bound nitrosyl intermediate, as determined by the 18O content of product N2O, decreased with increasing nitrite concentration, which is consistent with production of N2O by sequential reaction of two nitrite ions with the enzyme. Reaction of NO with whole cells in H2(18)O gave amounts of 18O in the N2O product consistent with equilibration of nitric oxide with a small pool of free nitrite. Using 15NO and NH2OH, competition between denitrification and nitrosation reactions was demonstrated, as is required if the enzyme-nitrosyl complex is an intermediate in both nitrosation and denitrification reactions. The first evidence for exchange of 18O between H2(18)O and a nitrosation intermediate occurring after the enzyme-nitrosyl complex, presumably an enzyme-bound nitrosamine, has been obtained. The collective results are most consistent with denitrification N2O originating via attack of NO-2 on a coordinated nitrosyl, as proposed earlier (Averill, B. A., and Tiedje, J. M.

Rates of phase shifting of the activity rhythm after a 6 hr phase advance in the LD cycle also were comparable for the two groups and stable re-entrainment was achieved in 11 days. The period of the free-running activity rhythm in constant light did not differ between the groups.

Exercise can have a beneficial effect on the risk factors for ischaemic heart disease but whether this reduces the likelihood of death from ischaemic heart disease remains unproven.

There are two N-linked glycosylated intermediate precursor forms (apparent Mr = 35,000 (p35) and 37,000 (p37]. This receptor differs from the TCGF receptor on HUT-102B2 cells (apparent Mr = 50,000) because of differences in post-translational processing. Experiments with the carboxylic ionophore monensin demonstrate blockade of the transition of the p35 and p37 receptor precursor forms to the mature receptor, presumably secondary to inhibition of Golgi-associated receptor processing. We identify the primary translation product of TCGF receptor mRNA as intermediate in size between the p33 and the p35/p37 forms. We further demonstrate that the p33, p35, and p37 precursor forms, but not the primary translation product, are all capable of binding TCGF. Thus, the removal of the signal peptide and/or conformational changes of the primary translation product are necessary for ligand binding; however, the extensive post-translational modifications are not. Lastly, we demonstrate that at least some TCGF receptors are phosphorylated and sulfated, and that TCGF receptors on phytohemagglutinin-activated normal T-cells are more heavily sulfated than those on HUT-102B2 cells.", "PMC3029329": "The nitrendipine receptor associated with the voltage-dependent calcium channel in rat brain was solubilized by detergent extraction and sonication.

The molecular weight of the receptor was estimated to be 1,800K by Sephacryl S-500 gel filtration and 800K by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. The equilibrium dissociation constant of [3H]nitrendipine to the solubilized receptors was 5.6 nM, which is approximately 10 times that of the membrane-bound receptor. The binding of nitrendipine to the receptor was inhibited noncompetitively by the structurally unrelated calcium channel inhibitors verapamil and prenylamine; their concentrations for 50% inhibition were both 1.0 X 10(-7) M, and they caused maximal inhibitions of 70 and 100%, respectively.", "PMC3533926": "The functions of NH2-terminal propeptides are not known. We have used apoA-II as a model to study prosegment structure/function relationships. The primary translation product of human apolipoprotein A-II mRNA contains an 18-amino acid signal peptide, a 5-amino acid propeptide, and the mature 77-amino acid plasma protein sequence. Its propeptide was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis of a cloned cDNA. The effects of this mutation on cotranslational translocation and proteolytic processing were assessed using an in vitro transcription/translation/microsomal membrane processing system. Deletion of the propeptide did not affect cotranslational translocation. However, without its propeptide, signal peptidase cleavage was redirected to a different site located between the 2nd and 3rd residues of the mature protein. Since the primary structure of the signal peptide was not altered in the mutant, these results suggest that sequences located downstream from the signal peptidase cleavage site (e.g. in propeptides) may modulate, or participate in defining, the correct site of cotranslational proteolytic processing.", "PMC3511052": "The requirement for the glycine residue at the COOH terminus of the signal peptide of the precursor of the major Escherichia coli outer membrane lipoprotein was examined. Using oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, this residue was replaced by residues of increasing side chain size. Substitution by serine had no effect on the modification or processing of the prolipoprotein. Substitution by valine or leucine resulted in the accumulation of the unmodified precursor, whereas threonine substitution resulted in slow lipid modification and no detectable processing of the lipid modified precursor. The results indicate that serine is the upper limit on size for the residue at the cleavage site. Larger residues at this position prevent the action of both the glyceride transferase and signal peptidase II enzymes, indicating that the cleavage site residue plays a role in events prior to proteolytic cleavage. The upper limit on size of the cleavage site residue is similar to that found for exported proteins cleaved by signal peptidase I, as well as eucaryotic exported proteins. The possibility that the cleavage site residue may have a role other than active site recognition by the signal peptidase is discussed.", "PMC2645694": "Despite the lack of evidence of its efficacy, heparin therapy has been recommended for selected patients with ischemic stroke syndromes.

Intracellular recordings confirmed D(-)AP5 to be the more potent N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist.

Similar results were obtained with each of the 4 species studied, irrespective of whether initial development occurs in the superficial (E. praecox, E. brunetti) or crypt (E. acervulina, E. maxima) epithelium. Infection was transferable by gut scrapings and liver homogenates at all time intervals (3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postinoculation) studied. Infection was also transferable with blood and with splenic homogenates but not consistently. Transfers made within a short time of the inoculation of donors were more successful in producing patent infections in the recipients. In all transfers the prepatent period was normal for the species. These findings suggest that sporozoites enter the mucosa very shortly after inoculation, and some of them pass to the liver and spleen and then leave these tissues at a somewhat slower rate, possibly to reenter the mucosa. Sporozoites in the lamina propria of the gut were found within host mononuclear cells in all 4 species studied.

We have partially denervated the mouse soleus muscle just after birth by cutting one (L5) of the two (L4 and L5) spinal nerves which supply its innervation. After 4-6 weeks' survival times, we determined the number of remaining motor units (MUs) and the number of innervated fibres in the muscle by conventional physiological and histological techniques. There was no significant overlap between the remaining MUs. Their average size was reduced from about 230 muscle fibres at birth to about 80 after 4-6 weeks, compared to only 30 in normal animals of the same age.

Catalytically inactive i-Pr2P- and D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2-alpha-thrombin were found to inhibit over 95% of the activation by alpha-thrombin in the presence of fibrin. Unlike plasma factor XIII, the concentration of alpha-thrombin required for 50% activation of platelet factor XIII (a2 dimer) was lower, and the activation was not enhanced by fibrin. However, when the a2 platelet factor XIII was incubated with purified b-chains, the alpha- and gamma-thrombin concentrations required for activation increased tenfold and reached levels similar to those required for activation of the plasma factor XIII. When fibrin was present, the alpha-thrombin concentrations needed for activation of the a2b2 complexes were reduced, and the presence of fibrin had no effect on gamma-thrombin cleavage of the a2b2 complexes. Therefore, the b-chains must inhibit a-chain cleavage by alpha-thrombin in the absence of fibrin. These results imply that the formation of a cocomplex involving alpha-thrombin, fibrin, and plasma factor XIII causes some conformational change in plasma factor XIII such that the b-chains no longer inhibit cleavage of the a-chains.", "PMC3742270": "Two groups, each of 25 Hubbard broiler chicks, were individually raised in cages for 49 d.

Because the volume of amniotic fluid in these samples was limited (generally less than 10 ml), we investigated modifications of this mutagenesis assay that could increase its ability to detect effects from small quantities of test material. Using mutagenicity in samples of urine from smokers as a model, it appeared that improved ability to detect small amounts of mutagen could be obtained by reducing volumes of media and reagents while keeping the amount of test sample constant. This modification resulted in a test procedure capable of readily detecting mutagenicity in volumes of urine from smokers that were smaller than the volumes of amniotic fluid available. Tests of amniotic fluid extracts by this modified procedure showed small increases in revertants, about 50% above dimethylsulfoxide solvent control values. Results of procedures to control for technical factors possibly contributing to these increases suggested that the increased values could not be readily explained by contamination of test samples with mutagens during the extraction procedure. They also were not explained by alterations in spontaneous numbers of revertants associated with changes in the density of bacterial lawn growth. The increases suggest the presence of small amounts of mutagenic material in many of the amniotic fluid samples.

Factors that were statistically associated with fatal outcome were: serum bilirubin greater than 100 mumol/l (P less than 0.008), positive blood culture (P less than 0.013), malignant disease (P less than 0.02), multiple organ failure (P less than 0.02) and age greater than 60 years (P less than 0.031). Mortality rose with the number of failed organs. Autopsy revealed continuing sepsis in 12 of the 15 fatal cases. Because mortality was high in spite of adequate operative drainage at relaparotomy, it is concluded that earlier definitive diagnostics are needed to lower the mortality rate.", "PMC2999348": "The properties of flexor digitorum longus (FDL) muscles and of individual motor units were studied in cats 30-50 wk after self-reinnervation by FDL motoneurons (FDL----FDL) or cross-reinnervation by soleus (SOL) motoneurons (SOL----FDL). Individual motor units were functionally isolated by intracellular recording and stimulation of identified SOL alpha-motoneurons. Glycogen-depletion methods permitted histochemical study of muscle fibers belonging to physiologically characterized muscle units. The observations were compared with data from normal cat FDL muscles and motor units (27). Intentionally self-reinnervated FDL muscles (FDL----FDL; n = 5) were normal in size and wet weight. FDL----FDL motor units could be classified into the same physiological categories found in normal FDL [types: fast contracting, fatigable (FF), fast contracting, fatigue resistant (FR), and slow (S); n = 24], with approximately the same proportions as normal. The histochemical muscle fiber types associated with these categories were also qualitatively normal although there was evidence of marked distortion of the normal histochemical mosaic. These data confirm other studies of self-reinnervation and suggest that self-reinnervation can produce complete interconversion of muscle fiber types. Cross-reinnervation of FDL muscle by SOL motoneurons (SOL----FDL; n = 12) produced muscles that were smaller (about half the normal wet weight) and more red than normal. SOL----FDL muscle contracted more slowly than normal or FDL----FDL muscles and had much higher proportions of histochemical type I muscle fibers. In those SOL----FDL muscles, in which little or no unwanted self-reinnervation could be demonstrated, greater than 95% of the muscle fibers were type I. Forty-one individual motor units in SOL----FDL muscles were isolated by intracellular penetration in functionally identified SOL alpha-motoneurons. Their muscle units were all type S by physiological criteria (absence of \"sag\" in unfused tetani and marked resistance to fatigue). SOL----FDL muscle units had contraction times and fatigue properties that were essentially identical to those of type S units in the normal FDL. All of the seven units, successfully studied by glycogen depletion, exhibited histochemical type I fibers. SOL motoneurons that innervated FDL muscle units had slightly shorter afterhyperpolarization durations than normal SOL cells, but axonal conduction velocities were normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "PMC4041128": "Studies of the composition of milk from mothers who deliver prematurely have focused primarily on macronutrients and trace elements while its vitamin composition has received little attention. This study focused on vitamin B6, vitamin C and folacin in preterm (PT) and term (T) milk which are critical to early growth and development. Fifteen PT and twelve T mothers were studied for five 24-h periods during the first month of lactation. Vitamin C levels were higher in PT milk during the first week of lactation whereas folacin levels were similar to T milk. Vitamin B6 levels in PT milk were lower than in T milk throughout the first month postpartum. These findings suggested that the use of PT milk as the sole source of these nutrients is open to question and that during the neonatal period PT infants need supplements of certain micronutrients.", "PMC2831300": "The effects of short- and long-chain fatty acids on the cerebromicrovascular (Na+ + K+)-ATPase were investigated using specific [3H]ouabain binding to the enzyme. Specific binding increased linearly with total microvessel protein (37-110 micrograms) and was time-dependent with maximum binding obtained by 10 min. Arachidonic acid, but not palmitic acid, stimulated [3H]ouabain binding in a dose-dependent manner, with a 105% increase over basal levels at 100 microM arachidonic acid. Preincubation of the microvessels with arachidonic acid did not alter the stimulation observed. 4-Pentenoic acid stimulated [3H]ouabain binding only at high concentrations (10 mM). Scatchard analysis of [3H]ouabain binding to untreated microvessels yielded a single class of \"high-affinity\" binding sites with an apparent binding affinity (KD) of 64.7 +/- 2.0 nM and a binding capacity (Bmax) of 10.1 +/- 1.5 pmol/mg protein. In the presence of 100 microM arachidonic acid, a monophasic Scatchard plot also was obtained, but the KD significantly decreased to 51.9 +/- 2.7 nM (p less than 0.01), whereas the Bmax remained virtually unchanged (12.5 +/- 1.2 pmol/mg protein). The stimulation of [3H]ouabain binding in the presence of arachidonic acid was potentiated by 4-pentenoic acid, but not by indomethacin or eicosatetraynoic acid. These data suggest that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may be involved in the regulation of blood-brain barrier (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and may play a role in the cerebral dysfunction associated with diseases in which plasma levels of nonesterified fatty acids are elevated.", "PMC3725609": "Serum vitamin E values are depressed in thalassaemia owing to increased consumption because of the oxidative stress imposed both to red cells and other tissues by haemochromatosis. A study of vitamin E deficiency was carried over a period of about 2 years in 161 transfusion dependent thalassaemic patients aged 4 months to 18 years (including 74 splenectomized subjects) all following the same transfusion and chelation protocol (pretransfusion Hb = 11 gr/dl and daily chelation with subcutaneous infusion of desferrioxamine 12 hr a day). Serum vitamin E levels were determined by Martinek's method. The mean value for the entire series was 0.45 +/- 0.21 mg/dl (normal value 0.76 +/- 0.22), with no differences between splenectomized (0.43 +/- 0.19) and not--splenectomized (0.45 +/- 0.21) subjects. Values of less than 0.32 mg/dl (mean-2SD) were found in 50 patients (31,1%). Below--normal values were noted in 5/11 patients at the time of diagnosis. 124 subjects with less than 0.54 mg/dl received 5-10 mg/Kg/day vitamin E per os. In 38 cases it has been possible to control vitamin E level after one year of therapy. Mean values before treatment were 0.36 +/- 0.13 mg/dl and 1.19 +/- 0.35 mg/dl after therapy. No patient failed to respond and no adverse effect was recorded. These results show that by no means all thalassaemic patients are vitamin E deficient to the point where replacement therapy is necessary, and oral administration can easily correct low serum levels, contrary to what has been found by other workers.", "PMC3227005": "Jeune syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities of the thorax and extremities, is associated with respiratory distress in infancy, hepatic fibrosis in some instances, and renal failure that may develop later.

Its activity first appeared at Day 14 in the early differentiating cells, i.e. the narrow cells, and only in them. These cells, found in the initial segment and the head of the adult epididymis, showed considerable activity. At Day 35 they disappeared in the other segments (corpus and tail), while the light cells which became apparent immediately showed more discrete CA activity. No carbonic anhydrase activity was found in the seminiferous epithelium, the testicular interstitial tissue or the rete testis.", "PMC3004466": "Murine erythroleukemia cells can be induced to differentiate by a variety of compounds. We have previously shown that 5'-methylthioadenosine, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, blocks induction of these cells. The present study demonstrates that theophylline, another cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, also blocks murine erythroleukemia cell differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis indicates that this agent inhibits accumulation of alpha- and beta-globin transcripts. These findings are extended by demonstrating that dibutyryl cAMP exerts similar effects. Furthermore, theophylline and dibutyryl cAMP are synergistic in inhibiting appearance of the mature erythroid phenotype. The results thus suggest that cAMP regulates induction of murine erythroleukemia cell differentiation.", "PMC3808083": "Fentanyl, a short-term analgesic frequently used in neuroleptanalgesia, has in a number of cases been reported to cause unexpected, severe postanesthetic respiratory depression which can successfully be treated with naloxone. Several explanations for this rebound effect produced by fentanyl (in combination with other drugs) have been proposed, though so far none has proved completely satisfactory. The possibility that this effect may be due to a secondary accumulation of fentanyl or fentanyl metabolites with opioid activity in the brain has led us to investigate the relative opioid potency of several known or proposed metabolites by measuring their inhibitory action on the contraction of guinea-pig ileum in comparison with that of morphine, pethidine, and fentanyl itself. Two proposed metabolites containing the phenethyl sidechain were found to possess an opioid activity lying between that of morphine and pethidine, whereas metabolites without the side-chain were generally less active than pethidine. Using thin-layer chromatography, it was possible to detect one of these proposed active metabolites in vivo in rats. This result may have some relevance for the understanding of the fentanyl rebound. However, the possibility that multiple doses of fentanyl, such as may be given during neuroleptanalgesia, or interactions with other drugs, e.g. tranquilizers and general anesthetics, may be the cause of fentanyl rebound, remains open.", "PMC3202297": "This study was designed to determine whether alterations in the median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials occur during the stimuli of tracheal intubation and skin incision. Twenty-two patients scheduled for elective surgery and who required tracheal intubation were studied. Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded, analysed and stored approximately every 40 seconds. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and vecuronium used for neuromuscular blockade; the trachea was intubated 2 minutes after induction. Fentanyl 1.5 micrograms/kg was administered subsequently. Evoked potential monitoring was continued until at least 2 minutes after surgical incision. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with an increase in evoked potential latency of 0.8 msec and reduction in amplitude of 1.7 microV. Small, statistically insignificant changes occurred between induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation. Surgical incision was accompanied by a statistically significant mean decrease in evoked potential latency of 0.5 msec and a statistically significant increase in evoked potential amplitude of 0.6 microV. The fact that surgical stimulation produced an activating effect on evoked potentials suggests that they may be used as a measure of the neurophysiological effects of anaesthesia.", "PMC3350225": "Groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to aerosols of nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4.6H2O) 6 hr/day for 12 days to determine the short-term inhalation toxicity of this compound. Target exposure concentrations were 60, 30, 15, 7, 3.5, and 0 mg NiSO4.6H2O/m3. Endpoints evaluated included clinical signs, mortality, quantities of Ni in selected tissues, effect on mouse resistance to tumor cells, and pathological changes in tissues of both rats and mice. All mice exposed to 7 mg NiSO4.6H2O/m3 or greater and 10 rats exposed to 15 mg NiSO4.6H2O/m3 or greater died before the termination of exposures. Quantities of Ni remaining in lungs of rats at the end of the exposure were independent of exposure concentration. Lung burdens of Ni in mice were approximately one-half that in lungs of rats. Exposure of female mice to 3.5 mg NiSO4.6H2O/m3 had no effect on resistance to tumor cells as determined by spleen natural killer cell activity. Histopathological changes were seen in tissues of rats and mice exposed to as low as 3.5 mg NiSO4.6H2O/m3. Lesions related to NiSO4.6H2O exposure occurred in lung, nose, and bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes. Results indicated that exposure of rats and mice to amounts of NiSO4.6H2O aerosols resulting in Ni exposure concentrations only eight times greater than the current threshold limit value for soluble Ni (0.1 mg/m3) for as little as 12 days can cause significant lesions of the respiratory tract.", "PMC4550381": "These discussions are selected from the weekly staff conferences in the Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.

During childhood in Corsica, he had been exposed at home to chrysotile ore from the Canari mine. Analysis of lung mineral content revealed background levels of chrysotile but an elevated level of tremolite and actinolite asbestos. The latter had a geometric mean length of 3.7 microns, a value considerably longer than we have found for tremolite and actinolite from Quebec chrysotile miners but roughly the same as the mean length of amosite and crocidolite in workers with occupational amphibole exposure. No tremolite or actinolite fibers of length greater than 8 microns microns and width less than 0.25 micron were observed. The mean aspect ratio of the tremolite and actinolite fibers was 7, a value similar to that found in chrysotile miners with mesothelioma but considerably less than the mean aspect ratio of amosite and crocidolite from those with occupational exposure. These data suggest that long-fiber tremolite is a potential mesothelial carcinogen in humans, and that fiber length is more important than fiber aspect ratio in this regard.", "PMC2795155": "Aplysia can readily exhibit operant conditioning of their head-waving response when bright light is used as aversive reinforcement (Cook and Carew, 1986). In the first paper of this series (Cook and Carew, 1989a), we showed that the electromyographic (EMG) activity of a discrete band of neck muscles, the lateral columellar muscles (LCMs) of Aplysia is significantly correlated with the component of head-waving (the horizontal component) that is modified during operant conditioning. In the present paper, we asked whether the EMG activity of the LCMs themselves could also be contingently modified, using the same procedures that produce operant conditioning of the behavioral response. Differential EMG from the LCMs was recorded in freely behaving animals with chronically implanted muscle cuff electrodes. Animals receiving aversive reinforcement (bright light) that was contingent upon specific patterns of LCM activity readily learned to alter their differential EMG output. Like operant conditioning of the head-waving response, this operant modification of LCM activity was rapidly acquired and was specific to the contingencies of reinforcement. These results show that a restricted group of muscles, the LCMs, exhibit the essential features of the head-waving system observed at the behavioral level: (1) their activity is significantly correlated with head-waving behavior, and (2) the LCMs are capable of operant modification of their output. Thus, this restricted response system provides a useful preparation for examining the neural mechanisms of operant conditioning of head-waving in Aplysia.", "PMC3121742": "In order to assess the importance of interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R)-positive activated lymphocytes and macrophages in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, we tested the prophylactic therapeutic efficacy of an anti-IL-2R (M7/20) monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the 55-kDa subunit of the heterodimeric IL-2R in two distinct models: the nonobese diabetic mouse and the NZB x NZW F1 hybrid with lupus. Treatment with anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody suppressed autoimmune insulitis in nonobese diabetic mice and lupus nephritis in the NZB x NZW F1 hybrid. These studies indicate that highly selective targeting to activated lymphocytes and macrophages expressing the IL-2R provides a discrete method of dampening autoimmunity.", "PMC3485268": "We conducted a single unit study of auditory neurons in the central thalamic nucleus of the northern leopard frog.

Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or \"desensitization\" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine.", "PMC3370821": "A genetic deficiency in the metabolism of dextromethorphan and mephenytoin may be revealed by the excretion pattern of dextromethorphan and its metabolite dextrorphan, and mephenytoin, 4-OH-mephenytoin, respectively, after a single dose of the test drugs. Existing methods were modified for determining the compounds in 0.1-0.5 ml urine samples. No prior derivatization of the compounds was necessary before their gaschromatographic or mass-spectrometric analysis by using crosslinked 5% phenylmethyl silicone fused silica columns. Seven healthy volunteers were phenotyped at weekly intervals with either 25 mg dextromethorphan or 100 mg mephenytoin, or both drugs. One subject was a poor metabolizer of mephenytoin, while all subjects were extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan. Neither a pharmacokinetic nor an analytical interference was observed when the results of the single test were compared with those of the combined test. The results of the mephenytoin test were also tentatively given in form of metabolic ratios. The GC-MS assay was designed for clinical studies so that patients treated with other drugs could be phenotyped.", "PMC3656115": "Recent in vitro evidence suggests the existence of stretch-activated calcium channels in cerebrovascular smooth muscle. These channels, which may play a role in cerebral autoregulation, also appear resistant to antagonism by the benzothiazepine calcium antagonist diltiazem, an agent known to block potential-sensitive and receptor-operated calcium channels. If cerebral autoregulation involves stretch-sensitive diltiazem-resistant calcium channels, then autoregulation should remain intact during vasodilatation produced by diltiazem. The present study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Using a canine cerebral venous outflow preparation, experiments were first performed to determine the optimum dose and route of administration for diltiazem. Although continuous i.v. diltiazem (1-100 micrograms/kg/min) did not increase cerebral perfusion at any normotensive dose, i.a. (lingual artery) diltiazem at 10.0 micrograms/kg/min increased cerebral blood flow by 36% and decreased cerebrovascular resistance by 31% without significant effects on blood gas levels, cerebral oxygen uptake, cardiac output or mean arterial pressure. In autoregulation experiments, 10.0 micrograms/kg/min of diltiazem significantly attenuated but did not eliminate autoregulatory responses to increases (inflation of an aortic balloon) and decreases (hemorrhage) in cerebral perfusion pressure. Autoregulatory responses to increases and decreases in perfusion pressure were equally affected by diltiazem, but both were unaffected by i.a. saline. These data support the view that cerebral autoregulation involves both diltiazem-sensitive and diltiazem-resistant mechanisms. The diltiazem-resistant mechanisms, which may include the proposed population of stretch-sensitive calcium channels appear to account for up to one-half of the autoregulatory capacity in the cerebral circulation.", "PMC4009775": "The combined injuries of bladder rupture and anterior urethral tear without evidence of pelvic fracture or perineal injury are described.

Sensitization appears to be mediated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and can be prevented by prior irradiation of the Tx product with UV light, known to inactivate leukocytes, in particular, cells with accessory function. In the present study we investigated which leukocyte population was responsible for Tx-induced sensitization and subsequent marrow graft rejection. Surprisingly, neither monocytes nor macrophages or dendritic cells induced sensitization, and all dogs so treated achieved engraftment; however, all four evaluable dogs transfused with UV-exposed blood to which small numbers of normal dendritic cells (12.5 x 10(3)/kg) were added rejected their marrow graft. Among five dogs given UV-exposed blood and normal monocytes (12.5 x 10(3)/kg) only one rejected its graft, and four achieved sustained engraftment.

Enzymically oxidized low-density lipoprotein was also found to be cytotoxic for two human cell lines and for cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells.

Rolling and adhesion of the polymorphonuclear leukocytes on the venular wall were continuously recorded by a newly developed videodensitometer, as changes in average intensity of videosignals in a given detection window superimposed on the screen. Topical application (2.5, 5 and 10 nmol/50 microliter) of fMLP (formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) or superfusion of leukotriene (LT) B4 (0.3, 3 and 30 pmol/ml/min) caused dose-dependent increase in the number of leukocytes adhering to the venules, but a tendency of rolling leukocyte to decrease. Local pretreatment of the microvasculature with a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (AA-1777) prevented the leukocyte adhesion induced by fMLP (10 nmol/50 microliter), indicating that this adhesion was induced through generation of 5-lipoxygenase products. Selective injection of fMLP (10, 30 and 100 pmol/0.1 microliter) by micropipette into the connective tissue close to the capillary dose-dependently increased the number of leukocytes adhering to the venule downstream, but injection of the highest dose (100 pmol/0.1 microliter) close to the venular wall caused no adhesion to the same venule. Similar results were obtained with LTB4 (30 fmol/0.1 microliter).

Furthermore, it suggests a pathophysiologic relationship between the nutcracker esophagus, a disorder with preserved peristalsis, and diffuse esophageal spasm, the classic dysmotility considered to be of neurogenic origin.", "PMC3130272": "The genetics of T. spiralis rejection from the intestine was examined in inbred mice belonging to three phenotypic categories of expulsion: strong (NFS), intermediate (C3H), and weak (B10.BR). Experiments used various worm doses to analyze the day of worm rejection, defined as the day at which 98% expulsion of the infectious dose occurred. The F1 of NFS (strong) x B10.BR (weak) was a strong responder and the F1 of the cross C3H (intermediate) x B10.BR (weak) was intermediate. Analysis of time of rejection among offspring of the (NFS/B10.BR) x B10.BR backcross showed three segregating phenotypic categories which occurred in a ratio of 1:2:1 strong:intermediate:weak. Segregation analysis of C3H/B10.BR intercross (F2) mice produced a ratio of 3:1, intermediate:weak. The backcross C3H/B10.BR to the C3H parent produced 100% intermediate offspring and the backcross to the B10.BR parent segregated in a 1:1 ratio of intermediate:weak. Taken together the results of both sets of crosses demonstrated that strong responsiveness was a consequence of the additive effects of two dominant genes; either gene by itself conferred intermediate responsiveness. The additive nature of these dominant genes suggested that two distinct processes each lead to the expression of worm expulsion that is phenotypically intermediate and kinetically identical.", "PMC3661710": "The histamine H2-receptor on the human parietal cell has been characterized by using dose-response curves and the negative logarithm of the molar concentration of an antagonist (pA2) analyses of cimetidine antagonism of betazole, histamine, and impromidine stimulation in isolated human and rabbit gastric glands. To evaluate the in vitro results, betazole-stimulated gastric acid secretion with and without cimetidine was also studied in healthy subjects. In the in vivo model, individual dose-response curves were shifted to the right with increasing cimetidine concentrations, but this was counteracted by increasing betazole doses, indicating competitive, reversible antagonism. The pA2 values ranged from 6.1 to 6.3. In isolated human gastric glands, impromidine was shown to be eight times more potent than histamine, indicating higher receptor affinity, but the maximally stimulated aminopyrine accumulation was the same as for histamine, and the pA2 values for cimetidine antagonism did not differ significantly, i.e., 5.7 (histamine) and 6.1 (impromidine). In isolated rabbit gastric glands, cimetidine inhibited the histamine- and impromidine-stimulated response with pA2 values of 6.0 and 7.3, respectively. Impromidine was shown to be approximately 100 times more potent than in human gastric glands, whereas histamine had the same potency. This confirms the role of the histamine H2-receptor and suggests a difference between the species concerning receptor affinity.", "PMC3812269": "The sensitivity of dipyridamole--2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography was assessed for detection and localization of ischemia in 21 patients with severe chronic stable angina pectoris, a clearly positive exercise stress test response and multivessel coronary atherosclerosis. Regional wall motion during dipyridamole infusion (0.6 mg/kg intravenously over 4 minutes) was compared with control and recovery by 2 blinded observers in consensus. Transient regional wall motion abnormalities were observed in 11 patients. Angina and ST-segment changes occurred in 9 of these 11 patients with positive responses, but in none of those who showed no transient abnormality of regional wall motion. Localization of regional wall motion abnormalities correlated well with angiographic severity of coronary lesions. Endocardial area contraction, evaluated by a computerized system, was reduced significantly after dipyridamole administration in patients with a positive response (from 51 +/- 10% to 35 +/- 11%, p less than 0.001), whereas it did not change significantly in the others (from 43 +/- 6% to 42 +/- 8%). In the 11 patients with a positive response, coronary reserve assessed by exercise testing (modified Bruce protocol) was more impaired than in those with a negative response (time to 1 mm of ST depression 177 +/- 148 seconds and 472 +/- 179 seconds, respectively, p less than 0.01). In patients with severe angina and multivessel coronary artery disease, dipyridamole--2-D echocardiography appears to identify the vessel in which flow reserve is most limited. Although this information may be valuable, indications for the test are restricted to patients with severely limited exercise capacity.", "PMC2600610": "The appearance of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has brought suffering and death to those who are afflicted. At the same time, this disease has posed enormous challenges to those who care for the sufferers, to biomedical scientists, and to those responsible for public health and social policy. The issue addressed in this article is whether the implementation of mandatory testing for the AIDS antibody is an appropriate and effective strategy to use in coping with the AIDS epidemic. The goal of an AIDS prevention program is to prevent transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections. The pro and con aspects of using mandatory AIDS antibody testing to achieve this goal are given in issue statements. The opinions of leading authorities are presented, followed by a general review of the literature. The literature is then reviewed concerning the issue as it effects the nurse as an individual, the nursing profession, and the health-care delivery system. A position is taken and specific recommendations are proposed for the profession in the areas of practice, legislation, and research.", "PMC3150292": "Stability of liposomes from total fraction of E. coli lipids was studied by their ability to preserve encapsulated substance under different incubation conditions--+4 degrees C and +37 degrees C for some concentrations of CaCl2. Two types of vesicules were used: small ones obtained by ultrasonic treatment and larger ones obtained after successive treatment of lipid suspension with Ca2+ ions and EDTA. It has been shown by spectrofluorimetry and radioisotope probe that for both studied types of liposomes their stability decreases with an increase of CaCl2 concentration and rise of temperature. The effect similar to Ca2+ was produced by Mg+2 ions, but not by Na+ ions. Large liposomes are significantly less stable formations than the small ones. Ca+2 ions were shown to induce at first liposome aggregation and then their destruction. Possible action mechanism of metal ions of the second group on liposome stability, the pattern of initiated membrane disturbances and application of these structures as agents during transfer of biologically active compounds in the cells are discussed.", "PMC3127813": "Regression of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced epidermoid carcinomas of hamster buccal pouch was accomplished by local injections of beta-carotene and canthaxanthin. One-hundred male hamsters (2-3 months old) were divided into five groups of 20 animals. All animals had the right buccal pouches painted three times weekly for 14 weeks with a 0.5% solution of DMBA in mineral oil, at which time all animals exhibited gross tumors of variable size and number. Group 1 animals were then injected locally into the right buccal pouch twice weekly for 4 weeks with 250 micrograms-carotene in 0.1 ml minimal essential medium (MEM) per injection. Group 2 animals were similarly injected with 250 micrograms canthaxanthin in 0.1 ml MEM. Group 3 animals were similarly injected with 250 micrograms 13-cis-retinoic acid in 0.1 ml MEM. Group 4 animals were injected only with MEM; Group 5 animals were untreated controls. Animals were killed in a carbon dioxide chamber, and buccal pouches were photographed. Tumors were counted and measured. Tumor burden in each group was compared, and statistical significance between groups was recorded. beta-Carotene was more effective than canthaxanthin in tumor regression. 13-cis-Retinoic acid had no effect in this system.", "PMC3558695": "Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate hemoglobin (PLP-Hb), prepared from hemoglobin and a four-fold excess of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate by the method of De Venuto and Zegna [J. Surg. Res., 34 (1983) 205], has been chromatographically resolved into six components via a quaternary ammonium monobead support. On an analytical scale, the separations have been found to be rapid (ca. 50 min) and highly reproducible. The results also indicate that the preparation of PLP-Hb yields a reproducible product ratio. The potential of the analytical method for the routine quality control of blood substitutes derived from PLP-Hb is discussed. All five of the PLP derivatives (components II-VI), isolated and purified via a combination of conventional and preparative monobead anion-exchange chromatography, gave single peaks when analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Total phosphate analyses indicated that components II and III each contain two PLPs per Hb, IV and V four and VI six.", "PMC3727187": "Pyelonephritic scars almost never develop after urinary tract infections alone, but require in addition certain risk factors. The most important risk factors are: vesicoureteral reflux, intrarenal reflux, obstructive uropathy, and nephrolithiasis. Most of the pyelonephritic scars develop in early childhood, where we find the combination of vesicoureteral reflux, intrarenal reflux, and urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections alone almost never result in pyelonephritic scars. After the age of 3 years the risk to develop pyelonephritic scars is not more than 10% in those with the combination of urinary tract infections and vesicoureteral reflux. In this age group the risk to develop pyelonephritic scars is not altered by antireflux operation.", "PMC1942119": "The chronic bioassay of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) reported in 1978 by Kociba et al. has been considered to be the primary evidence supporting its carcinogenicity, and is the basis for most dioxin regulations in North America and Western Europe. Because the histopathological criteria for proliferative lesions in the rat liver have changed significantly since 1978, a reevaluation of the liver slides was conducted recently by an independent panel of pathologists. Using current National Toxicology Program criteria, their study showed, in contrast to the original findings, that about two-thirds fewer tumors were present in the livers of female Sprague-Dawley rats. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for hepatocellular carcinomas was 0.01 micrograms/kg/d rather than 0.001 micrograms/kg/d, which had been reported in 1978. In light of these significant findings, a quantitative dose-response assessment of 2,3,7,8-TCDD was undertaken to predict the potential carcinogenic risks to humans. Risk-specific doses (RsDs) and cancer potency factors (CPFs) were calculated by applying the linearized multistage (LMS) model to the combined incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas, classified in accordance with the 1990 histopathological criteria. Based on the weight of evidence regarding the mechanism of action of 2,3,7,8-TCDD, body weight rather than surface area was selected as the appropriate means for scaling rodent data to predict the human response. Using the survival-adjusted data, the RsD for a 1 in 1,000,000 (10(-6)) plausible upper bound (95%) lifetime incremental cancer risk was 370 fg/kg/d based only on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas, and 100 fg/kg/d when hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas were combined. The corresponding upper-bound (95%) CPFs were 2700 and 9700 (mg/kg/d)-1, respectively. These results indicate that the carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD is at least 16-fold lower than previous estimates derived from the Kociba et al.

Optimal conditions were determined for efficient labeling of RNA and DNA with 125I. The proposed procedure for radioiodination of nucleic acids is more beneficial than the methods utilizing TlCl3 because of the milder reaction conditions, the simplicity and completeness of separation of reaction products from the oxidizing agents, and the absence of a toxic catalyst. Using the standard procedure for Iodo-Gen-mediated iodination a specific radioactivity of up to 1.3 X 10(9) dpm/micrograms RNA can be achieved. The proposed procedure is also suitable for radioiodination of DNA.", "PMC2988716": "Since aortic calcification chemically resembles bone mineralization, we tested the hypothesis that a bone mineral nucleator, the Ca-acidic phospholipid-phosphate complexes, is found in atherosclerotic plaques. Calcium-acidic phospholipid-phosphate complexes were isolated from hydroxyapatite-containing calcified plaques and from adjacent nonmineralized areas of adult human aortas. Neonatal aortas, which served as nonmineralized lesion-free controls, contained negligible amounts of the Ca-acidic phospholipid-phosphate complexes. The concentration of complexed acidic phospholipids in the aortic plaques (5 micrograms/mg demineralized dry wt) was comparable to that found in newly mineralized bone and calcified cartilage. The presence of Ca-acidic phospholipid-phosphate complexes in the nonmineralized regions of the adult aorta, as well as in the mineralized plaques, suggests that this tissue may calcify through mechanisms similar to those involved in bone mineralization.", "PMC4004248": "The effects of feeding and various reticular infusions on ruminal holotrich concentrations were studied in an attempt to identify possible factors stimulating their migration into the rumen.

The subject was a woman of 55 years, well-trained in dream recall. The subject was awakened three times at the end of sleep cycles. EEG was monitored for 7 h with a 16-channel polygraph (REEGA 16, Alvar) connected to two systems of EEG cartography: minicomputers (HP Fourier Analyser 5451 C and HP 1000) and a microinformatic system (Cartovar, Alvar). A second 8-channel polygraph (Mini-huit, Alvar) was used in parallel for polygraphy (EOG, EMG, respiration, actogram, EKG). Based on immediate visual inspection of EEG and polygraphic tracings, 500 EEG recordings of selected epochs (of 6, 30 or 60 s length) have been quantified, submitted on-line to spectral analysis (on Cartovar) and stored on floppy disks for further printing of EEG maps. The 16 EEG channels were placed over the scalp according to the 10/20 system and following Giannitrapani's placement. We have chosen a common average electrode. For each of the 500 EEG epochs, four EEG maps were edited (raw EEG between 0 and 30 Hz, 0 and 7 Hz, 8 and 12 Hz, 13 and 30 Hz). Each of these 2,000 maps has been checked visually in comparison with the polygraphic recordings for visual rejection of artifacts or transitory states. The remaining EEG epochs and EEG maps, scored by 2 independent trained sleep scorers, were classified into stages I, II, III-IV, and REM, apart from control runs of active wakefulness with eyes open (EO) and quiet wakefulness with eyes closed (EC), which were undertaken on mini- and microsystems of EEG analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3905695": "Early antenatal detection of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) may decrease the associated perinatal morbidity and mortality. A parameter based on sonographically measured femur length (FL) and abdominal circumference (AC), expressed as FL/AC X 100 and termed the FL/AC ratio, has recently been proposed by Hadlock et al as an age-independent predictor of IUGR. We studied 285 normal and 37 IUGR fetuses to verify that the FL/AC ratio is independent of gestational age (GA) and to assess its value as a predictor of IUGR. Our results confirm that the FL/AC ratio is age-independent above 20 weeks and that its mean value differs in normal (22.4 +/- 1.7) and IUGR (23.7 +/- 1.4) fetuses (P less than .01, t-test). Because of considerable overlap between these two groups, however, there is no cutoff value for the FL/AC ratio that yields both a high sensitivity and a high specificity, or that leads to a high positive predictive value. With a cutoff of 23.5, for example, the sensitivity is 56% and the specificity 74%, and, even assuming an IUGR prevalence rate of 10%, the likelihood of IUGR in a fetus with an FL/AC ratio above the cutoff is only 19%. We conclude that the FL/AC ratio, though an age-independent measure whose mean value differs in normal and IUGR fetuses, is not clinically useful as a predictor of IUGR.", "PMC3692091": "For several authors, DNA tumoral cell content represents an important prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. Samples obtained from 65 human colorectal cancers operated on between 1983 and 1986 were studied. Of 52 cases studied by flow cytometry 60 p. 100 were aneuploid tumors. The proliferative index was calculated in slightly over 50 p. 100 of the cases by DNA histogram analysis. During the same period 30 tumoral karyotypes were established by cytogenetic analysis. In 17 cases a comparison was possible between flow cytometry and cytogenetic results. In all cases a significant correlation was seen between the DNA histogram modal value and the mean number of chromosomes counted by cytogenic analysis. In this study, there was no statistical correlation between flow cytometry results and Dukes classification. Because of the short follow-up in our series, no prognostic value may be attributed to the DNA index.", "PMC3692090": "In cirrhotic patients, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is frequent and severe. This study was performed to determine if low protein concentration in ascitic fluid on admission could predict the occurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during hospitalization. Ninety-two cirrhotic patients with ascites, without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were studied. Bacteriologic study and cultures of ascitic fluid were performed on admission and repeated every 5 days, and if any suspicion of infection occurred; 11 patients developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during hospitalization. Among the 92 patients in the study, protein concentration in ascitic fluid was initially less than 10 g/l in 45 and 10 of these 45 patients (22 p. 100) developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during hospitalization; protein concentration in ascitic fluid was initially greater than 10 g/l in 47 patients; only one of these 47 patients (2.1 p. 100) developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during hospitalization. This difference (22 p. 100 vs 2.1 p. 100) was significant (p less than 0.01). Ascitic fluid protein concentration (6.9 +/- 2.3 g/l) was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in the spontaneous bacterial peritonitis group than in patients without peritonitis (13.8 +/- 10.5 g/l). These results suggest that: 1) ascitic fluid protein concentration on admission is lower in patients who will develop spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during hospitalization than in patients without infection and 2) patients with ascitic fluid protein concentration under 10 g/l on admission represent an high risk group for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.", "PMC4065233": "A study of the synthesis of the intermediate filament protein, vimentin, is reported here.

Serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitors and desipramine, a norepinephrine (NE) uptake inhibitor, were found to significantly reduce their ethanol consumption for up to 24 hours after intraperitoneal injection. To determine if this effect of 5-HT uptake inhibitors could be altered by receptor antagonists, some of which are short acting, P rats were trained to drink ethanol by free choice during scheduled availability, with ethanol being presented one hour every four hours during the light cycle. The majority of the ethanol was consumed during the first hour of availability, and the ethanol intake was significantly reduced by the 5-HT uptake inhibitors, fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. Pretreatment with antagonists for 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and alpha- and beta-NE receptor systems failed to alter the fluvoxamine attenuation of ethanol intake. The mechanism by which 5-HT uptake inhibitors alter ethanol preference remains unclear.", "PMC3404103": "Periodic preventive screening programs will require patient cooperation if they are to be successful. To determine the level of patient interest on a broad scale, 1,788 adult patients were surveyed in 47 family physicians' offices over a statewide area.

Nine percent of these patients reported discovering a previously unknown condition as a result of their recent screening examination. The majority of surveyed patients said they would agree to be screened or treated with the complete list of eight suggested procedures for men and ten procedures for women. Rates of patient acceptance of specific health maintenance recommendations ranged from a low of 54 percent for influenza immunization to a high of 91 percent for a blood pressure check. Listing typical costs did not alter the selection rates of patients with insurance coverage compared with those without it. The geriatric age group was the least willing to be screened.

Three routes of metabolism, that is, acetylation, generation of free radicals (leading to peroxidation of lipids), and osazone formation were considered in relation to the structures of these drugs. The possibility that acetylation can lead to hepatic toxicity, lipid peroxidation to membrane lesion, and osazone formation to glucose and energy depletion was highlighted. Hydralazine, with its potential for osazone formation and great susceptibility to acetylation and free radical formation, was judged most capable of giving rise to these side effects, in agreement with reported toxicity. Triamterene was judged less susceptible than hydralazine to acetylation and free radical formation, and hydrochlorothiazide even less so. Propanolol is immune to any of these consequences.", "PMC3787052": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III) published by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980, and now translated in many languages, has raised a great interest in the whole world. It has probably had on psychiatric thinking as important an impact as the Treatise of Psychiatry of E. Kraepelin at the beginning of the century. The evolution of psychiatric nosology and the circumstances of the birth of DSM-III are described. In discussing the general principles and the technical aspects, the influence of several currents of thought are emphasized: recent remedicalization of psychiatry in the United States, suspicion about speculative theories, return to an a-theoretical clinical descriptive nosology, influence of quantitative differential psychology and of the models provided by computer diagnosis. The nature of the two basic principles: the necessity of attaining a proven high interjudge reliability in diagnosis, and the descriptive a-theoretical nature of the description of each category is analyzed. From those principles derive the most original features of the DSM-III: the use of stringent diagnostic criteria, of a possible quantitative nature and the adoption of a multi-axial system. Some of the most striking changes introduced are the logical consequences of the principles e.g. the deletion of the term \"neurosis\". Others changes such as the introduction of new diagnostic categories or changes in the limits of classical ones (especially schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis) reflect a reaction against previous trends of American psychiatry and a strict adherence to a pragmatic and empirical thinking. In addition, the flexibility of its structure allows for the incorporation of new empirical results. In spite of many criticisms, either against the general orientation or against specific positions, some of which are presented in the course of this article, it is concluded that the success of the DSM-III results from a trend in psychiatric thinking not confined to the United States. Its controversial nature has stimulated the reappraisal of old concepts, and it can be considered as an important contribution towards a closer integration of psychiatry to medicine.", "PMC4586147": "STUDIES ON ERYTHROMYCIN RESISTANCE IN STRAINS OF GROUP A STREPTOCOCCI INDICATED THAT THEY WERE COMPRISED OF TWO TYPES: (i) an inducible, resistant type (IR strains) was seen, which manifested immediate logarithmic growth in media containing high concentrations of the drug only after brief previous exposure (induction period) of the organisms to subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin, and (ii) a constitutive, resistant type (CR strains) which demonstrated, without prior drug exposure, continued logarithmic growth in media containing high concentrations of erythromycin. Subinhibitory concentrations of either chloramphenicol or puromycin, when added to IR strains prior to induction, interfered with their induction by erythromycin. Exposure of CR strains to chloramphenicol did not visibly affect the subsequent growth curve of these strains in media containing high concentrations of erythromycin. In IR strains, resistance to other macrolide antibiotics (oleandomycin, spiramycin, carbomycin, magnamycin) and to lincomycin also was inducible in nature. There was cross-inducibility between erythromycin, other macrolide antibiotics, and lincomycin. CR strains were constitutively resistant to these antibiotics.", "PMC3622181": "A case of Crohn's colitis with unusual endoscopic and morphologic appearances is reported.

When cells were grown in the continuous presence of ketonucleosides, it was shown that the addition of an electrophilic agent (Br-) to the sugar moiety (compound KN-35) increased the cytotoxic potential by ten fold as compared to the unsubstitute compound (KN-43). In contrast, addition of 0-acetyl group (compound KN-3) reduced this effect by three fold. When cells were pre-treated with KN-35, followed by growth in drug-free medium, cell survival was inhibited by 50% (ID50) after 3 min, whereas the same effect was reached after 240 min pre-treatment with KN-43. When drugs were pre-incubated in serum-free medium prior to cell exposure, reduced cytotoxicity was observed. We therefore conclude that the activity of these ketonucleosides may be related to the rate of in fact drug incorporation.", "PMC3794935": "The lactulose-rhamnose intestinal permeability test was performed in 10 cystic fibrosis (CF) children. Urine was collected for 5 h after oral intake of the test solution. A single thin-layer chromatography followed by densitometry was used for the measurement of lactulose and rhamnose concentrations in the urine specimens. The excretion of each molecule was expressed as the percentage of the orally administered dose excreted and the lactulose-rhamnose ratio was the ratio of the percentage quantities of each probe molecule excreted. The mean lactulose-rhamnose excretion ratio in CF patients and controls was 0.16 and 0.038, respectively (p less than 0.001). The mean 5-h lactulose excretion was 2% and 0.28% in CF patients and control subjects, respectively (p less than 0.001). The mean 5-h rhamnose excretion was 12.8% and 7.6% in CF patients and control subjects (p less than 0.05).

Cross-linked fibrin degradation products (XDPs) were measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay with a specific monoclonal antibody (MabCO Dimertest EIA) that recognizes cross-linked D-dimer fragments and related high molecular weight fibrin derivatives containing D-dimer but that does not cross-react with fibrinogen or its plasmin degradation products. PE was present in 19 with positive pulmonary angiograms and absent in 50 with completely normal lung scans. Elevated levels of XDPs (greater than 144 ng/ml) were present in 17 of 19 patients (89%) with PE and in 28 of 50 (56%) without PE (p = 0.30). Among those with PE present, the XDP levels were (means +/- sd) 864 +/- 1,068 ng/ml (median = 470 ng/ml) compared with 285 +/- 395 ng/ml (median = 155 ng/ml) among those with PE absent (p = 0.003). For PE detection, elevated XDP levels provided a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 44%, a positive predictive value of 38%, a negative predictive value of 92%, and an accuracy of 57%. Among those with elevated XDP levels and PE absent, 75% had no apparent reason for XDP elevations. These data indicate that XDPs are significantly elevated in patients with PE but that, in contrast to earlier reports, measurement of XDPs among individuals with suspected PE may not be sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful in screening.", "PMC4063663": "Fibroadenolipoma is a well recognised but unusual benign tumour of the breast.

This study investigates the possibility that the severity of oxidative damage induced by iron in hepatic mitochondria is determined by the level of mitochondrial-H2O2 generation, which is believed to be particularly prominent in state-4 respiration. Iron-induced damage is found to be greater in state-4 than in state-3 respiration. Experiments using uncoupling agents and Ca++ to mimic state-3 conditions indicate that this effect reflects differences in the steady-state oxidation-level of the electron carriers of the respiratory chain (and hence the level of H2O2-generation), rather than changes in redox potential or transportation of the metal-ion.

Tono-Pen #2 was then obtained and tested. Each Tono-Pen showed high correlation with the Goldmann readings (r greater than or equal to 0.86 in both eyes). The overall sensitivity of the Tono-Pen in detecting IOPs of 21 mmHg or higher (as measured by the Goldmann instrument) was 62.1% in right eyes, 72.4% in left eyes, with corresponding specificities of 92.6% in the right and 97.1% in the left. Given the substantial increase in sensitivity noted with Tono-Pen #2, the Tono-Pen appears adequate for screening programs where an IOP of 21 mmHg or above is considered abnormal; however, at higher IOPs (greater than or equal to 30 mmHg) the Tono-Pens tended to underestimate Goldmann IOPs. At low IOPs (less than or equal to 9 mmHg) the Tono-Pens tended to overestimate the IOPs. Perhaps with further modifications of the instrument, it could be used for clinical diagnosis and management of glaucoma patients.", "PMC3867403": "Twenty-three patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in terminal transformation were treated with a regimen incorporating vindesine (a new derivative of vinblastine), prednisolone, and additional cytarabine. Of 21 patients in blastic crisis, complete remission (CR) was achieved in 15 (71.4%). All of five patients with lymphoid morphology and ten of 12 with myeloid morphology (83.3%) achieved CR, while none of four with monocytoid morphology achieved CR. Two patients in accelerated phase also attained CR. Our results compare favorably with those of other regimens in this refractory disorder and indicate that the regimens incorporating vindesine, prednisolone, and additional cytarabine may be recommended in the treatment of CML-blastic crisis with both lymphoid and myeloid morphology and accelerated phase of CML as well.", "PMC3991330": "Electrical potential difference, short circuit current, tissue conductance, and unidirectional Na-fluxes were measured in four segments of the rabbit large intestine in vitro. Compared to the relatively tight, low conductance distal colon, caecum and proximal parts of the colon are leaky epithelia with high conductances. Net Na-absorption was highest in caecum, and then decreased gradually towards the distal colon, whereas potential and short circuit current where high in the caecum and proximal colon, low in the middle part of the colon, and high again in the distal colon. Unidirectional Na-fluxes of all four segments were different. The discrepancy between the short circuit current and net Na-absorption in the two segments of the proximal colon indicates electrogenic transport of other ions. 0.1 mM ouabain virtually abolished short circuit current and Na-absorption in all segments, whereas 0.1 mM amiloride was not effective in the caecum and the proximal colonic parts. The present study focuses on the comparative aspects of Na-transport. It demonstrates the marked segmental heterogeneity of the basic electrical properties and suggests four different segmental organizations of large intestinal electrolyte transport.", "PMC2918797": "Individual speech tracking data were analyzed in relation to other variables in 11 adult users of the Nucleus multichannel cochlear implant.

Following extensive purification, homogeneous preparations of full and empty PPV preparations were obtained and used for in vitro and in vivo analyses. In the first in vitro experiment, swine testes cells were infected with mixtures of various ratios of empty and full (E/F) particles. The production of both intracellular and extracellular virus was markedly inhibited in the presence of empty particles. This inhibition was dependent upon the concentration of empty particles present in the mixture. In the second in vitro study, various concentrations of empty particles were added prior to full virus infection. Again, marked inhibition of progeny virus production was evident and related to the concentrations of empty particles added. Based on the results of in vitro studies, the influence of empty particles on PPV infection in swine was tested by infecting mid-term and late-term gestation swine fetuses with various E/F particle ratios. Both mid-term and late-term fetuses exposed to 0:1, 1:1 and 5:1 E/F ratios displayed gross pathological evidence of PPV infection whereas fetuses exposed to E/F ratios of 30:1 or greater were grossly normal in appearance. However, fetuses infected with 30:1, 50:1 and 300:1 E/F ratios showed evidence of virus in their tissues by DNA hybridization. Regardless of the E/F ratios, late-term infected fetuses responded with high antibody titers ranging from 1024 to 4096. The results from these studies suggested that empty particles interfered with viral replication in both cell culture and in animals.", "PMC3998973": "Head turning in patients with spasmus nutans seems to transiently dampen the nystagmus.

Both organisms produced cadaverine at concentrations similar to those reported previously in naturally contaminated beef stored under the same conditions. Putrescine concentrations produced by the two organisms, however, were an order of magnitude lower. During the growth on beef of either H. alvei or S. liquefaciens in mixed culture with arginine-utilizing strains of streptobacteria, putrescine as well as cadaverine concentrations were similar to those detected in naturally contaminated samples.", "PMC3110247": "We have previously reported that airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in subjects with asthma is increased 40 to 60 minutes after challenge with ultrasonically nebulized water. This study reveals that increased responsiveness to methacholine is abolished by administration of cromolyn sodium before the water challenge. The mean dose of methacholine (95% confidence limits) inducing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was 1.10 mumol (0.43 to 2.80). The PD20 after water challenge was 0.42 mumol (0.17 to 1.01) that was significantly lower (p less than 0.005) than that observed for the initial challenge. Administration of cromolyn before the water challenge abolished this increased responsiveness to methacholine. The mean PD20 was 1.32 mumol (0.47 to 3.68) that was not significantly different from that measured for the initial methacholine challenge. Methacholine responsiveness was unchanged when challenge was performed 40 to 60 minutes after cromolyn alone or after methacholine itself. We conclude that cromolyn abolishes the increased responsiveness to methacholine and probably does so by inhibiting the release of mediators.", "PMC3610147": "The induction of fragile sites on human chromosomes has been demonstrated under various conditions that cause thymidylate stress, including exposure to uridine. In this study, we examined common fragile site expression by initially exposing peripheral lymphocytes to uridine, followed by repair of the fragile sites with media containing various concentrations of thymidine. Lymphocytes were cultured in medium 199 with 2 mM uridine. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, and 18 h before harvest, the uridine medium was removed and replaced by medium containing thymidine at various concentrations. Our results demonstrate that the effect of uridine on chromosome fragility can be reversed by low concentrations of thymidine (2 microM up to 200 microM) and the \"rescuing\" effect of thymidine can be achieved if the cells were treated prior to 2-3 h before harvest. No repair was found if thymidine was added to culture within 2 h prior to harvesting, suggesting that packing of chromosomes is also an important factor in the expression and repair of fragile sites.", "PMC4074406": "Fluorescein-labelled sulodexide tissue distribution was studied in the rat after intravenous administration at the dosage of 15 mg/kg. A globular fluorescence was observed mainly in the extracellular matrix and a diffuse one was present in liver and kidney parenchyma lasting for a long time, up to 4 h after administration. In particular in the kidney cortex the fluorescent material was present at the higher time intervals.

In this discussion the authors focus on the effects on the child and family life. Comparisons are made with the effects of chronic illness on a family. The documentation of the effects of OME on family life is significant to assist health care professionals in appreciating the gravity of this often trivialized illness.

The rec proteins have been designated \"s-rec\" and \"m-rec\" to indicate their respective tissues of origin. The two proteins differ in molecular weight and in their response to temperature, the latter being consistent with the optimal temperature for physiological function of their tissues of origin. There is a major increase in m-rec protein with the entry of cells into meiosis, the peak of activity being early pachytene. Extracts of the cells and also those of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have been prepared that have the capacity to catalyze homologous recombination. These extracts behave similarly to the m-rec proteins upon entry of cells into meiosis. Yeast transferred to sporulation medium displays a 100-fold increase in the recombination activity of the extract at about the time of entry into meiosis. The occurrence of peak levels of m-rec and recombination activity in extracts from cells in early pachytene points strongly to that stage as the time at which the enzymatic phase of recombination occurs.", "PMC3394247": "Radioactive material from the Chernobyl reactor was deposited over the United Kingdom between May 2 and May 4, 1986. In this report, the 131I content of ovine thyroid glands, collected from seven abattoirs in Wales and south-west England is used to monitor the geographical distribution of the contamination. The results indicate that there was considerable local variation in the degree of contamination and suggest that, in addition to the major areas of contamination, deposition of high levels of radioactive material also occurred in isolated areas in the south-west of England. These observations confirm the value of monitoring 131I in the thyroid glands of grazing ruminants as a sensitive index of environmental contamination with the products of nuclear fission.", "PMC3592393": "The effects of fluoride ingestion (3.5 mg/kg of body weight) were evaluated in 9 ewes at 6 through 9, 10 through 13, or 14 through 17 months of age (3 ewes/age group). In the 3 groups, the plasma fluoride concentration rapidly increased to 0.45, 0.46, and 0.50 microgram/ml, respectively, and decreased rapidly to 0.1 microgram/ml after fluoride was removed from the ration. In 5 of the 9 ewes, this short-term exposure caused symmetrical, moderate damage to the molars, which is characteristic of fluorosis in sheep. In 7 of the 9 ewes, abnormal gaps were found between incisors, which are not characteristic of fluorosis in sheep. Fluoride accumulation was higher in the roots of the incisors and in the dentine of the molars and was particularly evident in teeth that were developing when fluoride was administered; however, the fully developed teeth and teeth that developed several months after administration of fluoride also were affected. The increase in fluoride concentration in the enamel was confined to a maximum of 2 molars. The abnormal wear of the molars was not directly linked to fluoride accumulation.", "PMC3629236": "A novel mobilizable intracellular compartment was identified in human neutrophils by latent alkaline phosphatase activity.

In this article, dementia is delimited only by its symptoms; the etiology, the course, and the extensiveness of the disorder are not used as criteria of a dementia syndrome. In the descriptive diagnoses of dementia disorders, however, different aspects of the disorders are used. Descriptive diagnoses are (a) benign senile forgetfulness, (b) primary degenerative disorders, (c) secondary dementias, (d) cerebrovascular disorders with dementia, (e) reversible dementias, and (f) dementias with unknown etiology. Primary degenerative disorders include the subgroups (a) senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT), (b) Alzheimer's disease (AD), (c) Pick's disease, and (d) Huntington's chorea. The question whether SDAT a nd AD should be included in one group is discussed. Very interesting and stimulating treatment research is going on in the field of dementias. Although there has still been no real breakthrough, some results indicate that dementia symptoms may be influenced by treatment. At present, treatment strategies go along the following lines: (a) pharmacological treatment, (b) control of sleep apneas and circulatory disturbances, (c) brain tissue transplantation, and (d) psychotherapy and mental activation. The pharmacologyical manipulation of dementia disorders focuses on substituting failing neurotransmitter systems. The use of nootropic drugs and gangliosides is still at an experimental level. Findings of vitamin B12 deficiency in late-onset dementia make vitamin B12 substitution relevant.

We compared 18- to 24-hour esophageal pH recordings with gastric emptying of radionuclide in apple juice in 109 children (2 weeks to 16 years old) referred for an evaluation of GER. A pH score and the pattern of GER (type I, II, and III) were obtained by esophageal pH monitoring. Gastric emptying was measured at 30 minutes (%GE30) and at 60 minutes (%GE60). The measured gastric emptying of apple juice was similar for the normal child and for those with GER regardless of pattern type. An inverse linear correlation between postcibal reflex and measured gastric emptying was demonstrated only by the eight asymptomatic children with a normal pH score (%GE30, r = -.9603, P less than .001; and %GE60, r = -.8263, P less than .05). If the contribution of postcibal reflux on gastric emptying was eliminated, then the effective gastric emptying was increased in many children with the type I (44%, P less than .05), type II (46%, P less than .05), or type III (60%, P less than .05) pattern of GER as compared with children with a normal reflux pattern (7%). In conclusion, measured gastric emptying of clear liquids is not necessarily decreased in most children with GER. Furthermore, many children with GER demonstrate an increased effective gastric emptying even though measured gastric emptying may not appear increased.", "PMC1891445": "A field study of the role of metallothionein (MT) in the binding of heavy metals in perch (Perca fluviatilis), exposed to moderate levels of copper, zinc and cadmium, was performed. Perch were sampled at four sites in Sweden in September during two consecutive years. Two sites were located in the vicinity of a brassworks and two outside the emission range. The first year, fish from the two brassworks sites and from one of the uncontaminated sites were collected. The second year, fish from the most contaminated site and from the two uncontaminated sites were caught. The levels of hepatic copper, zinc and cadmium reflected the concentrations of these metals in water and were increased in fish from the two contaminated sites. The level of cadmium in liver was relatively low. MT was induced in liver of perch caught at the most contaminated site. The hepatic MT content in individual livers correlated well to the accumulation of copper (r = 0.85, P less than 0.001) and zinc (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001). There was a low but significant correlation between the levels of MT and cadmium in the liver (r = 0.48, P less than 0.001). The relationship between MT and metals was very similar both years. Subcellular fractionation of the metals in the liver revealed that an induction of MT was followed by an increased amount of copper, zinc and cadmium bound to the protein. The relative fraction of the total hepatic copper and cadmium bound to MT was increased at the most contaminated site, whereas there was no difference in subcellular distribution of zinc between the sites. In perch from the most contaminated site, the portions of hepatic copper, zinc and cadmium found in the cytosolic fraction were 70, 57 and 81%, respectively. Seventy-one % of the copper, 29% of the zinc and 84% of the cadmium found in hepatic cytosol of fish from the same site, eluted together with MT after gel filtration chromatography. The analysis of the subcellular distribution of copper, zinc and cadmium demonstrates that MT is responsible for the binding of a large amount of the total hepatic cellular content of copper and cadmium in perch.", "PMC3668285": "The effect of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) concentration on the permeability of neonatal rat stratum corneum to 14C labeled propan-1-ol and hexan-1-ol was studied in vitro. The permeability coefficients were determined from a range of DMSO-water systems. After soaking in water overnight, the same stratum corneum was used with water as both delivery and recipient phases for the alkanols. Concentrations below 70% DMSO reduced the penetration rate as a result of the solvent effect of DMSO and the formation of a DMSO-alkanol complex. Above 70% DMSO permeability increased, with a permeability coefficient greater than that from water being achieved at concentrations in excess of 80% DMSO. The second run, with water as delivery phase, showed that the effect was reversible below 70% DMSO, but that at higher concentrations DMSO had produced an irreversible change in the permeability of stratum corneum. We hypothesize a hydrogen bond-mediated mechanism for the increased permeability.", "PMC3606170": "In ten cases of neurotropic melanoma, patients presented with nodules composed of amelanotic, deeply infiltrating neuroid fascicles. Only four cases were clinically suggestive of melanoma. In eight of the tumors, a precursor lesion was found histologically and provided a major clue to the diagnosis. In seven cases, the dysplastic precursor was lentiginous, while a superficial spreading pattern was present in one. Initial surgery was often inadequate because of the difficulty in defining tumor margins and the lack of pigment. In seven of the tumors, S100 protein was demonstrated within the invasive spindle cell component by the immunoperoxidase method. This finding was negative in three cases, two of which showed positive staining of the precursor and nerve filaments, indicating that the absence of S100 protein cannot be used as an exclusion criterion for neurotropic melanoma.", "PMC3676452": "The experiments on adult freely behaving cats have shown that the injection of penicillin into the internal part (TI) of bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) caused the formation of the generator of pathologically enhanced excitation (GPEE).

In this article, acoustic analyses are reported which show that the spectral properties of stuttered vowels are similar to the following fluent vowel, so it would appear that the stutterers are articulating the vowel appropriately. Though spectral properties of the stuttered vowels are normal, others are unusual: The stuttered vowels are low in amplitude and short in duration. In two experiments, the effects of amplitude and duration on perception of these vowels are examined. It is shown that, if the amplitude of stuttered vowels is made normal and their duration is lengthened, they sound more like the intended vowels. These experiments lead to the conclusion that low amplitude and short duration are the factors that cause stuttered vowels to sound like schwa. This differs from the view of certain clinicians and theorists who contend that stutterers actually articulate /schwa/'s when these are heard in stuttered speech. Implications for stuttering therapy are considered.", "PMC3732441": "Chronic 'blindness' was produced in monkeys by a lesion that combined right optic tract section, forebrain commissurotomy, and a large cortical ablation in the left hemisphere that spared most of the modality specific visual cortex.

All strains grew in defined mineral salts medium; two of them were further characterized. The bacteria were facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods; metabolism was strictly oxidative with molecular oxygen, nitrate, or nitrite as electron acceptor. The isolates were tentatively identified as pseudomonads. Besides phenol many other benzene derivatives like cresols or aromatic acids were anaerobically oxidized in the presence of nitrate. While benzoate or 4-hydroxybenzoate was degraded both anaerobically and aerobically, phenol was oxidized under anaerobic conditions only. Reduced alicyclic compounds were not degraded. Preliminary evidence is presented that the first reaction in anaerobic phenol oxidation is phenol carboxylation to 4-hydroxybenzoate.", "PMC3732443": "In Wistar rats we have studied the effect of inferior olive lesion or activation on the threshold of a flexor reflex elicited by a nociceptive stimulus applied to the hindpaw. When the inferior olive is lesioned by means of 3-acetylpyridine, the threshold value is significantly decreased. A recovery occurs in 3-4 weeks. When the inferior olive is activated by means of harmaline, the threshold value is significantly increased. These experiments suggest the inferior olive activity exerts an inhibitory effect on flexor reflex activity. The recovery of the threshold value depends, probably, on the plastic reorganization of the cerebellar circuits, which occurs after inferior olive lesion.", "PMC3630739": "In order to evaluate relationships between structure and concentric function of the quadriceps muscle, isokinetic maximum knee extensor output at different velocities of angular motion (30-180 degrees s-1), integrated electromyographic activity (iEMG), cross-sectional area (CSA) of m. quadriceps and fibre composition of m. vastus lateralis were analysed in five sprinters and five marathon runners (all males). Both output and input parameters, concerning peak torque (PT), instantaneous power (IP), contractional work (CW) and the summed iEMG were closely correlated to the m. quadriceps CSA, as well as to the calculated absolute type II (A + B), IIA and IIB fibre areas of m. vastus lateralis. When PT, IP, CW and the summed iEMG were corrected for CSA, such relationships were found only at 180 degrees s-1 and only for type IIA fibre area. The electromyographic findings indicate that m. vastus lateralis was representative for the total mechanical output. The calculated mean power output (CW s-1) and output/input balance (CW/iEMG) describe similar relationships with the velocity of angular motion and were not related to the CSA or to the absolute area of any fibre type. The calculated optimal CW per second and CW/iEMG occur for sprinters at about 450 degrees s-1 and for marathon runners at about 270 degrees s-1, that is, velocities well above the capacity of the isokinetic dynamometer. Our observations indicate that the peak torque or instantaneous power, during single maximum knee extensions, at least at 180 degrees s-1, express characteristics of the muscle structure.", "PMC3956140": "To eliminate variability due to nonspecific stimulation or inhibition by different lots of fetal bovine serum, the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a modification of Iscove's medium (medium C-IMDM) was compared with the routinely used Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was enhanced and occurred at lower mitogen concentrations in C-IMDM compared with cells grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Maximum incorporation of [3H]thymidine following stimulation by concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen was more than twice the peak values obtained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Concentrations of concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin required for maximum stimulation were 0.5 and 15 micrograms/ml, and 0.3 and 1.0 micrograms/ml . 5 X 10(5) cells in C-IMDM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Cells grown in C-IMDM responded to lower concentrations of pokeweed mitogen and optimal growth in the serum-free medium required 0.4 micrograms/ml . 5 X 10(5) cells. The stimulation of immunoglobulin-producing cells in C-IMDM was enhanced and occurred at lower concentrations of pokeweed mitogen. Less variability of growth (i.e., incorporation of [3H]thymidine) and immunoglobulin synthesis occurred in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in different preparations of C-IMDM than that reported for cells cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with different lots or batches of fetal bovine serum.

Combined gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of the acyl and alcohol portions of the wax ester revealed dramatic seasonal variation. Of the total of nearly 100 compounds detected in the acyl portion, more than 90 were identified as n-, monomethyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyl-C6 to C20 acids. The major components were 2-methyl- and 4-methyl C6 acids which constituted nearly 75% of the total acids during most of the year. As the birds went through the post-nuptial molt into eclipse, these short chain acids decreased to only 4% of the total acids. Fatty acids longer than C12 became the major components during the summer months when the birds were in eclipse and by fall the characteristic shorter branched acids reappeared as the dominant components. Fatty alcohols did not undergo such dramatic changes.

However, stable unilamellar liposomes could be prepared by mixing DOPE with a minimum of 12% of a haptenated lipid, N-(dinitrophenylaminocaproyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (DNP-cap-PE). When the liposomes bound to rabbit anti-DNP IgG that had been adsorbed on a glass surface, lysis of the liposome occurred with the release of the contents into the medium as judged by the fluorescence enhancement of an entrapped self-quenching dye, calcein. On the other hand, incubation of the same liposomes with glass surfaces coated with normal rabbit IgG had little effect. In addition, free anti-DNP IgG induced aggregation of the liposomes but did not cause any dye release. Liposomes composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and DNP-cap-PE did not lyse when added to the glass surfaces coated with either anti-DNP IgG or normal IgG. A likely mechanism for liposome lysis is that the DNP-cap-PE laterally diffuse to the contact area between the liposome and the glass. Binding of the haptenated lipid with the immobilized and multivalent antibody trap the haptenated lipids in the contact area. As a result of lateral phase separation, lipids may undergo the bilayer to hexagonal phase transition, leading to the leakage of the entrapped dye. Because both the free hapten and the free antibody inhibited the liposome leakage, this process could be used to assay for the free hapten or antibody. We have shown that inhibition assays performed by using this principle can easily detect 10 pmol of free DNP-glycine in 40 microliter. Furthermore, by substituting human glycophorin A, a transmembrane glycoprotein, for the lipid hapten, we have demonstrated that this assay system is also applicable to detect protein antigen with a sensitivity of sub-nanogram level.", "PMC3789673": "Intravenous high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy may produce acute, subacute, or chronic neurotoxicity in patients with cancer.

The 19F chemical shift of 2FD bound to d(A-T)5 was approximately 1.5 ppm downfield of that observed for 2FD bound to d(G-C)5. By mixing equimolar amounts of aqueous d(G-C)5, d(A-T)5 and 2FD, the distribution of drug between the nucleotides was followed by observing relative peak intensities and showed no G-C or A-T binding preference at room temperature. It was shown that each decanucleotide duplex bound three 2FD molecules, giving a neighbour exclusion parameter, n, of n = 3 for this drug. The stoichiometric complexes, which we denote by [d(A-T)5][2FD]3 and [d(G-C)5][2FD]3, were also purified and isolated in this study.", "PMC3398044": "We have developed an algorithm which can be used to correct the geometric distortion of digital images. The method uses an orthonormal decomposition and a two-dimensional Horner's scheme to construct and evaluate a polynomial equation of arbitrary degree in two independent variables. This numerical scheme for geometric correction combines several methods selected on the basis of their computation efficiency and numerical stability. The differences and advantages of this numerical scheme are compared with methods found in the image processing literature. The algorithm presented here has a reduced number of mathematical operations, is flexible and numerically stable. Based on the least-squares criteria, the algorithm provides corrected pixel positions with an accuracy equal to or better than the pixel size.", "PMC2973819": "Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells were successfully generated in all cases from blood mononuclear cells obtained from six patients with lymphoma. The LAK cells from three of these patients and from five normal adult donors were tested for their effector abilities in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against guinea pig leukemic lymphocytes coated with various antiidiotype antibodies. Cells from all the donors behaved similarly. Mouse monoclonal antibodies of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes invoked no ADCC. However, substantial ADCC was invoked by the chimeric antibody FabFc, in which Fab'gamma from mouse antiidiotype is thioether-bonded to human normal Fc gamma. Similar results were obtained on testing LAK cells from a normal donor against uncultured human lymphoma targets coated with native or chimeric antiidiotype. The ADCC invoked by the mouse-human chimeric antibodies appears to depend on the human Fc gamma they display and not on the univalency of the derivatives used. The findings imply that LAK technology could usefully augment serotherapy that uses antibody derivatives displaying human Fc gamma.", "PMC3776789": "Over 600 compounds, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, may cause anticholinergic toxicity. Diagnosis of this potentially fatal condition rests on a detailed history and observation of peripheral and central anticholinergic signs. While supportive therapy is sufficient in most patients, some require treatment with physostigmine. Patient education, judicious drug selection and regular reviews of patients' medications will reduce the risk of anticholinergic toxicity.", "PMC4278257": "At least one additional cardiac lesion was present in 18 consecutive patients with ruptured aneurysms of the sinuses of Valsalva who were investigated between 1956 and 1973 at the University of Alberta Hospital. Clinical diagnosis was made in 78% (14/18) of the patients. Confirmation at cardiac catheterization, operation or autopsy was obtained in all but one. The main sites of rupture were the right ventricle (seven cases), right atrium (five) and left ventricle (five). Fifty percent (9/18) are alive and well following prompt operative repair, an average of 8.2 years later (range, six months to 15 years). Replacement of the aortic valve was associated with a high mortality (50% early, 13% late, total 63%) which could be explained by the higher operative risk in this group of very ill patients. Eight patients (44.4%) had had bacterial endocarditis prior to presentation and this may have played a significant role in the rupture of the sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.", "PMC3612102": "Fifty-six foster children from a public metropolitan social service agency and a comparable group of fifty-six nonfoster children from the same community completed the Nowicki Strickland Internal-External Locus of Control Scale and a brief demographic questionnaire. Results indicated a statistically significant difference in external control orientation for female foster children but not for males as compared to their nonfoster counterparts. The difference was present regardless of the number of years in foster care. Data suggest that placement into foster care and its precipitating events impact on locus of control orientation of female foster children.", "PMC3609017": "Two-dimensional 1H-NMR methods have been used to assign side-chain resonances for the tryptophan residues and for several amino acids located in the heme pockets of the carbon monoxide complexes of the major monomeric hemoglobins from Glycera dibranchiata. The NMR spectra reveal a high degree of conservation of the heme pocket structure in the different hemoglobins. However some conformational differences are evident and residues at positions B10 and G8 on the distal side of the heme pocket are not conserved. From the present NMR studies it appears that the monomeric G. dibranchiata hemoglobin examined by X-ray crystallography [Padlan, E. A. & Love, W. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4067-4078] corresponds to HbC. Except that the orientation of the heme in solution is the reverse of that reported in the crystal structure, there is a close correspondence between the heme pocket structure in the crystal and in solution. The proximal histidine coordination geometry is almost identical in the CO complexes of the three monomeric hemoglobins studied. Distal residues are strongly implicated in determining the observed kinetic differences in ligand binding reactions. In particular, steric crowding of the ligand binding site in hemoglobin A is probably a major factor in the slower kinetics of this component.", "PMC3213113": "Priapism is a rare urologic disease, which is characterized by a pathological, increasingly painful permanent erection of the penis, is appearing without sexual sensations and does not recede spontaneously. The cavernous bodies are affected, not, however, the corpus spongiosum penis and the glans penis. A permanent loss of the erection caused by fibrosation of the trabeculae in the corpora cavernosa is the main complication of the disease. At the instance of 16 cases of the disease conservative and operative methods of therapy are discussed and described as method of choice the cavernosoglandular shunt of puncture after Ebbehoj/Winter is described.

However, in the present experiments hydrocortisone had no effect on the plasma choline concentration of mice, guinea-pigs and rabbits. The protective effect of hydrocortisone against the toxic effects of hemicholinium in mice which was described previously cannot, therefore, be attributed to changes in the concentration of plasma choline.", "PMC3682188": "The effects of sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) on the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and the mechanical function of the isolated ischemic rat heart were investigated. Ischemia was induced by restriction of coronary flow. Perfusion with DCA caused a decrease in the tension developed (DT) and the maximal rate of tension development (+ dT/dt max), and an increase in the resting tension (RT) at low flow rates (0.6 and 0.15 ml/min). However, it did not affect the DT or +dT/dt max of normoxic hearts (3 ml/min) or hearts at zero flow rate. DCA increased PDH activity in hearts at all flow rates. It was concluded that this effect of DCA was associated with a decrease in lactate production, rather than an increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio.", "PMC2939891": "Augmentation of proliferative activity of spleen cells from (CBA X C57BL/6)F1 mice was demonstrated in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction on day 3 after partial hepatectomy, with the decrease of proliferative response observed on day 10 after operation. The decrease was due to the activity of suppressor cells in the spleen of hybrid mice. The immune response of mice in graft-versus-host reaction as well as cytotoxicity of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes were also reduced on days 10-11 after partial hepatectomy.", "PMC3782497": "The sequence of axonal outgrowth and the early cell body positions of identifiable types of reticulospinal (RS) neurons of the zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) were determined in order to learn if differences in neuronal characteristics among specific cell types correlate with differences in the times at which the cells develop. The time of axonal outgrowth and the location of the cells in the developing embryo were determined by filling RS neurons retrogradely with horseradish peroxidase from their growing axons over a series of developmental stages. Hindbrain cells developed in two distinct waves separated by about 10 hours. In the first wave, axons initiating growth at nearly the same time and from nearly the some location in the hindbrain diverged in their choice of an ipsilateral or contralateral pathway into the spinal cord. Individual types of RS neurons grew axons into the rostral spinal cord in a similar temporal sequence to that of their birthdays although the lag time between birthday and time of axonal outgrowth was variable (RS neuronal birthdays were reported in the previous paper, Mendelson: J. Comp. Neurol., 251:160-171 1986). All RS somata were initially observed along the ventral surface of the brain and were subsequently displaced dorsally. The displacement could be passive, due to growth of the ventral hindbrain, and could explain the previously observed dorsoventral differences in RS neuronal time of origin.", "PMC3116532": "A total of 46 boys aged 11 to 13 with the abnormal puberty syndrome were examined. The authors assessed various methods of correction of delayed puberty by the time course of anthropometric and genitometric indices and blood testosterone, LH and FSH levels 1 year after the initiation of treatment, at the age of 14 to 16 and 17 to 19. The ejaculate composition of 12 adolescents over 17 was examined. In 3/4 of the adolescents the indices of physical development and pubescence, blood testosterone and gonadotropic hormone levels achieved physiological values by the age of 14-16, but in 1/4 of the patients delayed puberty with lowered FSH and testosterone levels and raised LH in the blood was noted. The normalization of puberty was noted at the age of 17 to 19 with normal spermatogenesis. The necessity and methods of therapeutic correction of delayed puberty in boys and adolescents with the abnormal puberty syndrome were discussed.", "PMC4096221": "The authors review the main postoperative complications of oto-neuro-surgical techniques, in particular those concerning CSF leak.

Finally we draw conclusions on the structure of the photosystem II reaction centre from plants and discuss the aspects of membrane protein structure.

The lymphocytes of the peripheral blood of 5 healthy relatives as well as of the child with the treated ganglioneuroblastoma failed to show a constant alteration of chromosomes.

These cases include 503 children under the age of 13, of whom 80% were thought to have been affected through perinatal transmission. The prevalence of AIDS-related complex and human immunodeficiency virus in the United States is far greater than these numbers. The CDC has recommended screening those pregnant women with risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus. With the help of a wide range of professionals, we have developed a screening protocol for human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy.

To reevaluate the effect of cycling temperatures on fish metabolism, oxygen consumption was measured in goldfish acclimated to either a constant temperature (28 degrees C) or a diurnal sinewave cycle (20-36 degrees C). Fish from both acclimation conditions were tested at one of three temperatures (20, 28, 36 degrees C). Oxygen consumption increased with temperature but did so independently of the acclimation regime. Thus, cyclic acclimation did not alter metabolic sensitivity.", "PMC4969605": "A variant of Neisseria meningitidis was found to carry a mutator factor which endowed the bacteria with generalized genetic instability. The reversion frequencies of several biochemical mutants were increased up to 1,000-fold when the factor was introduced. The factor is not unidirectional in preference, since the mutator induced mutants generally reverted with increased frequency in its presence. There could be found no indication of insufficient synthesis of nucleic acid precursors. Attempts to demonstrate an unusual, mutagenic base incorporated in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were negative. Strains carrying the mutator factor had significantly increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light. A mutation to a more ultraviolet-resistant type coincided with a disappearance of the mutator property. The presence of the mutator factor in a competent strain resulted in a reduction of the transformation frequency to between 0.5 and 5% of that in the parental strain. A mutation to the more ultraviolet-resistant type resulted in simultaneous loss of the mutator property and reestablishment of a normal transformation efficiency. It has been suggested that this mutator factor may represent a defect in the DNA repair mechanism, which is also of importance for genetic recombination. The mutator factor showed cotransformation with the locus for streptomycin resistance, but a true linkage could not be proved.", "PMC3356298": "1. The polysaccharide and glycolipid composition in Tritrichomonas foetus was studied by paper, thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. 2.

The average duration of follow-up was 12.8 years. Corrections of the coronal curves through instrumentation were satisfactory. However, a kyphosis was produced at the fused segment of the lumbar spine in more than half of the cases. The unfused intervertebral spaces distally were hypermobile in extension, which probably indicated early disc degeneration. The incidences of back pain and radiological degeneration were found to be low. There was no relationship between back symptoms and type of employment, pregnancies or radiological degeneration.

The IOP remained constant in groups 1 and 2 until the administration of suxamethonium when it rose significantly; this rise was maintained during tracheal intubation. In group 3 IOP increased on administering atracurium and a further increase was seen during tracheal intubation. Diagnostic intra-ocular pressure measurements should be made during spontaneous breathing prior to tracheal intubation.

The human DNA sequences present in primary, secondary, and tertiary NIH 3T3 transformants encompass about 32 kilobases (kb) and contain four rearrangements with respect to normal human DNA and a portion of the c-fms protooncogene (FMS in human gene nomenclature). However, the minimal transforming region (6.6 kb) identified in our cloned DNA borders on the c-fms DNA region but does not contain c-fms coding sequences. The fms sequences are also not represented in the two transcripts (approximately equal to 1.2 and 3.5 kb) detected in NIH 3T3 transformants; however, they might provide elements regulating expression. Hybridization to several known oncogene probes and preliminary sequencing data indicate that we have identified a previously unrecognized \"activated\" oncogene. Since the rearrangements present in our cloned DNA sequences are not detectable in the original Kaposi tumor DNA used for transfection, it is possible that this oncogene was generated during gene transfer.", "PMC3777934": "Strains of Pseudomonas stutzeri (CINNS) and Pseudomonas putida (CINNP and CINNW) isolated from soil with cinnamic acid as the sole carbon source were found to be simultaneously adapted to grow on phenylpropionic and p-hydroxybenzoic acids.

Features associated with higher transformation rates were: higher values of blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow; serum haptoglobin; vitamin B12; megakaryocytes in bone marrow; morphological abnormalities in granulo- or megakaryocyte series; male sex; circulating megakaryocytes in peripheral blood; older age; and lower ringed sideroblast proportion. Multivariate analysis was also performed using the following predictor variables: presence or absence of refractory anemia with excess of blasts; sex; abnormal granules in granulocytes; age; and mononuclear large megakaryocytes. Patients were divided arbitrarily into low (hazard ratio, less than 0.45), intermediate (hazard ratio, 0.45-1.85) and high (hazard ratio, greater than 1.85) risk groups. The cumulative leukemia-free rates in the low and intermediate risk groups showed long plateau phases at 95 and 71%, respectively, while in the high risk group, the rate was 10% at 5 years. For clinical purposes, the low risk group should be considered to have nonpreleukemia and the high risk group to have preleukemia.", "PMC3293876": "The buccal absorption of flurbiprofen was studied in normal men to quantify the transport from the oral cavity in humans and to evaluate the closed-perfusion cell apparatus as a means to study drug transport across externally accessible biologic membranes. Flurbiprofen was buccally absorbed by a passive diffusional mechanism and the rate of absorption was pH dependent. Membrane permeability coefficients for flurbiprofen were 4.3 x 10(-4) cm/sec at pH 5.5 and 2.1 x 10(-5) cm/sec at pH 7.0. These findings are in agreement with the pH relationship for buccal transport observed in dog experiments. Delineation of the effective permeability coefficients into components for the aqueous boundary layer and the lipoidal buccal membrane allowed for the prediction of the extent of absorption of the drug over a period of time. It was concluded that the buccal membranes of the human and dog were essentially lipoidal membranes with equivalent permeabilities and no evident aqueous pore pathways.", "PMC3864932": "Heterozygotes of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) can, in certain parts of the world, represent a significant proportion of the population. Epidemiological studies suggest that they are more cancer prone than normal individuals. Fibroblasts of five AT heterozygotes are significantly more sensitive to gamma irradiation (mean D0 = 1.18 Gy) than five normals (mean D0 = 1.49 Gy) although some overlap in response is observed. Experiments designed to maximize differences in survival by allowing a period for the repair of potentially lethal damage (PLD) showed that only one out of five AT heterozygotes was defective in the repair of PLD. This technique does not, therefore, permit an improved discrimination of AT heterozygotes. Two AT heterozygotes were tested for their ability to repair lesions that give rise to micronuclei. Both, like the homozygote, were seen to be defective in this capacity. Defects in the repair of chromosome damage may permit a cellular discrimination of the heterozygotes.", "PMC3608611": "Two solderers exposed to fumes of galvanized metal reported a history of shortness of breath and fever which occurred during the evening and night of days spent at work.

This study employs a canine model in which an ileal segment is interposed between one kidney and the urinary bladder. Comparison of urinary solute excretion rates between the normal and interposed renal units allows quantitation of solute reabsorption and secretion by the ileal segment. Ileal segments reabsorb urinary chloride, potassium, and ammonium. Ammonium is reabsorbed in part as its conjugate free base, ammonia, with the liberated hydrogen ion reabsorbed with chloride or excreted as titratable acid. Inability to excrete acid as ammonium results in depletion of body buffers and a diminished capacity to compensate an additional acid challenge. Bicarbonate is secreted by the ileal segments but not in amounts that are physiologically significant. Impaired renal function predisposes to the development of this syndrome but is not a primary pathophysiologic mechanism.", "PMC2698982": "The potential risk of an electric air hand dryer contributing to airborne infection in a hospital was investigated using a strain of Serratia marcescens and a strain of coagulase-negative, streptomycin-resistant Staphylococcus. Dispersal of marker bacteria by the air dryer was demonstrated within a radius of about 3 feet from the dryer and to the investigator's laboratory coat. When paper towels were used for hand drying, no dispersal of marker bacteria was demonstrated. It is suggested that air hand dryers are unsuitable for use in critical patient care areas as they may contribute to cross infection either via airborne dissemination or via contaminated personnel.", "PMC1919483": "An extremely rare case of sudden death caused by cardiac rupture due to severe fatty infiltration in the right ventricular myocardium is presented.

Scans were obtained by injecting 1-2 mCi of technetium-labeled albumin macroaggregates as the lambs were ventilated with air, with 10-14% O2 in N2, or with air while receiving angiotensin II intravenously. We found that both alveolar hypoxia and infusion of angiotensin II increased pulmonary vascular resistance and redistributed blood flow from the mid and lower lung regions towards the upper posterior region of the lung. We assessed the effects of angiotensin II infusion on filtration pressure in six lambs by measuring the rate of lung lymph flow and the protein concentration of samples of lung lymph. We found that angiotensin II infusion increased pulmonary arterial pressure 50%, lung lymph flow 90%, and decreased the concentration of protein in lymph relative to plasma. These results are identical to those seen when filtration pressure increases during alveolar hypoxia. We conclude that alveolar hypoxia and angiotensin II infusion both increase fluid filtration in the lung by increasing filtration pressure. The increase in filtration pressure may be the result of a redistribution of blood flow in the lung with relative overperfusion of vessels in some areas and transmission of the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure to fluid-exchanging sites in those vessels.", "PMC3924879": "Cefpiramide (HR-810), ceftazidime, piperacillin, ticarcillin, and aztreonam were tested against tobramycin-sensitive and -resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and tobramycin/amikacin-resistant isolates of Ps. cepacia recovered from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis. Against Ps. aeruginosa, none of the drugs inhibited 90% of the test strains at levels of less than 128 mg/l. Median minimal, inhibitory concentrations (MIC50) for all of the beta-lactam agents were lower for tobramycin-sensitive versus tobramycin-resistant isolates of Ps. aeruginosa.

Bacteriol. 92:23-27. 1966.-Washed cell suspensions of Proteus mirabilis, under the proper conditions, stained well with fluorescein isothiocyanate with little or no loss of cell viability. The speed and intensity of the reaction was dependent on both the concentration of dye and pH. Within a range of pH 3.0 to 10.0, staining was most rapid at pH 5.0 to 6.0, with a slower and less intense reaction occurring at the other pH values. As the concentration of dye at either pH 5.0 or 9.0 was increased from 10 to 1,000 mug/ml, there was an increase in the rate of staining but a decrease in cell viability. After 24 hr of incubation at 4 C, pH 5.0, and a dye concentration of 10 mug/ml, all cells were stained, the majority exhibiting intense fluorescence with little or no loss of viability noted.

Significant reductions, of at least 40%, in the numbers of neurons in the ganglia of the myenteric plexus of the 24-month animals were recorded in all regions of the intestine, especially in the colon where the neuron number decreased by over 60%. These figures do not take into account changes that might have occurred in the overall length of the intestine during adult life.

Inactivation is due to alkylation by 2-methylene-3(2H)-furanone, a decomposition product of the enzymic product 3'-keto-2'-deoxyuridine triphosphate. The former has been unambiguously identified as 2-[(ethylthio)methyl]-3(2H)-furanone, an ethanethiol trapped adduct, which is identical by 1H NMR spectroscopy with material synthesized chemically. Subsequent to rapid inactivation, a slow process occurs that results in formation of a new protein-associated chromophore absorbing maximally near 320 nm. The terminal stages of the inactivation have now been investigated in detail. The alkylation and inactivation stoichiometries were studied as a function of the ratio of ClUTP to enzyme. At high enzyme concentrations (0.1 mM), 1 equiv of [5'-3H]ClUTP resulted in 0.9 equiv of 3H bound to protein and 83% inactivation. The amount of labeling of RTPR increased with increasing ClUTP concentration up to the maximum of approximately 4 labels/RTPR, yet the degree of inactivation did not increase proportionally. This suggests that (1) RTPR may be inactivated by alkylation of a single site and (2) decomposition of 3'-keto-dUTP is not necessarily enzyme catalyzed. The formation of the new protein chromophore was also monitored during inactivation and found to reach its full extent upon the first alkylation. Thus, out of four alkylation sites, only one appears capable of undergoing the subsequent reaction to form the new chromophore. While chromophore formation was prevented by NaBH4 treatment, the chromophore itself is resistant to reduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3464191": "ADA specification No. 32 for determining the range (elastic limit) of orthodontic wires uses the bending of a wire section treated as a cantilever beam. An alternative method for defining the range of orthodontic wires proposed by Waters (1981) is to wrap wire sections around mandrels of varying diameters and measure the deformation imparted after unwrapping. Four brass mandrels with a total of 46 test diameters ranging from 3.5 to 60.0 mm were used in this study. Wire sections 9 cm in length were rolled on the mandrel with a hand lathe. The mandrel cross section required to produce a predetermined amount of deformation (2 mm arc height for a 5 cm chord) was defined as the yield diameter for that particular wire. No individual wire was tested twice so as to avoid introduction of strain history. Test samples of 488 different orthodontic wires supplied by nine commercial distributors were evaluated (a total of 4,747 samples). Stainless steel wires of identical dimensions had a large variation in range, depending on the state of strain hardening and heat treatment. For example, 0.020 inch round wire had yield diameters ranging from 22.8 mm for Australian special plus orange (TP Laboratories) to 42.9 mm for Nubryte gold (G.A.C. International). Chromium cobalt wires had less range than stainless steel before heat treatment, but increased greatly in range after heat treatment.

The mean age and age range of the groups were similar (114 months and 98 to 132 months, respectively), and the mean period of observation or treatment was 3 years (range 20 to 65 months in control children, 20 to 72 months in those receiving treatment). Statistically highly significant differences (P less than 0.005) were found in the treatment group for dimensions articulare-B point and articulare-1, gonion-B point and gonion-1, occlusal plane length, and posterior border-mandibular incisor distance. Smaller statistically significant differences were observed for the dimension articulare-pogonion, and between the Bolton plane and inferior border of the mandible. The changes appear to affect the relative distances between the anterior structures of the mandible, and articulare and gonion, respectively. The increases observed were between 2 and 3 mm (2.66% to 4.65%); although these values are small in relation to the overall dimensions of the variables investigated, they may significantly affect the clinical result. The most stable dimensions were found to be the posterior border of the mandible, width of the ascending ramus, and the oblique cross section of the mandibular body; these changes varied between 0.19 and 0.43 mm (0.62% to 1.5%).", "PMC4928265": "Influences of estrogen and progesterone on the development of hyperinsulinemia and augmented pancreatic islet insulin secretion during pregnancy were assessed in this study. Groups of female rats were injected subcutaneously for 21 days with varying daily dosages of estradiol benzoate or progesterone in oil. On day 21, pancreatic islets were isolated by a collagenase method. Total insulin secretion was measured after 90-min incubations of 10 islets in buffered medium containing glucose. Higher physiologic dosages of estradiol or progesterone, singly or in combination, significantly increased islet secretion above values of untreated control rats and were comparable to augmented islet responses of term, 3-wk pregnant rats. Diameter and protein content of islets obtained from steroid-treated and pregnant rats exceeded control measurements in these instances. However, 2-hr preincubations of control islets with 1 or 10 mug/ml of either steroid did not influence subsequent glucose-stimulated insulin output. In related studies, plasma insulin responses during 30 min intravenous glucose tolerance tests were significantly above control responses in term-pregnant rats and animals receiving comparable dosages of steroids for 3 wk. Unlike pregnancy or progesterone treatment, estradiol administration alone or with progesterone significantly lowered postchallenge plasma glucose concentrations. These results indicate that estradiol and progesterone contribute to enhanced islet insulin secretion and plasma insulin responses to glucose administration during pregnancy. This change is not acutely produced but can be related to hypertrophy of islets following chronic hormonal administration. Although the data do not distinguish between direct and indirect beta-cytotrophic effects of these sex steroids, metabolic actions of estradiol and progesterone may differ, since estrogen treatment lowers plasma glucose curves following the induction of hyperinsulinemia.", "PMC3269218": "We employed a health status measure to describe the outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis patients over five years. Of the 410 rheumatoid arthritis patients who were originally administered the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS), 299 completed a follow-up five years later. Data were analyzed using nine health status scales, three components of health status, and an overall arthritis impact item. Results for survivors indicated that there were no clinically important deteriorations in any of these measures. In fact, small improvements on most measures were found. The health status changes were similar for patients originally in a clinical trial and for those receiving routine specialty care. Age was found to positively relate to improvements in psychological status and overall arthritis impact, but we were unable to demonstrate any consistent effects of sex, marital status, education, or disease duration. Our results contrast with other studies that have noted major declines over time in the health status of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, level of education was not a major determinant of morbidity in this group. These results suggest that health status in certain patients with rheumatoid arthritis is more stable than previously thought. This has implications for both clinical practice and clinical research in rheumatology.", "PMC3293576": "This paper presents an introduction into basic principles of antiviral therapy. At the outset, the essential features of virus-host cell interactions have been described to facilitate a discussion of possibilities for antiviral therapy. Subsequently, the most important groups of viruses are evaluated according to the underlying mechanisms of replication (Baltimore classification). The rather limited examples of successful antiviral therapy have been documented. Elementary problems remain unresolved: How can viral replication steps be intercepted without afflicting host mechanisms? Finally, hypothetical approaches towards the elimination of persisting viral genomes from the cellular genome have been reviewed.", "PMC4080786": "Egg yolk lecithin is a lipid, frequently been used for the liposome preparation. Such liposomes, however, are sensitive to oxidation and relatively permeable to encapsulated substances. The catalytic hydrogenation of egg yolk lecithin is one possibility to modify the properties mentioned. The authors deal with preparation and characterization of hydrogenated egg yolk lecithin. Liposomes from native and hydrogenated egg yolk lecithin--also in combination with cholesterol--are compared. Liposomes with hydrogenated egg yolk lecithin as phospholipid component exhibit a significantly increased encapsulation capacity and an essentially improved stability. The permeation of electrolytes, carboxyfluorescein and of the cytostatic drug daunorubicin is studied.", "PMC3343227": "Previous studies have indicated that at least part of the selection of proteins for degradation takes place at a binding site on ubiquitin-protein ligase, to which the protein substrate is bound prior to ligation to ubiquitin. It was also shown that proteins with free NH2-terminal alpha-NH2 groups bind better to this site than proteins with blocked NH2 termini (Hershko, A., Heller, H., Eytan, E., and Reiss, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11992-11999). In the present study, we used simple derivatives of amino acids, such as methyl esters, hydroxamates, or dipeptides, to examine the question of whether the protein binding site of the ligase is able to distinguish between different NH2-terminal residues of proteins. Based on specific patterns of inhibition of the binding to ligase by these derivatives, three types of protein substrates could be distinguished. Type I substrates are proteins that have a basic NH2-terminal residue (such as ribonuclease and lysozyme); these are specifically inhibited by derivatives of the 3 basic amino acids (His, Arg, and Lys) with respect to degradation, ligation to ubiquitin, and binding to ligase. Type II substrates (such as beta-lactoglobulin or pepsinogen, that have a Leu residue at the NH2 terminus) are not affected by the above compounds, but are specifically inhibited by derivatives of bulky hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Trp, Phe, and Tyr). In these cases, the amino acid derivatives apparently act as specific inhibitors of the binding of the NH2-terminal residue of proteins, as indicated by the following observations: (a) derivatives in which the alpha-NH2 group is blocked were inactive and (b) in dipeptides, the inhibitory amino acid residue had to be at the NH2-terminal position. An additional class (Type III) of substrates comprises proteins that have neither basic nor bulky hydrophobic NH2-terminal amino acid residues; the binding of these proteins is not inhibited by homologous amino acid derivatives that have NH2-terminal residues similar to that of the protein. It is concluded that Type I and Type II proteins bind to distinct and separate subsites of the ligase, specific for basic or bulky hydrophobic NH2-terminal residues, respectively. On the other hand, Type III proteins apparently predominantly interact with the ligase at regions of the protein molecule other than the NH2-terminal residue.", "PMC3623702": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious neonatal disorder of uncertain cause, although fecal bacteria have been implicated in some outbreaks. We examined coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) as possible etiologic agents. In our unit, CONS colonized the bowels of most infants studied, including 46% of 70 NEC cases (mean concentration, 10(9.1) CFU/g of stool). Over 90% of tested isolates produced a hemolysin resembling delta toxin of Staphylococcus aureus. Toxin purified from a NEC-associated isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis resembled reference delta toxin from S. aureus in size, biologic properties, and antigenicity. This delta-like toxin was enteropathic, causing mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage in injected loops of the bowels of infant rats. Adjacent, nonexposed bowel remained normal, as did loops injected with lecithin-neutralized toxin. Using a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we detected delta-like toxin in the stools of 11 of 35 infants colonized with CONS positive for delta-like toxin (Tox+). Positive tests were strongly associated with NEC. Of 18 cases with Tox+ CONS, 10 were positive (56%), whereas only 1 of 17 control infants so colonized was positive (6%, P = 0.002). In NEC patients, the mean fecal toxin concentration was 1,012 ng/g. Toxicity to fibroblasts was demonstrable in filtrates of each of six ELISA-positive samples tested but was absent in all five ELISA-negative samples tested. We conclude that delta-like toxin is elaborated in the bowels of some infants with Tox+ CONS, and its association with NEC suggests that such CONS are enteropathic. In our unit, this mechanism was apparent in 23% of 44 recent cases of endemic NEC.", "PMC3108252": "Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were employed to define the structures of Neisseria gonorrhoeae peptidoglycan monomers that were of interest because of their abilities to mediate diverse biological reactions ranging from arthritogenicity to somogenicity. FABMS-determined molecular weights of individual components present in several different enzymatically derived classes of gonococcal monomers revealed that each of these classes was a complex mixture of up to 13 distinct peptidoglycan fragments. These ranged from the predominant disaccharide tetrapeptides possessing reducing or nonreducing 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid ends to relatively minor constituents containing glycine or asparagine in addition to traditional peptidoglycan amino acids, i.e. alanine, glutamic acid, and diaminopimelic acid. FABMS of high performance liquid chromatography-purified monomers yielded some sequence information; however, analysis even of unfractionated peptidoglycan mixtures using a JEOL HX110/HX110 tandem mass spectrometer operating at 10 kV provided unambiguous primary sequence data for the peptidoglycan monomers and defined the position of glycine in four compounds as well as the location of O-acetyl substituents (present on some compounds) on C-6 of the N-acetylmuramic acid residue.", "PMC2765204": "The imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro15-4513, has been shown to antagonize some of the behavioral effects of ethanol (ETOH). In rats having relatively little experience in the open field, the actions of ETOH (0.75 g/kg IP), Ro15-4513 (1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg, IP), and Ro15-4513 in combination with ETOH were measured on horizontal activity. Rats receiving ETOH showed a significant depression in horizontal activity. Doses of Ro15-4513 given alone produced no significant differences in activity from baseline levels. Rats pretreated with Ro15-4513 prior to receiving ETOH, however, showed a significant attenuation of the ETOH induced depression of activity. These results indicate that Ro15-4513 is effective in attenuating the depressive effects of ETOH in the open field in rats having little experience in the apparatus.", "PMC3315304": "PIVKA-II (Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence) is abnormal des-carboxylated prothrombin, which is present in vitamin K deficiency or in patients using warfarin. With a sensitive method for PIVKA-II, biochemical vitamin K deficiency can be established before clinical symptoms occur. We give an overview of methods used to detect PIVKA-II, and four selected methods are inter-compared: (a) measuring total factor II including PIVKA-II by using Echis carinatus snake venom as an activator of prothrombin; (b) measuring PIVKA-II by using snake venom as an activator of factor II after adsorption of functional factor II onto barium sulfate; (c) electrophoresis-immunofixation method; and (d) enzyme immunoassay. We found d to be the most sensitive and reliable method for PIVKA-II.", "PMC3851700": "The anticancer drugs adriamycin (ADR) and actinomycin D (AMD) were tested for their effect on the oxidative burst (OB) of mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) and on the killing of tumor cells by OB-stimulated MPM. The oxidative burst of MPM determined by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production was severely impaired by ADR (10 micrograms/ml) and AMD (40 micrograms/ml) after a 1 h treatment and by lower concentrations of the drugs following a 24 h treatment. The toxicity of the drugs against MPM was comparable to their effect on EL4 cells. Pretreatment of EL4 and TLX-9 tumor cells with sublethal amounts of ADR for 4 h rendered the cells sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of OB-stimulated MPM which were otherwise unable to kill these cells. It seems that anticancer drugs and OB-stimulated macrophages can cooperate in the destruction of tumor cells in vitro.", "PMC2808185": "Selective plating procedures were used to follow the fate of rifampicin-resistant mutant strains of the obligately anaerobic species Bacteroides multiacidus and Selenomonas ruminantium after their introduction at numbers around 10(7)/ml into the rumen of sheep. Bacteroides multiacidus strain F100 showed an initially rapid rate of loss (49%/h) but subsequently numbers declined more gradually approaching the limits of detection (less than 10(3)/ml) after 100 h. Viable cell numbers also decreased in vitro upon addition of F100 cells to whole rumen contents, but remained stable upon addition to cell-free rumen fluid, suggesting protozoal predation. F100 cells were able to grow in vitro in whole rumen contents in the presence of an added utilizable substrate such as sorbitol, but addition of sorbitol to the rumen failed to enhance survival in vivo. In the case of S. ruminantium, introduced rifR strains persisted in the rumen at levels around 10(6) ml for at least 30 days.", "PMC3838816": "Samples of adrenal medullary phaeochromocytoma from two patients were extracted in acid. The tissue concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like immunoreactivity were found to be 0.94 and 8.11 micrograms/g. Plasma from these patients subjected to NPY radioimmunoassay after Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography revealed circulating plasma concentrations of 1889 and 2079 pg/ml, compared to levels in normal plasma of less than 50 pg/ml, treated in the same way. Further characterisation of this plasma NPY-like immunoreactivity by HPLC showed this peptide to possess identical elution behaviour to human NPY standard. It is suggested that circulating NPY may be a contributory factor in the symptoms exhibited by some patients with adrenal medullary phaeochromocytoma.", "PMC3265145": "Ion-sensitive microelectrodes and current-voltage analysis were used to study intracellular pH (pHi) regulation and its effects on ionic conductances in the isolated epithelium of frog skin. We show that pHi recovery after an acid load is dependent on the operation of an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger localized at the basolateral cell membranes. The antiporter is not quiescent at physiological pHi (7.1-7.4) and, thus, contributes to the maintenance of steady state pHi. Moreover, intracellular sodium ion activity is also controlled in part by Na+ uptake via the exchanger. Intracellular acidification decreased transepithelial Na+ transport rate, apical Na+ permeability (PNa) and Na+ and K+ conductances. The recovery of these transport parameters after the removal of the acid load was found to be dependent on pHi regulation via Na+/H+ exchange. Conversely, variations in Na+ transport were accompanied by changes in pHi. Inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase by ouabain produced covariant decreases in pHi and PNa, whereas increases in Na+ transport, occurring spontaneously or after aldosterone treatment, were highly correlated with intracellular alkalinization. We conclude that cytoplasmic H+ activity is regulated by a basolateral Na+/H+ exchanger and that transcellular coupling of ion flows at opposing cell membranes can be modulated by the pHi-regulating mechanism.", "PMC3162007": "During metamorphosis in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, muscles of the abdominal body wall undergo a reorganization. Many die at the end of larval life and are replaced in the adult by newly generated muscles. We have identified several of the motoneurons innervating these muscles and followed them through metamorphosis. The morphology of larval motoneurons is correlated with their target location. Those with medial targets have bilateral dendritic fields, whereas those with lateral targets have dendrites restricted to one side of the segmental ganglion. Some motoneurons innervate the same muscle in all stages of life, but the majority lose their larval targets following entry into the pupal stage. Although some of the latter group also die at this time, most survive to innervate a new adult target. These \"respecified\" motoneurons undergo a period of dramatic dendritic growth during metamorphosis. The results demonstrate that these identified neurons are capable, under the appropriate conditions of existing in more than one stable morphology.", "PMC4095001": "We present a case with extensive bone and joint involvement in the form of bone fragmentation and osteochondritis dessecans.

Doses of 200 mg were given to each of the volunteers in a randomized, crossover manner 1 week apart orally and as a 10-min intravenous infusion. Half-lives (mean +/- standard deviation) for the intravenous and oral administration arms were 4.2 +/- 0.77 and 4.11 +/- 0.74 h, respectively. The serum clearance rate averaged 28.5 +/- 4.7 liters/h per 1.73 m2 for the intravenous administration arm. The renal clearance rate accounted for approximately 60% of the corresponding serum clearance rate and was 16.9 +/- 3.0 liters/h per 1.73 m2 for the intravenous arm and 17.0 +/- 2.86 liters/h per 1.73 m2 for the oral administration arm. Absorption was rapid, with peak concentrations in serum occurring at 0.71 +/- 0.15 h. Bioavailability, defined as the ratio of the area under the curve from 0 h to infinity for the oral to the intravenous dose, was 69 +/- 7%. We conclude that ciprofloxacin is rapidly absorbed and reliably bioavailable in these healthy volunteers. Further studies with ciprofloxacin should be undertaken in target patient populations under actual clinical circumstances.", "PMC3747130": "In Japan, the age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) for stomach cancer has been decreasing since around 1960 in both sexes. Conversely, the AAMRs for the cancers of the colon, pancreas, gallbladder and bile duct, lung, ovary and prostate have been increasing in the last 30 years. In this period, the amounts of intake of carbohydrate, rice and salted foods have decreased and those of fat, animal protein, meats, eggs, daily products, oils and fruits have markedly increased. Changes of the intake of those nutrients and foods may have contributed to the changes of the AAMR for some sites of cancer.", "PMC3510210": "We have examined the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the isolated plasma membranes of 3T3-F442A adipocytes. Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor is detected readily in the plasma membrane of these cells by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and under nonreducing conditions, the predominant species of phosphorylated insulin receptor has an apparent molecular mass of 350,000 daltons with the beta-subunit (92,000 daltons) being phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the isolated plasma membrane is absolutely dependent on insulin; tyrosine residues and, to a lesser extent, serine residues of the receptor are phosphorylated. Treatment of the plasma membrane with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) has two effects; 1) NEM prevents the formation of a larger form (greater than 350,000 daltons) of the phosphorylated insulin receptor. The formation of this larger form of the receptor involves sulfhydryl oxidation which occurs at 37 degrees C under nondenaturing conditions, but does not occur at 0 degrees C or at room temperature even in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. These results indicate that the larger form of the phosphorylated receptor can occur under physiological conditions and suggest that this process may be relevant to aggregation of the receptor-ligand complex. 2) Prior to treatment with insulin, NEM enhances the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Phosphopeptide analysis indicates that the site(s) of phosphorylation of the receptor is identical in the presence or absence of NEM.", "PMC2262892": "The role of the central noradrenergic systems and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in modulating defensive withdrawal behavior was studied in rats. The apparatus consisted of a small chamber set on one side of a one-meter open field, into which the rat was placed to start the test. When rats were unfamiliar with the apparatus, they displayed species typical defensive withdrawal behavior with long latencies to emerge from and a high proportion of time spent in the small chamber. Intraperitoneal administration of clonidine (0.03 mg/kg), l-propranolol (2.5 micrograms/kg), prazosin (0.1 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg) each significantly decreased the latency to emerge from and the mean time spent in the small chamber (MTIC) and increased the number of chamber entries. When rats were familiar with the apparatus, prior restraint for 20 min significantly increased the latency and MTIC, and decreased the number of chamber entries and rears, but did not alter locomotor activity. Prazosin, clonidine, CDP, l-propranolol and the CRF-antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (25 micrograms i.c.v.), reversed the restraint-induced increase in the latency and MTIC. CRF (10-100 ng i.c.v.) dose-dependently induced defensive withdrawal behavior in rats familiar with the apparatus; the minimum statistically significant dose was 50 ng. dl-Propranolol (5 mg/kg) and CDP blocked the CRF-induced changes in the latency to emerge and the MTIC; whereas clonidine and prazosin significantly reduced the latency, but had no statistically significant effects on the MTIC. Phenylephrine (25-200 ng i.c.v.) dose-dependently induced defensive withdrawal behavior. This effect of phenylephrine (200 ng) was significantly antagonized by prazosin or alpha-helical CRF9-41 (25 or 50 mg i.c.v.), but not by CDP. Our results suggest that the hyperactivity of the central noradrenergic systems caused by exposure to the novel environment may stimulate the release of CRF, which through some unknown mechanism induces defensive withdrawal behavior in rats. Activation of beta adrenergic receptors may also induce defensive withdrawal.", "PMC3522592": "This study was undertaken to evaluate a new osteoinductive material--perforated decalcified bone matrix (PDBM).

Electron diffraction patterns show that DNA within vitrified bacteriophages has a B conformation. Electron micrographs of vitrified bacteriophages show domains within the head formed by a approximately 2.5-nm striation and arising from the DNA packing. The number of differently oriented domains seen within a vitrified bacteriophage depends upon the geometry of the DNA container: the bacteriophage capsid. The packing of DNA within bacteriophages seems then to be governed by at least two phenomena. The first is the tendency of DNA to form local alignments (nematic liquid crystals). The second is the orientation of these liquid crystals by the bacteriophage capsid. From these observations we propose a possible packaging mechanism: constrained nematic crystallization.", "PMC3525568": "In defining the linear extent of a malignant tumor in a long bone, radiographs, computerized tomography, and scintigraphy are routinely employed, especially when non-ablative surgery is being considered. The drawbacks of these modalities in defining the true intracompartmental extent of disease within a bone can largely be overcome with the use of magnetic resonance imaging. We did a prospective analysis of magnetic resonance imaging in sixteen consecutive patients with a primary malignant tumor of a long bone, and it showed that this modality has clinical promise of being more precise than the other modalities in defining the true proximal and distal extent of a tumor in a long bone.

To evaluate the effect of SEPC on venous function in the postoperative patient, pre- and postoperative venous capacitance (VC) and outflow (VO) were measured in a series of general surgical patients. In phase I, 17 limbs were evaluated in patients who had been fully ambulatory preoperatively and at complete bed rest postoperatively. VC decreased from 3.19 +/- 0.43 cc/100 cc of tissue (mean +/- standard error of the mean) preoperatively to 2.08 +/- 0.34 cc/100 cc of tissue postoperatively (p less than 0.05) and VO decreased from 87.2 +/- 10.6 cc/100 cc of tissue/min preoperatively to 58.1 +/- 8.7 cc/100 cc of tissue/min postoperatively (p less than 0.025).

We performed a comprehensive examination of 154 exposed and 155 unexposed persons in the area. There were no consistent differences between the two groups on medical history, physical examination, serum and urinary chemistry studies, and neurologic tests. Results of liver function tests suggested possible subclinical effects. The exposed group had an increased frequency of anergy (11.8% vs 1.1%) and relative anergy (35.3% vs 11.8%). The exposed group also had non-statistically significant increased frequencies of abnormal T-cell subset test results (10.4% vs 6.8%), a T4/T8 ratio of less than 1.0 (8.1% vs 6.4%), and an abnormality in the functional T-cell test results (12.6% vs 8.5%). These findings suggest that long-term exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is associated with depressed cell-mediated immunity, although the effects have not resulted in an excess of clinical illness in the exposed group.

Among ADM-treated rabbits, 8 of 10 showed post-treatment ECG changes; in rabbits treated with ADM and prenylamine, changes were found in a smaller number (5 of 10); and in animals treated with ADM and vitamins A and E, the incidence was only one in six (p less than 0.05). Heart homogenates from ADM-treated rabbits showed an increased hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence (expressed as cpm/mg protein X 10(-3)) of 77 +/- 4 compared to control animals (52 +/- 1) (p less than 0.01). Prenylamine administration did not alter hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence in ADM-treated rabbits, whereas treatment with a combination of vitamins A and E showed a significant decrease in hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence in control (40 +/- 2) and ADM-treated rabbits (42 +/- 1). Microscopically, myocardial fibers had mild to severe hydropic vacuolization of sarcoplasm, which led to progressive myocytolysis. A total of 103 +/- 13 damaged fibers were detected over 700 counted fibers. Myocardial damage was lowered to 47 +/- 16 by administration of prenylamine and to 28 +/- 8 by administration of vitamins A and E. It is suggested that ADM leads to myocardial lipid peroxidation (ameliorated by vitamins A and E) with membrane damage and to an increase in calcium permeability, the latter being counteracted by prenylamine.", "PMC2920843": "In order to study outcome of pregnancy related to timing of conception it is necessary to have both markers of ovulation and records of intercourse. Natural family planning (NFP) charts where the woman records basal body temperature (BBT) and mucus signs are ideal for this purpose. Much work has been done relating timing of BBT and mucus signs to ovulation, but very little work has been done to examine interobserver agreement on the interpretation of these signs. Four NFP experts examined 28 NFP pregnancy charts to determine the BBT rise, the mucus peak, and two most likely days of conception intercourse. The charts were selected because they provided difficulties in interpretation. The reviewers were able to agree on the most probable day of conception intercourse in 96.4% of cases, on the mucus peak in 74.1% of cases, and on the interval between the most probable conception intercourse and mucus peak in 70.4% of cases. There was poor agreement on the first day of the BBT rise (38.5%). The authors conclude that in selected difficult NFP charts, the mucus peak is a more valid indirect measure of ovulation both because it is subject to less interobserver variation and because it more closely approximates the timing of ovulation.", "PMC3585337": "The concentration of naturally synthesized nerve growth factor (NGF) was measured in various tissues of adult rats, using a highly sensitive two-site enzyme immunoassay. The highest concentration was found in the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion (SCG). Transection of the postganglionic external carotid nerve (ECN) reduced the ganglionic level of NGF more than did section of the internal carotid nerve (ICN). When both the preganglionic nerve and the ECN were cut, the ganglionic NGF level decreased even more. On the other hand, when the preganglionic nerve and the ICN were both sectioned, leaving the ECN intact, endogenous NGF content in the SCG was significantly enhanced 3-9 h after operation. Bilateral extirpation of submaxillary gland produced a rapid decrease in ganglionic NGF 3-6 h after operation, and even unilateral removal of one salivary gland caused a decrease in both ganglia, which was however much greater in the ipsi- than in the contralateral ganglion. Removal of the eyeballs caused a much smaller reduction in ganglionic NGF than did removal of the glands. These results suggest that the endogenous NGF that accumulates in the SCG is mostly synthesized in the submaxillary gland rather than in the iris, and that it is transported to the SCG, mostly via the ipsilateral ECN.", "PMC3392103": "Schwann cells have a unique role in regulating the growth of axons during regeneration and presumably during development. Here we show that Schwann cells are the best substrate yet identified for promoting process growth in vitro by peripheral motor neurons. To determine the molecular interactions responsible for Schwann cell regulation of axon growth, we have examined the effects of specific antibodies on process growth in vitro, and have identified three glycoproteins that play major roles. These are the Ca2+-independent cell adhesion molecule (CAM), L1/Ng-CAM; the Ca2+-dependent CAM, N-cadherin; and members of the integrin extracellular matrix receptor superfamily. Two other CAMs present on neurons and/or Schwann cells-N-CAM and myelin-associated glycoprotein-do not appear to be important in regulating process growth. Our results imply that neuronal growth cones use integrin-class extracellular matrix receptors and at least two CAMs--N-cadherin and L1/Ng-CAM-for growth on Schwann cells in vitro and establish each of these glycoproteins as a strong candidate for regulating axon growth and guidance in vivo.", "PMC3975429": "A series of desamino-2-nor-leukotriene analogs has been prepared by the reaction of various thiols with several methyl trans-4,5-epoxy-6Z-alkenoates, followed by deprotection. The products were assessed for their ability to antagonize the LTD4-induced contraction of the isolated guinea pig trachea. Several compounds displayed potent leukotriene antagonist activity, i.e., KB values in the sub-micromolar range, while only minimally affecting basal airway tone. The most potent analog, 4-hydroxy-5-(2-carboxyethylthio)-6Z-nonadecenoic acid, antagonized both LTD4- and LTE4-induced contractions of the trachea in an apparently competitive fashion. These agents possess increased potency relative to SK&F 101132, the first leukotriene analog identified as having LT-antagonist activity. Thus, these results demonstrate that deletion of the peptide amino group can produce leukotriene analogs which have minimal intrinsic contractile activity on the isolated guinea pig trachea, yet possess potent leukotriene-antagonistic effects.", "PMC4537306": "The elastimeter method was applied to the single muscle fiber of the frog semitendinosus to obtain the elastic moduli of the sarcolemma and myoplasm, as well as their relative contributions to resting fiber tension at different extensions. A bleb which was sucked into a flat-mouthed pipette at the fiber surface separated into an external sarcolemmal membrane and a thick inner myoplasmic region. Measurements showed that the sarcolemma does not contribute to intact fiber tension at sarcomere lengths below 3 micro. It was estimated that the sarcolemma contributed on the order of 10% to intact fiber tension at sarcomere lengths between 3 and 3.75 micro, and more so with further extension. Between these sarcomere lengths, the sarcolemma can be linearly extended and has a longitudinal elastic modulus of 5 x 10(6) dyne/cm(2) (assuming a thickness of 0.1 micro). Resistance to deformation of the inner bleb region is due to myoplasmic elasticity. The myoplasmic elastic modulus was estimated by use of a model and was used to predict a fiber length-tension curve which agreed approximately with observations.", "PMC2944783": "We have recently shown that in addition to beta-endorphin the opioid peptides Met- and Leu-enkephalin and their apparent precursors are localized in islet endocrine cells of the rat pancreas. To begin evaluating a possible role for these pancreatic opiates in the pathophysiology of genetic diabetes in rodents, immunoreactive beta-endorphin and Met- and Leu-enkephalins were measured in acetic acid extracts of pancreas and pituitary of C57BL/KsJ db/db mice and their lean littermates. Groups of animals were studied during three phases of development of the diabetic syndrome in the mutant mice: at 4 (hyperinsulinemic and prediabetic); 6, 9, and 12 (frankly obese and diabetic); and 30 (hypoinsulinemic) wk of age. Elevations or decreases (P less than .05) were found in db/db mice (vs. lean littermates) as follows: pituitary content of Met-enkephalin was twofold higher at all ages studied; pituitary free Leu-enkephalin was lower at 4 wk and reversed to higher at 6-30 wk; pancreatic beta-endorphin was 30% lower at 4 wk and reversed to threefold higher at 6-12 wk; Met- and Leu-enkephalin-containing larger peptides were elevated at one or more points between 6 and 12 wk in both the pancreas and the pituitary. Thus, the onset of overt obesity between 4 and 6 wk of age was accompanied by a marked rise in both pancreatic beta-endorphin and pituitary Leu-enkephalin; similar elevations in these parameters have been reported previously in C57BL/6J ob/ob mice at approximately 12 wk of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PMC3400276": "1. The effect of activated charcoal beads on the faecal excretion of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PenCDF), a causal agent of yusho, which accumulates in the body, was studied for 12 weeks in rats. 2. Diets supplemented with 1% and 5% activated charcoal beads stimulated faecal excretion of PenCDF about 2- and 4-fold, respectively. The concentration of PenCDF in liver, the major storage site, was decreased significantly and dose-dependently by the treatment. 3. The charcoal bead treatment decreased the extent of fatty liver, thymic atrophy, and induction of hepatic benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase.", "PMC3236211": "To clarify the diuretic response to furosemide in a diseased state, the urinary excretion of furosemide, water, and electrolytes was examined after a single intravenous injection of furosemide in control rats and rats with mild acute renal failure (ARF) induced by glycerol. The urinary recovery of furosemide was similar in the control and ARF rats. However, the diuretic response to furosemide was increased in ARF rats compared with control rats. Although the relationship between the urine flow rate (UFR) and the urinary excretion rate of (Na+ + K+) (UV Na + K) was the same in both groups, the urinary excretion rate of K+ (UV K) was decreased in ARF rats. The concentrating ability in ARF rats was also decreased compared with that in control rats. By infusion of aldosterone in ARF rats, both UV K and the concentrating ability were increased and the diuretic response to furosemide was decreased, whereas the relationship between UFR and UV Na + K was not changed. Therefore, it is concluded that the increased diuretic response to urinary excretion of furosemide in ARF rats may be caused, at least in part, by the decreased concentrating ability along the nephron.", "PMC3985869": "Two broiler flocks contained 0.5 and 3% small chickens. The small chickens were approximately one-third the size of their penmates, were very active, and retained much of their chick down. They had distended abdomens with full intestinal tracts, often containing undigested feed. In many, the pancreases were thin, white, and firm because of loss of exocrine tissue and replacement by fibrous tissue. Many had skeletal changes suggestive of rickets. In a survey of 48 broiler flocks for small birds and pancreatic lesions, five flocks had a noticeable incidence of small chickens, varying from less than 1% to a maximum of 2%. In 33 of the flocks surveyed, a low incidence of pancreatic lesions was found in birds at the processing plant. No correlation was found between a noticeable number of small birds at the farm and pancreatic lesions found at processing.", "PMC4072726": "Nonsuppression on the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in schizophrenics has been reported by three independent groups. To elucidate the significance of this finding a schizophrenic cohort was tested on a wide range of parameters: computed tomography (CT), electroencephalography (EEG), the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery (HRB), platelet monoamine oxidase activity (MAO), serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase levels (DBH), premorbid personality adjustment, response to medication and family history of mental illness. Our results indicate that DST nonsuppressing and DST suppressing schizophrenics are no different on any of these measures, lending support to the notion that DST nonsuppression in schizophrenics is a random and changing event.", "PMC3236219": "Using the hair baiting technique, 6 genera and 14 species were collected on Sabouraud's dextrose agar from 37 dust samples from air-conditioners.

Patients were followed up for a period of 10.2 years (mean 6.1 years). Amassed clinical exposure amounted to 5465 patient years. Mean BP fell from 183.0 +/- 1.0/109.2 +/- 0.5 mmHg to 145.1 +/- 0.6/89.3 +/- 0.3 mmHg and treatment resulted in a significant regression of the electrocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Side effects of treatment were consistent with those expected from a regime comprising a combination of a beta 1 selective hydrophilic beta-blocker, diuretics and vasodilators. Reported side effects appeared to diminish with time; were more common in the elderly than in the young and increased in frequency as the dose of atenolol increased. Biochemical disturbance was minimal. Total mortality (n = 91) and mortality from myocardial infarction (n = 40) were positively related to treated systolic blood pressure (SBP). A J-shaped curvilinear relationship between treated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and death rate from myocardial infarction has been shown. Although the number of deaths from stroke was small (n = 21), there appeared to be a positive relationship with treated DBP: by contrast the data suggest that in the elderly, lowering SBP to below about 140 mmHg might be associated with an increased incidence of death from stroke.", "PMC2987836": "Genomic and cDNA clones of the X. laevis src gene have been isolated and characterized by hybridization and DNA sequence analyses. The haploid genome of X. laevis contains two src genes, which can be distinguished from one another by virtue of sequence divergence in the 3' untranslated regions. Both of the genes are functional as indicated by the fact that oocytes contain RNAs transcribed from each of the genes. The two genes each encode an RNA which is 3.3 kb in length, or twice the length required to encode the 60,000 dalton src protein (pp60). Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones revealed that nearly all of the non-coding sequence is located at the 3' end.

To further examine this, we identified 74 patients who were diagnosed as having infective endocarditis over a 54-month period. The 50 patients who underwent 2DE examination form the basis of this report. Definite vegetations were present in 21 (42%) patients and measured 1.2 +/- 0.2 cm2. The vegetation was localized to the aortic valve in 10 patients, the mitral valve in eight, and the tricuspid valve in three. A major complication, defined as death, new-onset congestive heart failure, major arterial embolus, or valve surgery occurred in 86% of the vegetative endocarditis patients compared to 62% of those without vegetations. Among those patients with vegetations, death occurred in 24%, heart failure in 38%, arterial embolus in 48%, and surgery in 43%. This compared to 7%, 21%, 21%, and 24%, respectively, in those patients without vegetations. These data support the concept that 2DE detection of a vegetation defines a high-risk subgroup of patients with infective endocarditis in whom careful monitoring and aggressive management are warranted.", "PMC3734052": "The kinetics of the elongation reaction in the polymerization of actin containing tightly-bound Mg2+ (Mg-actin) or tightly-bound Ca2+ (Ca-actin) have been studied. The reaction was monitored using the increase in fluorescence intensity of N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide-labelled monomeric actin as a measure of polymer formation. The actin nucleation reaction was circumvented by the addition of phalloidin-stabilized actin nuclei. Elongation rates were obtained at various actin concentrations and at various temperatures for polymerization induced by the presence of different monovalent and divalent salt concentrations. Values for the relative rate constant of forward polymerization (mk+) for Mg-actin were found to be larger than those for Ca-actin under similar conditions (m = number of polymer ends). The critical actin concentration (Cc) of Mg-actin is lower than the Cc for Ca-actin, as were estimates of the relative rate constant of depolymerization (mk-). The temperature dependence of Cc, mk+ and mk- for Mg-actin was different from that for Ca-actin, further suggesting a difference in monomeric properties due to the type of divalent cation tightly bound to actin. Estimates of the activation enthalpy change for the forward reaction in the G in equilibrium F transformation were similar for both types of actin, but the activation enthalpy change for the depolymerization of Mg-actin was significantly larger than that for Ca-actin.", "PMC2987838": "A region located upstream of the uvrB promoters P1 and P2 was found to cause high plasmid loss when cloned in multicopy vectors. Two sequence elements responsible for this phenomenon were identified by mapping of spontaneous mutations that restore plasmid maintenance: a sequence known to have in vitro promoter activity and a partially overlapping sequence that shows extensive homology to recognition sites for the DnaA protein. Accordingly alterations in the level of DnaA protein in vivo were found to affect the extent of plasmid loss. A possible role for interaction of the DnaA protein with the region of interest is discussed in relation to regulation of uvrB expression.", "PMC3411606": "The chick chromosomal gene for calbindin (the 28,000 Mr intestinal calcium-binding protein) was cloned, and all the exons and flanking regions were sequenced. The promoter region contains typical ATAAA and GGGCGG boxes, the latter being unusual in \"non-housekeeping\" genes. Three polyadenylation signals are found in the calbindin gene that correspond to the three known mRNAs. Transcription termination is not efficient because homology with consensus sequences found downstream from the polyadenylation signal is weak. There are ten introns, most of which do not fall at homologous positions, neither with respect to the sixfold repeating structure of the calbindin protein, nor with respect to previously sequenced genes for calmodulin and other calcium-binding proteins. The gene for the related protein calretinin was cloned and partially sequenced. The introns are in the same positions in the calretinin and calbindin genes. The introns have apparently been inserted during the divergence of the calcium-binding protein superfamily.", "PMC3675214": "A rare case of head accretion of monozygotic girl-twins 6 years of age has been investigated.

These occurred in hyperacute EAE induced by inoculation with guinea pig spinal cord homogenate and heat-killed Bordetella pertussis. Hypothermia was first detected on day 6-7 post-inoculation, within 12-24 h of the onset of neurological signs, and became more severe as the disease progressed. Rectal temperatures less than or equal to 30 degrees C were common at ambient temperatures of 19-22 degrees C. Shivering was assessed by palpation and by cold tremor electromyography. Shivering was absent in the tail by day 6-7 post-inoculation. The impairment then progressed to affect the hindlimbs, thorax and occasionally the forelimbs. Shivering was absent in hindlimbs with only mild or moderate weakness. Histological studies revealed perivascular inflammation with polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells, oedema, fibrin deposition, haemorrhage, primary demyelination and axonal degeneration in the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia and spinal roots. The brainstem was also involved but the cerebral hemispheres, including the hypothalamus, were spared. The close relationship between the severity of hypothermia and the extent of shivering impairment indicates that reduced shivering is an important cause of hypothermia in hyperacute EAE. It is concluded that this impairment of shivering is due not to hypothalamic damage but to lesions elsewhere in the central and peripheral nervous systems.", "PMC3713266": "The life durations of hypo- and hyperthyroid Wistar rats were measured under clean conventional conditions. The amount of exogenous T4 (thyroxine), which is sufficient to elevate T4 levels in the blood, decreased with age. The rats which were made hypothyroid by the neonatal T4 treatment had a longer lifespan than control. The lifespans of hyperthyroid rats, to which T4 solutions were given as drinking water during either the first or the second half of the life period, were shorter than control. The life-shortening effect of T4 was not detected when T4 was administered to already aged animals. These results indicate that the effect of T4 administration is not due to the direct promotion of the diseases which cause the death, but to the acceleration of aging during the young or middle-aged period.", "PMC4030872": "From July 1972 through July 1983, 360 consecutive patients 70 years of age and older (mean age 74.1; range 70-88 years) underwent 362 valve replacement procedures. There were 122 isolated aortic valve replacements (33.7%; Group I); 70 isolated mitral valve replacements (19.3%; Group II); and 170 patients had combined procedures (47.0%; Group III), which included the replacement of at least one valve. Eighteen patients (5.0%) had previous cardiac surgery. Thirty-two patients (8.8%) were operated as emergencies. Three hundred and thirty-two (86.5%) of all valves implanted were porcine heterografts. Pre-operatively, over one-half (53.6%) of the patients were in New York Heart Association Functional Class IV. The overall hospital mortality was 13.8% (50 patients). The aortic valve mortality was 11.5%, the mitral valve mortality was 15.7%, and the combined procedures 14.7%. The follow-up period for hospital survivors (312 patients) extended from 2 weeks to 127.2 months, with a mean of 38.7 months or a total of 1,006 patient-years. The long term survival computed up to six years shows a 65 +/- 3.8% (standard error of the mean) for the entire group. The aortic valve group survival was 71 +/- 5.6%; the mitral valve group 60 +/- 8.2%; and the combined procedures group was 64 +/- 5.3%. Postoperative functional improvement was significant with 71.8% of the survivors in Class I and 19.6% in Class II.

NII underwent autophosphorylation on beta subunits. Fractions of alpha and alpha' polypeptides also occurred as phosphoforms as shown by alkaline phosphatase treatment. In addition, alpha' subunit had another motif for heterogeneity, which separated alpha' polypeptides into two groups, and was exemplified by NIIa and NIIb that showed different enzyme kinetics and the nuclear localization.

Liability, when found, has been based on one or more of the UCC Article Two warranties. This article discusses these warranties and those cases in which hospitals and doctors have been held liable under them. While the number of such cases is small, there are arguments that suggest that liability under these circumstances could increase in the future.

The dropouts (n = 19) were significantly more likely to be single, separated, or divorced, to be male, and to be diagnosed as having co-existing antisocial personality disorder than the followed-up probands (n = 69). In terms of global functioning, over the 2-year follow-up period, 61 (87.7%) of the 69 probands were judged to be functioning normally less than 50% of the follow-up interval. Using logistic regression, two variables, initial impulse action scores and poor premorbid functioning, predicted poor versus good outcome.

In most Group III lesions, the proliferative cell zones were found at the upper third level of the mucosa, whereas they were confined to the middle third and to the lower third level in the normal pyloric and in the intestinalized mucosa, respectively. The smallest Group III lesion was a single gland dysplasia, in which the Group III cells were confined to the middle level of the mucosa. These findings suggested that the Group III lesion must be a change initiated in the neck stem cells of the pyloric mucosa as is the case in the intestinal metaplasia. The Group III cells arising at the neck region surge upwards and then accumulate in the upper part of the foveola to form an aberrant proliferative focus from which a lesion develops by budding. This morphogenesis manifests an adenomatous nature of the lesion. However, there was apparently a spectrum of cytological and histological abnormalities which varied from the lesions which might be considered to be a kind of intestinalized tubule, to the typical Group III lesion. Some Group III lesions imitating the intestinal metaplasia contained the proliferative cell zones at the middle level of the mucosa, indicating that a group of the dysplastic tubules arose zonally, not from a single gland. This morphogenesis reflects a metaplastic nature of the lesion.

HLA matching is associated significantly with factors including CsA use, ALS use, recipient race, prior graft loss, presensitization, preservation time and most strongly, with organ sharing.

HLA-A,B, and DR matching have independent and essentially equivalent benefits on graft survival in CsA-treated patients, whereas HLA-A,B matching has a greater benefit in non-CsA-treated patients. 4. Organ sharing, per se, provides no direct detrimental effect on graft survival by univariate or multivariate analysis. 5. By multivariate and univariate analyses, shared/well-matched kidneys provide significantly better graft survival than local/poorly matched kidneys. 6. Delayed graft function is associated in a complex relationship with organ sharing, prior graft failure, presensitization, and CsA use. 7. The increased rate of delayed graft function associated with organ sharing is overcome by the benefit of good HLA matching. 8.

Currently, decisions regarding the management of patients are made on the basis of clinical staging that has an error rate of 34-39% (when surgical staging is used as the standard). To investigate the value of MR in staging patients with IB cervical cancer, we performed prospective MR examinations in 27 patients who had cervical carcinoma. Of these, 10 were clinically staged as having IB cervical carcinoma and underwent radical hysterectomy, providing specimens for pathologic correlation. In six of these 10 patients, the extent of disease had been underestimated during clinical examination under anesthesia. These six patients would have received radiation therapy before surgery had the MR information been used at the treatment-planning stage. MR imaging correlated better with surgical pathology than did clinical examination under anesthesia in determining the location and extent of tumor.

By univariate analysis, patients who started MTX therapy later in the study, American blacks, younger patients, those with less severe disease, and those with less frequent or less severe toxic events appeared to have a better probability of continuing the drug therapy. When these parameters were evaluated by multivariate analysis, only the time when MTX was started and the occurrence of toxic effects independently influenced the probability of continuing MTX.

In this study, we used positron emission computed tomography, which can detect brain activity by providing quantitative measurements of the metabolic rates of oxygen and glucose. Without sound signals, the auditory cortices of the patient showed remarkably low metabolic rates. However, with the cochlear implant device, the activity returned to near normal levels.

Culturing of cells in the presence of insulin induced a dose-dependent down-regulation of insulin binding with a maximal effect of 35% at an insulin concentration of 1.7 X 10(-7) mol/l. The number of high-affinity sites decreased from 110 000 to 70 000 sites per cell in control and down-regulated cells, respectively, with no change in the apparent affinity constant. Down-regulation was found to be rapid (t 1/2 = 3 h) and fully reversible. Culturing of cells in the presence of cycloheximide (0.1 mmol/l) or Tris (35 mmol/l) resulted in a further time-dependent increase in insulin-induced receptor loss with no effect on insulin binding to control cells. The action of both agents was found to be additive reaching a down-regulation of 51% after a culture period of 16 h. Recovery of insulin binding activity after removal of insulin remained unaffected in the presence of cycloheximide, whereas Tris inhibited this process by 74%. In conclusion our results show that the concept of insulin-induced receptor down regulation can be extended to the adult heart muscle. Moreover the data suggest involvement of protein synthesis and receptor recycling in this process.", "PMC3369945": "The complete nucleotide sequence of the neuraminidase (NA) gene of influenza virus A/Chile/1/83 (H1N1) has been determined after reverse transcription and cloning into the plasmid pAT 153/PvuII/8. The gene is 1461 nucleotides long and codes for a protein of 470 amino acids. The overall nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the A/Chile/1/83 NA exhibits a high homology with other N1 neuraminidases. Hyper-variable regions concerning A to G exchanges are discussed.", "PMC3739818": "Success in a stop-smoking treatment program was compared in patients who received behavioral treatment alone (BT) or behavioral treatment plus Nicorette gum (NT). The proportion of nonsmokers at the end of the 10-week program was higher with the groups receiving BT (82%) than in those receiving NT (50%). While the groups differed in their initial tolerance levels and number of previous quit attempts, the data suggest that the addition of Nicorette gum did not confer a substantial advantage over BT alone.", "PMC3571207": "In the bacterial luciferase reaction, light emission is due to the mixed function oxidation of FMNH2 and long chain aldehydes, which leads to the formation of an electronically excited product species, postulated to be luciferase-bound 4a-hydroxy flavin. In the present work it was found that H2O2 stimulates an additional and kinetically distinct luminescence. The stimulation is more apparent in reactions inhibited by long chain alcohols, and the H2O2 is effective even if added secondarily. The stimulation requires H2O2 only at the outset; its subsequent destruction by catalase does not diminish the response, appreciably.", "PMC3966901": "We treated a case of laryngeal trauma in which difficulty in high-pitched phonation was the main feature of a voice problem. We emphasize the importance of phonatory function tests in determining the mechanism of voice disorders and in monitoring the effects of treatment. Physical examination, phonatory function tests, computed tomographic scan, and electromyogram disclosed that the voice problem was caused by a fracture of the thyroid cartilage and its fixation against the cricoid cartilage. An open reduction yielded recovery of the phonatory function.", "PMC3895005": "A simplified method of renal scintigraphy carried out with 131I-Hippuran and 99mTc-DTPA diethylenetriaminopentacetate is described in man. Results were expressed as tubular clearance (with Hippuran) and glomerular clearance (with DTPA) per kidney, and compared to PAH and inulin clearances measured in the same patients. There was a close positive correlation between clearances calculated by means of renal scintigraphy and those measured by standard procedure for studying renal function. This study showed that a simple calculation allowed to express scintigraphical findings in terms of clearance.", "PMC4090453": "The authors present the results from the microbiological and clinical studies about the potentialities of pipemidinic acid in the treatment of uroinfections. Pipemidinic acid was established with the study on 375 bacterial strains, isolated from the urine of urological patients to have a very good in vitro effect as regards E. coli, Citrobacter, Proteus retgeri, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella and Enterobacter, and in case of those microorganisms, it gives way only to some aminoglucoside antibiotics. The admit that with those causative agents of uroinfections, the pipemidinic acid could be the agent of choice. The percentage of susceptible strains is low in case of Seratia, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas and Acunetobacter. Sanation of the uroinfection was attained in 56.2 per cent of the patients from the 32 patients treated with persistent, most often nosocomial uroinfection, by the pipemidinic acid (in the form of the preparation palin), and a reduction of the bacterial number to insignificant values--in 12,6%. Obvious clinical improvement was established in almost all patients treated, manifested with fading or considerable reduction of the subjective and physical symptoms of the uroinfection, in parallel with a normalization or improvement of the paraclinical laboratory indices as well. In conclusion, it was emphasized that the introduction of that uroantiseptic in the practice will broaden the possibilities of effective treatment of uroinfections.", "PMC4034651": "The pharmacokinetics of ethimizol were studied in healthy volunteers given 1 mg/kg i.v. or 2 mg/kg orally. The serum concentrations of ethimizol were determined by HPLC. After i.v. infusion the kinetics of ethimizol could be described by a one-compartment model in 4 and by a two-compartment model in 1 subject. The elimination half-lives ranged from 34.1 to 79.2 min and the apparent volumes of distribution from 0.4 to 1.3 l/kg. After oral administration, the absorption half-lives ranged from 7.3 to 57.1 min. The absolute bioavailability varied between 3.6 and 22.2%. The binding of ethimizol to plasma proteins was less than 10%.", "PMC2682763": "Skeletal scintigraphy has a high sensitivity but low specificity in early detection and follow up of hip diseases. Unexplained hip pain or indistinct X-rays may be the reason for scintigraphic examination. On the other hand, there is a wide range of clinical indications for nuclear medicine examination, such as metastatic and primary malignant disease, tumor-like lesions, inflammatory, infectious, degenerative and avascular diseases, and posttraumatic and postoperative changes. White blood cell scintigraphy is highly sensitive and highly specific in the detection of infectious disease of the hip. In the vast majority of cases, physiologic or postoperative granulocytic accumulation can be differentiated from infectious accumulation, which requires therapy.", "PMC4010293": "A total of 348 consecutive primary alcoholics entering an alcoholism treatment program comprised Group 1 (172 men who were offered disulfiram and agreed to take it) and Group 2 (176 who were eligible to take the drug but refused). Information was gathered at the time of intake into the program through personal interviews with patients and two resource persons. The clinical course in the 12 months after discharge was determined by follow-up interviews with patients and one resource person. The two groups were demographically similar at intake and there were no significant differences in outcome. However, at intake those men who agreed to take disulfiram and subsequently did well were more affluent, more likely to be married and less likely to have spent time in jail prior to treatment, and drank less often than those men who refused. Thus, although agreeing to take disulfiram was not associated with an improved outcome overall, men with more social stability and less pervasive problems may be the ones most likely to benefit from the drug.", "PMC3737530": "The effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of turkey prolactin on food intake of turkey hens was studied. Adult, nonlaying medium-weight turkey hens, exposed to 6 hr of light per day, were used in Experiment 1. In Experiments 2 and 3, medium-weight and large-weight turkey hens, respectively, exposed to a long photoperiod and in production, were used. Prolactin was injected into free-feeding hens at doses ranging from 800 to 3200 ng. The ICV injection of prolactin had no significant effect on food intake of hens maintained under 6 hr light per day and not in egg production. In hens exposed to long photoperiods and in egg production, the ICV injection of prolactin caused a significant decrease in food intake. These results suggest that prolactin, acting at the level of the central nervous system, decreases food intake in photostimulated turkey hens.", "PMC2644719": "Sixty-six patients undergoing cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to receive either intercostal blockade with bupivacaine supplemented with papaveretum or papaveretum alone for postoperative analgesia. Both groups were similar regarding distribution of sex, age, and weight. These two groups were compared. Patients who did not have intercostal blockade required postoperative analgesia sooner. There was no significant difference, however, in the total consumption of papaveretum. Both groups experienced similar degrees of pain, and there were no differences in postoperative pulmonary function. We conclude that although single intercostal blockade is an effective analgesic, it does not improve pain relief and does not improve pulmonary function after cholecystectomy when compared with a regimen of on-demand, intramuscularly administered papaveretum.", "PMC3973310": "Eighty-three oral food challenges were performed on 25 patients with a history of immediate adverse reaction to foods. Seventy-one food challenges were performed in 24 patients, whereas 12 placebos were administered to nine patients. Of the 71 food challenges observed, 12 were positive in 10 patients. All challenges with placebo were negative. Doses of challenge foods provoking observable reactions ranged from 5 to 100 gm. The clinical signs and symptoms noted on food challenge reproduced those reported by history. Reactions were mild, generally self-limited, and were not accompanied by elevations in urinary histamine. A plasma histamine elevation was observed in one patient. A 10- to 12-mo follow-up survey of nine patients with negative food challenges revealed that six patients had resumed eating the challenge food on a regular basis without experiencing adverse reactions, whereas three patients continued to avoid the challenge food. All 10 patients with positive food challenges continued to avoid the challenge food.", "PMC2823772": "The pathogenesis of infectious bursal disease (IBD) in chickens neonatally chemically bursectomized (CB) by cyclophosphamide and subsequently inoculated with various numbers of bursal cells was examined. CB chickens inoculated with at least 62.5 X 10(6) bursal cells were as susceptible to IBD clinical manifestations (as determined by gross and microscopic evaluation of bursal tissues, virus recovery from spleen, and antibody titer) as intact chickens following inoculation with virus at 5 weeks of age. In contrast, CB chickens inoculated with 2.5 X 10(6) or fewer bursal cells were refractory to the IBD clinical manifestations compared with intact chickens or CB chickens inoculated with 62.5 X 10(6) or more bursal cells. Results from this study suggest that the availability of a large number of bursal cells is an essential factor in the development of IBD.", "PMC2823774": "Reovirus strains CO8 and 81-5, isolated from chickens with malabsorption syndrome, and reovirus strain 176, isolated from chickens with tenosynovitis, were each individually inoculated into 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks. Strain CO8 caused tenosynovitis and pericarditis following footpad inoculation, but it was of low pathogenicity when given by either oral or subcutaneous route. In contrast, strains 81-5 and 176 were highly pathogenic and caused severe mortality following subcutaneous inoculation. Lesions included hepatic necrosis, bursal atrophy, thymitis, and splenic hyperplasia; strain 81-5 also caused pericarditis and myocarditis. Although strain 176 caused higher mortality than strain 81-5, these two strains differed little in the severity and distribution of the lesions they caused. No signs or lesions of typical malabsorption syndrome were observed.", "PMC3431814": "A case of cavernous hemangioma of the iris is reported which could be diagnosed without histopathological examination on the basis of clinical observations, particularly of the characteristic changes occurring in fluorescein angiography. The importance of fluorescein angiography in the differential diagnosis of angioma of the iris is stressed.", "PMC3131596": "This report describes the geno- and immunophenotypic analysis of the Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines HDLM-2, KM-H2, and L-428. The lines were all positive for the antigens CD15 (Leu-M1), CD30 (Ki-1), Hefi-1 (antigen detected by a monoclonal antibody produced against L-428), HLA class I and II, and activation/proliferation markers. The cells from all 3 cell lines lacked almost all cell lineage-associated/specific markers: HDLM-2 was only CD2+, KM-H2 was only CD9+ and CD21+, and L-428 was negative for all the specific markers tested. Genomic analysis of HDLM-2 cells revealed monoclonal rearrangements of T cell receptor beta and gamma loci and germ line configuration of immunoglobulin genes. Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were rearranged in KM-H2 and L-428. These data suggest a possible lymphoid origin for HDLM-2, KM-H2, and L-428. Although the data presented do not provide formal proof of a lymphoid nature of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells and do not unequivocally exclude a derivation from other hematopoietic cells, extrapolation of the results from the in vitro cultures to the in vivo situation suggests a lymphoid (T or B cell) origin of these cells.", "PMC3260217": "B6 mice heterozygous at the lpr locus (B6 +/lpr and B6 lpr/+) were compared with lpr homozygous mice (B6 lpr/lpr) and control mice (B6 +/+) for levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig), presence of autoantibodies and rate of B-cell membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) capping. The total serum Ig levels in B6 +/lpr and B6 lpr/+ mice remained much below the high titres found in B6 lpr/lpr mice, and were close to the titres found in B6 +/+ mice. However, the presence of anti-single-stranded (ss) DNA antibodies and of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) was detected in most B6 +/lpr and B6 lpr/+ mice, although less frequently and in lower titres than in B6 lpr/lpr mice. The rate of mIg capping was higher in B6 +/lpr and B6 lpr/+ mice than in B6 +/+ mice, but the acceleration of the capping process remained inferior to the one found in B6 lpr/lpr mice. Therefore, the lpr locus is not totally recessive: some B-cell hyperactivity is expressed in the heterozygous state. This is in contrast with its lack of expression at the level of lympho-proliferation of the lpr-characteristic T-cell subset: none of the lpr heterozygous B6 mice displayed detectable lymphadenopathy.", "PMC3958141": "Bacteroides gingivalis has been implicated in various forms of periodontal disease and may be responsible for other diseases in humans. The role of B. gingivalis in disease has been difficult to assess, because it is inhibited by most selective media commonly used by clinical laboratories to aid in isolating gram-negative, nonsporeforming anaerobes. We have developed a new medium, Bacteroides gingivalis agar, which contains bacitracin, colistin, and nalidixic acid as selective agents. This medium allowed B. gingivalis to be isolated from oral specimens with little difficulty and also allowed B. gingivalis to be isolated from phenotypically similar Bacteroides species, such as B. asaccharolyticus and B. endodontalis, with which it can easily be confused.", "PMC4051255": "Hypoplasia of the right ventricle occurring as an isolated abnormality is an uncommon cause of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Its presentation in the newborn may mimic the ductus dependent and less stable right ventricular hypoplasias such as tricuspid atresia and pulmonary atresia. However, the natural history of this abnormality contrasts with those ductus dependent lesions by the rather benign course it presents. A patient with only marked reduction in right ventricular size and commensurate reduction in size of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves is described. Although cyanotic this child has shown none of the critical problems frequently encountered with the more severe forms of the right ventricular hypoplasias.", "PMC3680412": "A simple and precise ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the determination of sennoside A and B in Rhei Rhizoma. A reversed-phase chromatographic system consisting of a chemically bonded ODS silica gel column with an acetate buffer (pH 5.0)-acetonitrile (68:32), containing 5 mM tetra-n-heptylammonium bromide, as the mobile phase was used. Sennoside A and B in this crude drug were separated and determined within 20 min after direct injection of the solution extracted with 70% methanol. The results for various samples are presented.", "PMC539352": "The criteria used presently for evaluating the materials for haemotherapy, which are based on chemical, physicochemical and biological extracts of aqueous solutions have been found to differ from the results observed after actual prolonged contact of these materials with blood and its elements. All the investigated plastic materials complied with the required quality standards, and, despite this, some of them, such as natural latex or siliconized rubber, caused considerable adhesion of proteins, release of high amounts of haemoglobin from the erythrocytes, and have been found even most thrombogenic of all 8 plastic materials tested. Investigations by means of scanning microscopy demonstrated that adhesion of fibrinogen and thrombocytes to the surface of the plastic materials depended to a high extent on the smoothness of this surface. It depended also on migration of components specific for each material. This was also the cause of variations in the adsorption of albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen labelled with 125I after their mixing with plasma.", "PMC3584069": "A thermostable polygalacturonate lyase (PL; EC 4.2.2.2) was secreted by Thermomonospora fusca during stationary phase in pectin-mineral salts medium at 52 degrees C. Biosynthesis was induced by addition of pectic substances to cultures growing on glucose or cellulose but not cellobiose; the disaccharide repressed enzyme synthesis and triggered inactivation of enzyme previously secreted. The PL, purified to electrophoretic and serologic homogeneity, had a molecular size of 56 kilodaltons and an isoelectric point at pH 4.16. The amino acid composition closely resembled that of the major extracellular endoglucanases of the actinomycete. The enzyme had six cystine residues but no detectable sulfhydryl groups. It was inactivated by mild reducing agents and activated by oxygenation, indicating the necessity for disulfide bond maintenance. Temperature and pH optima for the PL reaction were 60 degrees C and 10.45, respectively. Calcium was essential for activity but not stability; calcium dependence curves were altered by low concentrations of toxic metals. The Km for pectin increased 30,000-fold as the percent esterification (methoxylation) of that substrate was increased from 0 to 60%. The size of the minimal susceptible site for PL attack on the pectin molecule was calculated as being equivalent to 10 unesterified residues, based on the correlation of Km values at various degrees of esterification with the percentage of cleavable bonds predicted by a random-number-generating computer program.", "PMC3780514": "A sharp increase in the blood cholesterol level due to cholesterol introduction to rabbits for 2 months (per os, 0.25 g/kg of the body weight) causes multiple light cellular microadenomas in zonae fasciculata and reticularis in 13 of 17 rabbits 7.5 months after the beginning of the experiment.", "PMC3621597": "Existing methods for the estimation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) normally require sophisticated, expensive instrumentation. An alternative is an enzymatic spectrophotometric method but this requires relatively large volumes of blood and is rather time-consuming. A simple enzymatic fluorimetric method for the measurement of the BCAA in microliter samples of plasma is described here. The method is based on the oxidative deamination of L-leucine, L-isoleucine and L-valine by leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus species. The NADH which is formed in stoichiometric quantities is estimated fluorimetrically. In the presence of the ketone-trapping agent hydrazine the reaction goes to completion in an alkaline incubation medium at 37 degrees C. By this method the combined BCAA can be measured routinely in 20 microliter sample of plasma. The test exhibits acceptable precision and reproducibility.", "PMC2248740": "One hundred thirty-six children with otitis media with effusion of at least 2 months' duration were investigated in a strict, double-blind, randomized prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of oral steroids in the treatment of this disease. The results of our study showed a significant complete and partial recovery from otitis media with effusion in the group treated by a combination of antibiotics (amoxicillin) and oral steroids (prednisone), compared with an amoxicillin-treated group and a placebo-treated group. We believe that this treatment mostly benefits children aged 4 to 10 years without oversized adenoids. The findings of our study imply that a combined course of antibiotics and oral steroids deserves its place as a routine conservative trial before surgery.", "PMC1847519": "An alternative approach to structure-function analysis of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) gene products and their interactions with one another during each phase of the viral life cycle is described. We showed previously by using the vaccinia virus-T7 RNA polymerase expression system that when cells expressing the nucleocapsid protein (N), the phosphoprotein (NS), and the large polymerase protein (L) of VSV were superinfected with defective interfering (DI) particles, rapid and efficient replication and amplification of (DI) particle RNA occurred. Here, we demonstrate that all five VSV proteins can be expressed simultaneously when cells are contransfected with plasmids containing the matrix protein (M) gene and the glycoprotein (G) gene of VSV in addition to plasmids containing the genes for the N, NS, and L proteins. When cells coexpressing all five VSV proteins were superinfected with DI particles, which because of their defectiveness are unable to express any viral proteins or to replicate, DI particle replication, assembly, and budding were observed and infectious DI particles were released into the culture fluids. Omission of either the M or G protein expression resulted in no DI particle budding. The vector-supported DI particles were similar in size and morphology to the authentic DI particles generated from cells coinfected with DI particles and helper VSV and their infectivity could be blocked by anti-VSV or anti-G antiserum. The successful replication, assembly, and budding of DI particles from cells expressing all five VSV proteins from cloned cDNAs provide a powerful approach for detailed structure-function analysis of the VSV gene products in each step of the replicative cycle of the virus."}
